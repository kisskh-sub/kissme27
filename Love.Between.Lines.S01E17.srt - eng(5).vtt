[Episode 17]

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.240
Mr. Xiao,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.850
I'm leaving for the day.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.810
Hold on.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.430
Hasn't Hu Xiu

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.470
finished inspecting
the construction site yet?

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.750
I just called to check.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.240
She said the inspection's done,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.800
but she needs to make a run to Forma
with Mr. Pei

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.660
to pick up some supplier materials,

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.920
so she won't be coming back to the studio.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.960
Alright.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.550
Alright.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.310
The steel and sand-and-gravel suppliers

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.280
are both reputable,
long-established manufacturers,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.470
so there shouldn't be any issues.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.430
As for the other suppliers and studios,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.310
we'll discuss things internally first

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.110
and then get back to you, Mr. Pei.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.900
It's already this hour.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.829
Why don't we have dinner together?

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.079
I don't want to impose.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.810
It's just staff meal.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.870
You don't need to be so formal, Ms. Hu.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.030
Besides,

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.030
our partner has come all this way.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.560
If we can't even offer a meal,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.590
word might get out

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.120
and make Forma look stingy.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.870
Let's go.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.280
I'll show you around

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.590
Forma's staff cafeteria while we're at it.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.190
You'll be coming here often.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.430
Alright.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.870
So, what do you think?

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.930
Regret not choosing Forma back then?

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.400
Not at all.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.940
Being Forma's partner is quite nice too.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.079
Take more of whatever dishes you like.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.880
Are you home yet?

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.240
Not yet.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.450
Still haven't finished the inspection?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.909
It's finished.

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.640
Just getting ready for dinner.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.159
With whom?

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.360
With Mr. Pei.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.510
Staff meal.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.920
But

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.950
as far as I know,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.750
employees aren't obligated

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.200
to report their after-work activities
to their boss, right?

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.520
Your sketchbook

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.160
has been packed into my box.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.920
Come get it.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.900
Done chatting?

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.770
Is there something urgent?

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.850
No, nothing.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.310
Try this.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.280
These are all signature dishes.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.840
Since you took it by mistake,

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.470
shouldn't you be the one returning it?

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.130
Why am I the one going to get it?

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.270
Where exactly is it?

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:53.490
Xiaorou,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.390
you're back.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.480
Listen,

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.620
there's that dripping sound again.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.160
Got it.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.240
Let's call it a day.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.070
Okay.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.540
I'm leaving then, Xiaorou.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.360
Mr. Pei, please stop here.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.420
This is far enough.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.240
It's getting late.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.430
Let me drive you home.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.830
That won't be necessary.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.620
I'll see my own employee back, of course.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.270
Mr. Xiao?

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.370
Mr. Xiao, are you also here
to visit Forma's cafeteria?

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.460
I've brought this here to you.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.800
I didn't ask you to bring it here.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.670
I'll give it to you in the car.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.440
Why not let Ms. Hu choose for herself

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.970
whose car she wants to take?

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.240
Why force it, Mr. Xiao?

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.000
Ms. Hu?

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.790
Thank you for your hospitality today.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.020
I won't trouble you further, Mr. Pei.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.020
See you next time.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:01.870
Goodbye.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.020
Got the suppliers' information?

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.840
It's all here.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.750
I've discussed and confirmed
the steel, cement,

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.549
and sand-and-gravel manufacturers
with Mr. Pei.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.010
For glass and coatings,
Forma has two supplier options

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.669
with some price differences.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.250
I've specified our technical requirements.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.320
As for the details,

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.510
you can take a look at the materials
before making a decision.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.000
As for 3D-printed ceramic
building material supplier,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.340
there are even more options

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.270
since the technology
is controlled by Forma itself.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.550
What's wrong?

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:06.960
Mr. Xiao.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.300
I've finished reporting my work.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.400
Do you have any other questions?

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:13.960
No.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.360
I'll make a decision
after reviewing the materials.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.160
If it wasn't so urgent, Mr. Xiao,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.240
why did you rush all the way to Forma?

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.310
Are you upset

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.350
because I had dinner with Mr. Pei?

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.960
But we're partners with him now.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.890
I shouldn't really need to
avoid meeting him, right?

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.500
Since you care so much,

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.850
why don't you just
kick me out of the project, Mr. Xiao?

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.650
You're doing well on this project.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.650
I have no reason to kick you out of it.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.030
Mr. Gong?

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.760
Why is he calling me?

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.780
What is it, Mr. Gong?

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:10.150
Hu Xiu.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.750
You need to come right away.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.990
Mr. Gong, what's wrong?

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.700
Follow me.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.670
Why is the café already closed?

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.240
This isn't Zhao's usual closing time.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:33.840
Exactly.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.200
I was about to go home,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.790
but when I passed by

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.320
and glanced over,

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.030
I saw her...

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.150
I'd never seen her
like that before, either.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.410
It really startled me.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:44.790
Look.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.700
She's still like this.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.410
She was already like this
when I passed by.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.150
Think about it, that was
quite a while ago.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.360
Even as someone who doesn't sell coffee,
I know

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.460
that once the beans are ground,
you're supposed to drink it right away,

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.630
otherwise the flavor disappears quickly.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.910
The café's already closed,

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.970
so why is she grinding so much coffee?

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.100
Could it be

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.320
she's possessed or something?

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.130
Zhao.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.870
Zhao, what happened?

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.910
What happened?

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.150
Zhao.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.320
No matter what happened,

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.720
you can tell me.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.720
It's okay.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.050
I'm always here for you.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:39.510
Stop grinding it.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.510
Talk to me.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.390
Stop grinding it, alright?

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.080
Zhao,

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.240
stop it.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.140
Wang Guangming...

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.210
Is having an affair.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.120
Does it hurt?

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:40.960
Honey,

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.910
are you still at the café?

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.530
It's already this hour.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:45.950
I'll come pick you up.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:47.850
Reply for me, please.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.450
I don't know what to say to him.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.550
Just tell him

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.130
I'm staying with you today

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.450
and not going home.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.720
Zhao,

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.840
whatever decision you make,

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.840
I'll be with you.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.460
Then right now, I just want to

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:29.850
sleep for a bit.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.600
I'm tired.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.380

I was worried you might need something,

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.610

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:30.710
Hu Xiu isn't here.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.600
She went home early in the morning
to change clothes.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.860
Said she had a meeting.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.120
I see.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.360
Thanks.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:40.480
Mr. Xiao.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.030
Even though I don't know

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.020
what exactly happened

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.850
between you and Xiu,

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.670
I know her well.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.480
She may seem fine on the surface lately,

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.360
but actually, when you moved out,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.420
she couldn't even enjoy the New Year.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.910
Xiu

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.160
has always been very sincere and serious
with people

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.819
and with everything she does.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.790
Maybe you should try

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.829
being a bit more honest with her.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:24.859
Hello, Zhao.

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:26.030
I bought you breakfast.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.720
It's on the table.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.180
Try to eat at least a little

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.720
and get some proper rest.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.510
Don't worry.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.350
I'm okay.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.200
You didn't get to work late, did you?

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.710
No, I timed it perfectly.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.180
I'm already at Forma now.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.880
I'll come find you at the café

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.750
after I get off work.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:39.410
Bye-bye...

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:54.320
Take it slow.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:55.610
We still have time.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.680
Thanks a lot, Mr. Pei.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.170
Didn't sleep well last night?

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:04.340
Let's go.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.640
Mr. Xiao.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:22.510
Sun.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.640
Morning, Engineer Sun.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.550
Mr. Pei.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.000
Hu.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:28.960
I'm sorry

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.820
for being late.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.350
If my watch is correct,

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.270
we're not late.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.240
Right on time.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:35.000
Mr. Pei,

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.890
although we're working together,

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.310
you're from the engineering side

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.170
and our studio is the design side.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:42.110
The way you used the word "we" just now

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.110
wasn't really appropriate, was it?

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:45.680
Sure.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.310
Everything you say is correct, Mr. Xiao.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:51.710
The elevator is here.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.860
Mr. Pei, which floor is
the meeting room on?

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:14.100
Mr. Pei.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:16.900
Do you usually press the elevator button
for your employees too?

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.900
Not really.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.590
Ms. Hu is the only exception.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.320
It's not the first time anyway.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.960
Ms. Hu, you might not remember.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.150
It was when you came to Forma
for an interview

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.680
and were taking the elevator down
afterward.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.100
So you were that person
in the elevator that day.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.830
Sorry, I didn't really notice.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.080
It's alright.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.440
It's just a pity

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.070
that you didn't choose Forma
in the end, Ms. Hu.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.660
But aren't you working together now
anyway?

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.590
That shows Mr. Pei and Hu
were meant to cross paths...

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.200
It only shows Forma failed to
recognize talent

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.460
and couldn't keep her.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.550
All I can say is that
Ms. Hu is very outstanding—

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.350
she ended up becoming a partner
of Forma after all.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.320
Thank you.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:30.970
This helps replenish
your energy and blood.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:32.500
It's the healthier option.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.300
Thank you.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.240
I'll begin now.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.640
The suppliers provided by Mr. Pei cover
a very comprehensive range of categories.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.480
This is the shortlist our studio
put together after an initial evaluation.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.680
For steel, cement, and sand and gravel,

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.550
as I discussed with Mr. Pei yesterday,

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:03.400
we'll go with state-owned enterprises
with absolute quality guarantees.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.070
Taking all factors into account,

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.480
I've compiled a shortlist of manufacturers

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.880
as reference recommendations.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.110
For waterproofing
and insulation materials,

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.510
we recommend Shunke Chemical;

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.310
and for timber,

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:14.960
Qisheng Timber.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.580
Excuse me, let me interrupt.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.160
I see that Qisheng's quotation
is relatively high.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.820
Why do you recommend Qisheng?

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.030
Because timber has
relatively high requirements

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.640
for temperature and moisture,

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.190
the shorter the transportation distance,

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.060
the lower the transport costs.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.160
Qisheng's factory

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.310
is very close to Shanghai,

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.920
so the transportation losses are minimal.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.790
When you factor everything in,

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.450
their overall cost actually ends up lower
than other factories'.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.940
Do you have any other questions, Mr. Pei?

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.290
Your analysis is very professional,
Ms. Hu.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.160
As for decorative stonework,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.880
we recommend Mingzhu Building Materials,

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.720
because their product range
is very comprehensive,

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.590
and their colors and textures

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:53.390
can better reproduce
the intended design effect.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.370
Ms. Hu's analysis is indeed
very comprehensive.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.840
Do you have any
different opinions, Mr. Xiao?

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.790
I think we have better options.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.820
So which supplier do you prefer, Mr. Xiao?

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.680
You might as well say it outright.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.160
At the end of last year,

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.400
Forma took on a hot spring hotel project

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.510
and used materials

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.030
supplied by Jiahao Stone.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.520
For the library project
the year before that,

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.670
the timber supplier was
China Resources Industrial.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.640
And the amusement park project
from some time ago—

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.880
although it wasn't publicly announced—

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.780
I recall the supplier was Fenghe,

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.400
right?

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.330
What do you mean by that, Mr. Xiao?

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.680
What I mean is

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.420
that this set of supplier information
is incomplete.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.870
I need the full list of Forma's
partner manufacturers

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:41.000
before I can give
the most appropriate recommendation.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.600
Forma works with a number of suppliers

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.200
and we update them frequently.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.000
It's difficult to list them all.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.400
But we can guarantee that

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.790
for the Lyman project,

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.240
only the best ones will be used.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.900
Since we're working together,

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.160
I'd still like to take all suppliers
into consideration

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.890
and select the optimal option.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.510
Alright.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.300
Since you've requested it, Mr. Xiao,

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.970
Forma will recheck everything

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.770
and prepare a complete set
of supplier materials.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.040
Alright then.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.830
We'll wait until
Mr. Pei has all the materials ready,

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.090
and we can discuss it further afterward.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:38.590
Xiaorou.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.480
Why did you grind so much coffee?

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.210
Do we have a big order coming in?

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.150
Xiaorou?

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:49.590
What's wrong?

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:51.170
Nothing.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.230
[Honey, let's have dinner together
tonight. I've got good news to share.]

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.160
Xiaorou,

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.230
the pipe has burst.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.100
What happened now?

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:27.660
Oh my.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:28.550
This...

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:31.850
Ms. Zhao,

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.250
where are your water meter
and main switch?

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.070
Upstairs.

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:43.910
Are you here yet?

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:48.970
Boss, what are your orders?

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:49.890
Quick, come in.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.240
You and Fei,

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.030
go over there

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.990
and move all the furniture upstairs.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.680
Hurry up, you two!

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.340
Mop up all the water over here.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.590
Remember to turn on
the air conditioner's heating

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:00.070
and let it run for a couple of days
to dry things out.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.720
Otherwise, all these

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.510
wooden floors and wooden furniture

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:02.310
will be ruined.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.910
Got it.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.590
Ms. Zhao,

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.710
I've contacted the industrial park's
property management.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.380
The repair technician
will contact you directly.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.880
You should close the café for today.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.750
Thank you.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.060
No problem.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.990
Just think about how you'll thank me
properly later.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:16.550
Fei, you can't do it that way.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:47.880
Ms. Zhao.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.240
Everything's mostly cleaned up.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:49.880
Well...

00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.090
Ms. Zhao.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:04.610
Are...

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:06.990
Are you okay?

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.770
I was too careless.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.550
A long time ago,

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:17.030
my assistant mentioned to me

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.680
that there was a dripping sound
in the café,

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.680
but I didn‘t pay much attention.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.720
Later,

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.240
the dripping became more frequent,

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.900
and I could hear it too,

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.840
but I didn't think
it was anything serious.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.240
And today,

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.080
the pipe finally burst.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:53.480
In fact,

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.440
the cracks had been there all along,

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.980
and the warnings had been given.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.480
I just failed to notice them.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.030
It's understandable

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.080
that you didn't pay much attention

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.190
to such a small matter.

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.060
Besides,

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:20.820
it's not too late
now that you've realized it.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.240
If it really can't be fixed,

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.170
just replace it—

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.200
no big deal.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:35.750
Right.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.270
It wasn't a big deal.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.280
I just didn't pay attention.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.080
Stop squatting here.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:48.350
Hurry and go change your clothes.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.410
Don't catch a cold.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.270
Okay.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:00.650
These...

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:02.960
These shoes of yours can't get wet,
can they?

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.290
They're all soaked now.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.140
Let me compensate you for them.

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:06.820
No need.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.480
These are just old shoes anyway.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.480
Besides, we are neighbors.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:12.030
Don't worry about it.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.920
It's really nice to be rich.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.640
He just bought those shoes
the day before yesterday,

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.970
and now, they're "old."

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:57.640
Okay.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.660
Let's meet at the usual place.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.260
Mr. Xiao.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.980
Xiaohe and the others went to get the car.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.040
We can just meet them at the entrance.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:11.160
Mr. Pei.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.440
Please stop here.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:13.350
Once the materials arrive,

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.760
I'll coordinate the timing with you.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.690
Also, thank you for the jujube tea.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.440
You look much more energetic now.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.440
Get some good rest when you get back.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:21.680
Mr. Xiao.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.350
There will be plenty of work interactions
going forward.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.270
I don't have to report
every single contact

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.070
between Ms. Hu and me to you, do I?

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.370
Being so controlling as a boss,

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.520
be careful—you might end up
losing your employees too.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.790
Although Mr. Xiao
proposed a new plan today,

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.110
it doesn't take away from the fact

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.240
that Ms. Hu was well-prepared.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.030
Your presentation today
was very substantial.

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:42.720
I believe

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.000
our cooperation will be very pleasant.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.680
Thank you for your recognition.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.430
Goodbye, Mr. Pei.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:48.030
Take care.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.020
By the way, Mr. Pei.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.160
Let me answer your question from earlier.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:02.210
From now on, any contact you have
with Hu Xiu

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:03.470
must be reported to me.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:04.980
Also,

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.040
could you please
vary your poaching tactics?

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.510
Apart from expressing slight regret,

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.170
don't you have any new tricks?

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:14.710
How about

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.320
I sign you up for a training course?

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.770
I'll cover the tuition.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:36.160
Xiu.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.150
No need to come to the café today.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.470
I want some time alone.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:40.350
Okay.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.350
Let me know if you need anything.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:50.950
In the meeting just now, I...

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.250
Mr. Xiao.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.050
What was that?

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.530
What about the meeting?

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:55.590
Nothing.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.000
Xiaohe,

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.110
let's not go back to the office yet.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.040
To Lanjing Park.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.100
Get off.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.800
No need to bring your laptop.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.330
What are we doing here?

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.790
This is a new project we're working on.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:43.940
There's a trendy pop-up store

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.470
that contacted our studio.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.830
They want to build

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:48.680
a themed structure in this park.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.240
The project isn't finalized yet,

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.840
so we're just checking it out first,

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:52.920
mainly to relax a bit.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:53.350
Right.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.680
Let's shoot more footage here.
When we get back,

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.680
help me with the composition, will you?

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.880
After our last site visit,

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.920
I realized your aesthetic sense
is amazing.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.280
It's excellent, you know?

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.480
Let's take lots of photos

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.440
to put in the project proposal.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:04.920
-No problem.
-Do you have the proposal?

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.750
Actually, it's not that urgent...

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:06.110
Sure I do.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.170
I'll send it to you.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.270
Why didn't you send it to me earlier?

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.000
There's also a famous attraction here

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:11.920
called the Dark Corridor.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:12.790
If we have time later,

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:13.510
we should check it out too.

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:14.740
Maybe we can find inspiration from

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:15.920
that designer. What's his name again?

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.850
Let me think.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.920
His name is... That foreign designer...

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.510
He even won an award

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:21.000
for this design, you know?

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.680
Come here!

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:33.130
Coming.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.280
Sun, shoot from this angle.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.500
Shoot that.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.630
Check out this pic I just took.

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:41.160
How is it?

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.340
Not bad.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:42.920
Of course.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.270
Wait, wait.

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:44.640
Y-Your focus was off.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.440
Was it?

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.440
The focus should be on the foreground,

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.310
but you focused on the background.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:49.550
Your focal length wasn't right.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.880
You need to select this.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:52.110
Oh, I see.

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:53.230
The exposure is also clearer this way.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:53.830
Sun Yifei!

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.350
Next time...

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:55.550
Sun Yifei, come here.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:58.300
Go up a bit.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.160
You can capture the east side
of the project site there.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:01.760
Is that so?

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.640
Is it here, Mr. Xiao?

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.570
A little higher.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.810
Is it here, Mr. Xiao?

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.480
A little higher.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.130
Come with me.

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:26.410
I still can't see the project site
from here.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.300
Mr. Xiao...

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.930
Just now in the meeting,

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:46.720
I didn't mean to say
your supplier choice was bad.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:51.590
It's my fault.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:52.590
I didn't check

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:55.050
Forma's previous collaboration projects.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.860
Is this what you wanted to say in the car
just now?

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:01.810
So

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.780
we didn't come to the park for work?

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.410
I was worried about your mood.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.480
Mr. Xiao.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.150
I won't get carried away just because

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:15.610
a competitor flatters me,

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.040
nor will I hold a grudge
simply because my boss

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.070
points out my mistakes.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.469
You're overthinking it.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:27.480
I'm just

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:28.989
a bit worried about Zhao.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.440
If you're really concerned,

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:39.540
I can drive you to the café later

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.000
and give you half a day off.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:41.840
No need.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.260
She said she wants some time alone today.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.840
She's an adult.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.030
I think

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:49.730
she knows what she's doing.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.650
She's the type of person

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.550
who's strong-willed

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:55.320
and brave.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.360
She always says with love,
even water is filling;

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.960
and with love comes ability.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:02.920
I thought she had finally met someone

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.850
who wouldn't let down her courage.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.840
But now I see

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.120
she deserves better.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.360
Of course, I'm no better

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.760
in this regard myself—

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.180
just about the same as her.

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:20.910
I wonder how long it takes

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.190
to truly see someone for who they are.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.620
I'll go buy some water.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.800
There's also

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.150
a famous attraction here
called Dark Corridor.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:09.360
We should check it out later
if we have time.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:09.880
Here in this park?

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.440
Yes.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.630
When we go there,

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:13.030
we can look for project inspiration,

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.510
right?

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.000
Hu Xiu?

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:36.110
[Please touch the wall with your left hand
and bravely move forward]

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:39.110
[through the darkness, until you reach
the realm of love and light.]

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:44.280
Hu Xiu?

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.880
Xiaoyi.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:28.490
Put your blindfold on,

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.670
count to ten,

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.030
and then come find Daddy,

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.670
okay?

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.710
Okay.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:39.510
Ten.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.000
Nine.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.400
Eight.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:43.960
Seven.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:45.320
One!

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.920
Dad?

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.030
Dad?

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:51.320
Dad?

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.480
Dad?

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:57.560
Dad?

00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.190
Dad?

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.840
Dad?

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.590
Dad?

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.110
Xiao Zhiyu.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:34.320
Xiao Zhiyu.

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:23.440
Xiao Zhiyu.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.490
Are you alright?

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.590
Xiao Zhiyu.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Are you alright?

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:50.030
I'm fine.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:54.830
This must be the Dark Corridor
Sun just mentioned.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:57.200
It's pretty intimidating.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:00.320
I've taken some photos.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:00.960
Let's go.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:09.200
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:10.960
Of course not.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:13.880
Right.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:16.950
You were the one who saved me
back in Rongcheng.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.730
Don't walk so fast.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.180
Just admit it. You're afraid of the dark.
