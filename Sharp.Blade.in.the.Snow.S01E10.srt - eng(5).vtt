kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.060
Your Highness,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.040
that wretched girl
coughed up blood again today.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.300
She's extremely weak.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.730
I'm afraid she won't last much longer.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.600
But if she still refuses to hand over

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.800
the formula of Phoenix Incense by then,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.640
then we'll...

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.480
Who took it upon themselves

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.640
to replace the Red Plum
with Suoqingqiu rose today?

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.200
Your Highness, I...

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.880
In Mocheng,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.640
every blade of grass, every flower,
every life and every death

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.160
is mine to decide—

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.039
including

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.440
Feng Li.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.080
Understand?

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.400
An important guest has arrived.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.200
Your Highness,
you said there was a way to save her.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.860
Please grant me the medicine.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.600
Mr. Bai, you have always been
proud and untouchable,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.530
yet now you're willing to
bow your head for the Queen.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.330
But you didn't
bring the prescription today.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.480
Let alone an antidote,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.880
even…

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.560
Rao Jun.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.520
This medicine

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.420
can suppress the heart meridian
for three days.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.079
However,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.960
where is what I asked for?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.200
Mr. Bai, you should know—

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.520
once you and the Queen
are separated by life and death,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.579
there will be no chance to meet again.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.520
So,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.720
a formula in exchange for medicine.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.240
Mr. Bai,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.980
that's a fair deal.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.640
After all, I am Li's aunt by birth.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.240
How could I

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.040
truly bear to take her life?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.800
She killed her father as a child,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.640
and now lives in arrogance and indulgence.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.560
Countless eyes are waiting for her death.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.460
An aunt is a kind of mother as well.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.000
As her mother,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.560
I'm protecting her.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.480
Do you understand

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.280
my intentions?

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.380
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.360
This wine

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.600
is called Phoenix Drunk—

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.240
the best cure for sorrow.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.380
Since you love her to the core,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.480
I'll arrange things for you.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.040
It's far better than letting her

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.560
keep getting entangled with those slaves.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.480
May you two be bound for life,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.480
and share intimate moments.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.460
That day, Jiang Zimo said
he had found a lead.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.490
Now there's been no word at all—

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.920
something must have gone wrong.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.240
Your Majesty,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.440
try these pastries I just made.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.520
I added locust flower honey;

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.850
it's good for the lungs.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.200
Bai,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.930
have you heard anything about Jiang Zimo?

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.440
What could be more important
than your health?

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.930
At least have a few bites first.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.090
Your cooking skills

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.080
are better than the royal chefs.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.450
I'm glad you like it.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.560
Wait.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.560
Your Majesty,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.580
please take care of yourself.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.380
One or two sips won't hurt.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.850
This wine is called Phoenix Drunk.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.400
May you two be bound for life,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.880
and share intimate moments.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.840
Bai Yu, oh Bai Yu,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.740
you're truly despicable.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.600
How could you betray Li's trust?

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.440
No.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.690
I mustn't do something so foolish.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.860
The doctor has said

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.800
your condition isn't suited for alcohol.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.660
You really shouldn't drink this.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.060
Why are you being so stingy today?

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.530
You won't even spare me a single flask?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.659
I want it—and I'm drinking it.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.840
Your Majesty!

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.920
Your Majesty!

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.000
Your Majesty!

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.240
Your Majesty!

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.280
Your Majesty!

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.920
Bai is from a noble family.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.730
He's never known hardship.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.800
He's kind, pure,

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.920
and utterly sincere to me.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.010
If I drag him into danger because of me…

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.780
I don't know if that's right or wrong.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.360
Give it to me.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.360
You dare defy the Princess Royal's orders

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.520
and approach me.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.289
Do you have a death wish?

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.080
Your Majesty, you're drunk.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.120
I'm not drunk at all.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.080
You drink too.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.200
Your Majesty,

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.940
you really have a way of

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.640
keeping me worried sick.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.640
Let me get you some water.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.640
Don't go.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.620
It seems you're

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.520
still drawn to my warmth.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.880
There's a chill

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.720
in the air in Mocheng.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:06.960
Your Majesty,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.040
you're drunk.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.720
Why are you avoiding me?

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.930
Your Majesty, you seem like

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.040
a different person today.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.130
Something's wrong.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.040
This smell...

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.280
There's something wrong with the wine.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.080
I know you're all the same kind.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.480
You want to use me up

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.440
and then discard me like a chess piece.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.120
I must make the first move.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.050
Are you sure you want to be so cruel?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.360
Enough talk,

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.000
you miserable Stone.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.840
Even you dare to abandon me?

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.100
I'm going to punish you properly.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.090
You remember me now?

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.520
Feng Li,

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.800
who am I?

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.120
Stone.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.840
Hold me again.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.280
Please don't leave me again.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.040
I won't.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.840
If you wake up

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.130
and can still smile at me like this…

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.680
Look at you—a useless heap of flesh.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.400
You're not even worthy to
be the lowest blood slave.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.320
I wouldn't even bother to draw your blood.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.240
You'd stain my pool.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.380
You're nothing but Meng Wu's lackey.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.680
You don't deserve to shout here.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.360
You wretch!

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.700
How dare you speak of
the Princess Royal's name?

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.440
I'll drain you slowly.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.200
I'll make sure you neither live nor die.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.240
And you will watch with your own eyes

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.920
as the mistress you serve so faithfully

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.160
dies by my hand.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.360
My lord,

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.560
only the living can
provide warm and nourishing blood.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.840
If you keep beating him like this,

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.640
he may not survive.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.920
Silence.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.770
You little fool.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.380
You actually tried to
steel your courage

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.850
by tricking me into
drinking Phoenix Drunk with you.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.040
Since you've recognized me,

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.700
I won't hide from you anymore.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.680
You're awake.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.680
Last night...

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.880
Li,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.240
I...

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.280
How dare you do that to me?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.200
Shouldn't I be the one

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.920
saying that?

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.290
Last night, you held me so tightly.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.400
And now you wake up

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.650
and pretend that nothing happened?

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.040
Yesterday, you kept...

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:02.840
Shut up!

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.120
If I hadn't been drunk,

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.170
I would never have mistaken you
for someone else.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.560
Mistaken me?

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.810
You thought I was someone else?

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.800
This whole flask

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.400
would never be enough
to get me drunk on a normal day.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.200
So how did last night turn out like that?

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.000
So,

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.080
you mistook me for Stone?

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:22.960
Shut up!

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.640
You're not worthy to speak his name.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.940
So last night really
was nothing but a dream.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.050
Yun Zhan,

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.940
you deceived the sovereign's heart.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.300
You deserve death!

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.320
Last night, we drank
this Phoenix Drunk together.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.800
At the height of our closeness,

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.800
you called me by another man's name.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.000
Was that

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.540
your careful test, Your Majesty?

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.060
Were you trying to
turn me into his replacement?

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.960
Have you said enough?

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.490
What are you even talking about?
That's impossible.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.600
Your words

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.480
truly break my heart.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.140
But that man

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.400
does deserve to die.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.660
If you truly know nothing of this,

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.480
then perhaps you should think carefully

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.480
about who gave you

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.880
that wine.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:34.960
Wait.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.140
The doctor has said

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.040
your condition isn't suited for alcohol.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:40.770
You'd better

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.970
not drink this wine.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.520
I've always been indulgent and reckless.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.560
You know that.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.040
I only favored you a little more

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.920
because you resemble someone from my past.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.250
Aren't you afraid of me?

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.920
Your motives

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.080
don't interest me.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.320
You'll reveal it when you're ready.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.520
What we have is nothing more than an act.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.920
We each take what we need.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.840
A word of advice.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.080
Don't get too caught up in it.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.680
Did you really not recognize me at all?
