00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.640
Actually...

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.110
(Episode 23)

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.780
I just learned a secret about my birth.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.880
A secret about your birth?

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.480
I...

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.290
went my whole life without ever thinking
I wasn't my father's daughter.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.090
It turns out I'm not his real daughter.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.200
Still, my dad paid Mom's hospital bills
after her accident...

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.600
and went through a lot to raise me.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.440
I can't go. It wouldn't be right.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.540
You've seen my mom, ma'am, so you know.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.710
My mom used to be so brilliant,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.150
but an accident left her like this.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.080
The person who did that to my mother.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.690
I'm going to catch them
with my own two hands.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.260
Once I find them, I'll learn why and how
they did this to her.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.060
I'm going to uncover the whole truth.
And I'm going to make them pay for it.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.070
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.510
Jang Mi's gone. I don't see Jang Mi.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.180
Suk Hee, are you looking for Jang Mi?
She probably stepped out for a bit, okay?

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.120
- Don't worry, all right?
- Suk Hee wants to cry.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.520
Jang Mi's gone.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.690
She'll be back soon, okay?

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.220
Where did she go?

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.960
Of course. You have to.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.670
But do you have any concrete evidence
to catch them?

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.470
I don't have evidence,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.740
- but I do have a witness.
- A witness?

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.380
The one who gave the dashcam video?

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.380
Yes. Now that we have a witness,
we should be able to catch them soon.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.920
I'm going to prove that bad people
always get what's coming to them.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.120
That's what makes the world a just place.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.450
Absolutely. That's how it should be.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.990
There are just too many bad people
in the world.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.630
But that's a job for the police to handle.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.430
Are you really giving up your chance
to study abroad...

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.470
just to catch those bad guys?

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.700
There is that,

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.370
but I have to take care of my mom.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.640
After everything my dad has been through,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.350
I can't just go off and do something
for myself.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.780
What a shame.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.190
Come on, you should reconsider.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.030
Hey, watch your driving!

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.460
Are you trying to kill someone?

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.530
Hello, Detective. Any good news?

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.770
Really?

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.310
You found out who the guy with the scar
from the dashcam footage is?

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.180
If you're really thinking about
your father,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.340
that's all the more reason
to study abroad.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.180
Think about the long run.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.180
Is helping at the side dish shop
right now...

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.250
really what's best for your dad?

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.920
If you go abroad,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.260
and become a world-famous chef,
that's how you can truly repay him.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.160
Then you'll be able to give your dad
everything you couldn't before.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.030
But still...

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.740
- Go on, take it.
- I'm sorry.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.380
What is it?
Lawyer Kang, I'm busy right now.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.750
Hey, wait a second, Jang Mi.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.520
It's about that guy.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.050
- We found out who he is.
- What guy?

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.460
You mean the guy with the scar
who tore down our banner?

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.590
You found out who he is? Who is he?

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.390
The detective identified him.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.000
He has seven prior convictions.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.530
Seven priors? So he's a total gangster.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.870
Then if they know who he is,
they should get him soon, right?

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.610
- Probably.
- Okay. I'm heading to the station now.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.140
- You're coming too, right? See you there.
- Hey, Jang Mi, wait!

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.820
Gosh, I could've given her a ride
and we could've gone together.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.620
What's going on?

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.220
There's a gangster
who tore down our banner secretly.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.690
The police found out who he is.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.600
They did?

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.770
I'm so sorry, ma'am,
but I need to go to the police station.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.200
You're leaving right now?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.070
Yes, the detective just called,
so I'm heading over.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.440
It's only a matter of time
before the bad people get caught.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.280
When I get my hands on them, I'll rip
every single hair from their heads.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.650
The jerks who did this to my mom
and made my dad suffer so much.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.550
Once we catch them, we'll find out
why my mom had that accident,

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.550
and we'll finally be able
to solve this whole mystery.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.990
When they're caught, I'll make sure
they pay for what they did.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.460
And I'm so sorry.
You gave me such a great opportunity.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.370
Stop by the shop later for side dishes.
I'll make sure you're taken care of.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.800
Thanks for everything.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.340
I'll be going.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.420
You said it would be fine.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.120
- What?
- You said that there's no evidence...

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.390
and we'd be fine!

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.730
Tail Oh Jang Mi right now.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.130
They've identified your goon, Ssangkal,
from the dashcam footage.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.530
Oh Jang Mi is gleefully on her way
to the police station.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:30.540
Take care of it.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.640
- The police station?
- The police have identified Ssangkal.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.680
Tell him to lay low.
If he gets caught, it's all over. Hurry!

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.120
Darn it, nothing is going my way! Nothing!

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.720
Oh Jang Mi.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.830
You must have a death wish.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.760
If you'd just gone to study abroad,

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.030
I wouldn't have to
get any more blood on my hands.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.840
Why won't you listen to me?

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.150
Hey, Jang Mi. I was actually
just about to call...

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.350
Lawyer Kang, a case just broke
and I'm heading out, so don't come over.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.220
Okay, Detective. Understood.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.360
In that case, I'll stop by tomorrow.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.930
But Jang Mi must have already left.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.070
(Yoon I An, Managing Director,
Global Private Equity Fund)

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.770
(Ryu Hae Jun, CEO and doctor
at a digital healthcare firm)

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.000
Chairman. I've compiled a list
of potential suitors for Seo Rin.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:41.970
What do you think?

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.580
They're from good families, have MBAs,
and are tall and handsome.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.780
- They've got it all.
- Well, not bad.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.320
If our Seo Rin marries a good man
and takes over the company,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.420
you'll be able to breathe
a sigh of relief.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.990
And then we could go on trips
and have some fun. Right?

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.800
If that were to happen,
I could finally relax.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.500
It'd be a huge weight off my shoulders.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.000
CEO Chae is so busy with her own work.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.970
She can't even think
about finding a match for Seo Rin.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.510
So I have no choice but to take matters
into my own hands.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.750
But...

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.720
Seo Rin is completely smitten
with that chef.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.850
Do you think she'll agree
to meet other men?

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.990
If the family forbids it,
she'll only want him more.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.260
How about we invite Chef Kang over
and just treat him with formal courtesy?

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.660
Meanwhile, we have her meet these men
with impressive backgrounds,

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.330
one by one, in a natural setting.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.070
- It's like playing both sides.
- Playing both sides?

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.010
- That's not a bad idea.
- Then I'll get right on it, Chairman.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:55.980
Oh my goodness.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.590
Mom! I thought you said you'd set up
Chef Kang and Ma Seo Rin.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.590
Then what were all those photos
of other guys for?

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.590
Their resumes looked incredible.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.060
If you don't get it, just stay out of it.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.190
Can't you see
this is all to lay the groundwork for you?

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.460
To lay the groundwork for me?

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.070
Seo Rin is crazy about Chef Kang,
so even if we throw other men at her,

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:18.170
- do you think she'd meet them?
- Of course not.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.200
I wouldn't either.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:23.040
Exactly. Which means the men
in these photos...

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.240
are for you to meet.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.010
Oh my god!

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.210
I get to meet all of those men?

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.750
Of course, you silly girl.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.220
You need to find a good match
and get married, too.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.790
Why else do you think
I called it "playing both sides?"

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.230
Chef Kang and Seo Rin's relationship
hasn't even fully blossomed yet.

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:44.830
Imagine if the Chairman opposed it
right from the start.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.370
Chef Kang would get scared
and run for the hills.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.500
Then our grand ambition, Dream Group,

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.440
would slip right through our fingers,
wouldn't it?

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.070
Oh, you're right.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.180
If Seo Rin marries Chef Kang Jun Ho,
who comes from a modest background,

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.480
and I marry that man
from the world of politics and finance,

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.310
then the Chairman will hand the company
over to me.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.350
This is what they call
killing two birds with one stone.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.820
Having our cake and eating it too.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:10.860
Mom, you're a genius!

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.460
Oh, my beautiful daughter,
my princess Hong Ju!

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.360
It's about that guy.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.460
We found out who he is.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.460
Okay. I'm heading to the station now.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.080
Oh Jang Mi,

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.320
you'll never uncover the truth.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.520
I won't let you.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.800
Hey, are you drunk driving?
Who races through an alley like that?

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.400
- Jang Mi, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.510
That really scared me.
A car just came out of nowhere...

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.680
I bet anything that was a drunk driver.
Why else would they flee a near miss?

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.420
If it weren't for you,
I would have been hit for sure.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.150
Thank you.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:23.150
So, you're grateful?

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.220
You should be.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.360
But you always try to get by
with just words.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.030
I was grateful,
but then you had to go and run your mouth.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.370
And just like that,
I don't feel so grateful anymore.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.640
Come on, I'll walk you home.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.770
Lawyer Kang.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.140
You should just head home.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.510
This is my family's problem.
I can handle the police station myself.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.080
Right. I'm sure you've got it covered.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.920
I appreciate you stepping in to help,

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.150
but I have to handle my own affairs.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.760
You don't have to go to the station
today anyway.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.060
- What?
- The detective called as I was leaving.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.930
Everyone was called for backup for a case.
He said to come in tomorrow.

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:12.500
You'll just have to wait one more day.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.470
It's late, so let's get you home.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.110
Are you offering to take me home?

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.640
No, that's all right.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.680
I can get home by myself.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.250
Can we please just go?
You almost got killed just now.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.620
Come on.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.620
Quickly, come on.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.890
Okay, just let go of me.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:38.960
I really am grateful.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.530
How grateful are you?

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:43.830
How am I supposed to put that into words?

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.370
- You have to tell me for me to know.
- I'm very grateful, okay?

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.570
Say "Thank you" three times.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:50.880
You're unbelievable.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.280
Thank you.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.430
Wait, I thought you were coming from home.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.600
Why were you coming from that direction
just now?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.570
I met with CEO Chae.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.370
What?

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.610
I've decided not to study abroad.
I went to tell her that.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.310
You're not going to study abroad?

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.780
Why not?
It seems like such a good opportunity.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.820
Just because.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.990
My dad...

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.990
All this time,
he's been looking after me and my mom.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.560
He's sacrificed so much.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.970
How can I just...

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.440
leave everything to him
just to save myself?

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.210
A person has to have some decency.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.140
Your father must be so disappointed.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.510
I'm sure he just wants
what's best for you.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.920
Still, I'm kind of glad.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.590
Now I can keep bickering with you
every day.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.730
- What was that?
- I'm kidding.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.160
I take it back.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.800
I'll get going.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:22.600
About earlier...

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.070
Thanks for helping me out.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.970
The lawyer helping Oh Jang Mi
is Kang Baek Ho.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.970
He's Professor Kang's son.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.570
She went home today
instead of the police station.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.450
What am I going to do?

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.820
I can't just let Oh Jang Mi
run around freely.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.720
What if Father or Hong Ju sees her?

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.490
No, what if Seo Rin...

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.190
The day Oh Jang Mi runs into Seo Rin,
it's all over.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.730
I must convince Jang Mi to study abroad,
no matter what.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:29.400
Or else,
I'll have no choice but to get rid of her.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.900
Oh Jang Mi, it's all up to you in the end.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.920
Honey, it looks like you drank again.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.330
Why are you drinking every single day?

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.860
I don't know. It just happened.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.830
- Here, eat something sweet.
- What?

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:03.830
- Here.
- Okay.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.840
You're ruining your health.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.870
- Thanks.
- I'm home.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.040
- Hey.
- Strawberries.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.340
- I want some too.
- All right, for our baby boy, too.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.210
Come on, really.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.350
You seem to be in a good mood lately.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.090
- Are you dating someone, son?
- No.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.520
Then is there someone you like?

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:25.960
Maybe?

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.530
I'm not really sure myself.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.670
Hey, have some more before you go.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.240
I only picked men
with amazing credentials,

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:41.410
so you need to get ready
to go on blind dates.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.410
Mom, aren't you jumping the gun?

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.080
It's my turn only
after Seo Rin turns them down.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.550
How can I start going on dates right now?

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.220
Besides, Mom, what's the point?

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.950
Do you think guys with perfect resumes
would like me?

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.390
How would you even introduce me?

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:04.400
As the Chairman's future daughter?
Or as the freeloader in their house,

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:06.260
just walking on eggshells around CEO Chae?

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.670
You know, now that you mention it,
that is a problem.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.470
That old man. I swear I ought to...

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:15.910
What? What are you going to do?

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.610
I'm going to finish this once and for all.
I can't take this anymore.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.450
What is the meaning of this?

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.120
- Chairman.
- Let go! What's gotten into you?

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.890
Where are your manners?

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.860
I was going to handle it properly
when the time came,

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.260
and welcome you with respect.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.070
Chairman...

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.480
Oh my goodness.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:37.620
You tramp!

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.220
Chae Hwa Young!

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.960
I took you in off the street,
and it turns out you have no shame.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.700
What was that for?
What did I do to deserve you hitting me?

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.970
You've done nothing wrong?

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.440
Sneaking into Father's room as he slept
to make a move on him,

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:52.970
and you call that nothing?

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.610
Like it or not,
the Chairman and I are inseparable.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.910
Do you think I'll forget this humiliation
once I marry him?

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.650
You should think about your own future.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.120
Look at you,
still running that mouth of yours.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.550
Let go of me!

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.290
- Oh, no...
- Over my dead body!

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:15.430
I’ll never accept you
as my mother-in-law. So get real.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.430
And don't you dare use your daughter
to pull another stunt...

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.030
and have Kang Jun Ho over.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.170
I won't let it slide next time.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.570
This is your one and only warning.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.700
Understand?

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.440
Mark my words.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.580
Inviting Kang Jun Ho was
all your daughter Ma Seo Rin's idea.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.380
Get your facts straight
before you say another word.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.150
Stop trying to pin the blame
on my daughter.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:39.950
I bet you and Hong Ju...

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.920
are desperate for Seo Rin
to marry Kang Jun Ho.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.520
But you can forget about that.
Even if Seo Rin were to get married,

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.290
do you really think
she'd leave this house?

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:54.730
Seo Rin is the Chairman's one
and only blood relative.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.200
And you know what that means?
It means Dream Group...

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.740
will be inherited by Ma Seo Rin. Get it?

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.210
So don't even think about
getting your greedy hands on it.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.390
Mom?

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.390
Who did this to you?

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.130
- Tell me. Is that CEO Chae?
- Hong Ju.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.830
Listen, no matter what it takes,
you have to take over Dream Group.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.400
It's my only wish.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.740
I will make her pay for this humiliation.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.380
Mom.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.150
I feel terrible for Dad,

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.960
but who's my real father?

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.490
Tell me.

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.970
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:12.110
Jang Mi, come on. It's time to eat.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.210
Okay.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:15.650
All right.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.880
I'm not going to the US.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.280
What? Why not?

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.520
Of course, you shouldn't go.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.750
You’d have to be crazy to go there
after hearing that.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.620
- Stop it, Tae Sook.
- I knew you wouldn't go...

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.020
after I told you that.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:31.130
- But don't you hold it against me.
- Tae Sook, that's enough.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.930
Jang Mi's leaving.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.230
If Jang Mi leaves, Suk Hee will be sad.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.600
No, Mom. I'm not going.
I'm going to stay right here with you.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:45.510
Jang Mi isn't leaving.
Jang Mi is staying with Suk Hee.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.910
I love my Jang Mi.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.780
Jang Mi. We need to talk.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.430
It's over.

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:05.360
I already met with CEO Chae
and told her I'm not going.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:09.870
- Jang Mi, are you serious?
- I told you already. I'm not going.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.600
Why won't you go?
Why pass up such a great opportunity?

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.010
You know why, so why are you asking?

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.440
Is this because I'm not your real father?

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.580
Is it because you don't think
I can take care of your mom?

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.450
That's not it at all.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.610
If I have any conscience at all,

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.450
how could I possibly leave Mom with you
and go?

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.090
It's not like you'd be leaving for good.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.890
Are you never going to get married?

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.390
- Will you be tied to your mom forever?
- Stop it, Dad.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.760
From now on, my goal is to find the people
who did this to my mom.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.330
I'm heading out.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:44.970
Jang Mi.

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.870
Get out of my head, Oh Jang Mi!

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.710
I just keep thinking about her.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.140
Why am I thinking about
Oh Jang Mi all day?

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.520
But I wonder if Jang Mi
is really going to be okay.

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.320
She'd been dreaming of that cooking school
in the US for so long.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.020
Do you know what my dream is?

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:38.660
To join Chang Restaurant,

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.530
learn as an apprentice
under Chef Kang Jun Ho,

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.560
and become a three-star Michelin chef.
That was my dream.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.730
Should I talk to my brother about it?

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.200
If she could get a job
at Chang Restaurant,

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.870
she'd at least be able to
live out some of her dream.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.370
Baek Ho, the meal is ready!

00:23:58.780 --> 00:23:59.780
Here you go.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.180
I know it might not be up
to our celebrity chef's standards,

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.250
but just eat up for your mom's sake, son.

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.420
Okay, Mom. That's enough.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.920
And Mom, it suits my tastes just fine,
so don't worry.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.660
You made this?
I thought the housekeeper made it.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.060
Hey! Don't embarrass your mother.
Just drop it.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:18.330
It's fine, honey.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.500
As long as you're on my side, I'm happy.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.970
Enjoy your meal, my king. Here you go.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.840
Thank you, my queen. I will enjoy it.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:33.340
Hey, Jun Ho...

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:35.910
What is it?

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:39.620
Never mind. Forget it.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.820
What's with you, Baek Ho?

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.650
Don't start something and not finish.
What is it?

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.930
Jang Mi said you were her first love
and her idol.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.170
But I really hate the thought
of her being with you.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.930
That reminds me.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.940
You said there was someone
who wanted a job at my restaurant?

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.010
Jang Mi? What about her?

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:05.710
Is that her name? Jang Mi?

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.580
Tell her to bring her resume
by the restaurant.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.450
- What?
- Her injured hand is better now, right?

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.350
Well, I guess so, but...

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.790
Why? Did she find another job?

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:18.190
No, that's not it.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.690
Okay, fine. I'll talk to her.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:24.860
Why are you suddenly bringing this up now?

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:28.270
Hey, you're the one who injured her hand,
weren't you?

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:31.270
Yes, I was.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.140
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.080
You're leaving right now?

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.080
Yes, the detective just called,
so I'm heading over.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.280
It's only a matter of time
before the bad people get caught.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.990
When I get my hands on them, I'll rip
every single hair from their heads.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.260
The jerks who did this to my mom
and made my dad suffer so much.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:58.060
Once we catch them, we'll find out
why my mom had that accident,

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:01.160
and we'll finally be able
to solve this whole mystery.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.530
When they're caught, I'll make sure
they pay for what they did.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.870
Go ahead. Try your best.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.680
All bark and no bite.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.350
Manager Lee, come in.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.690
What's the deal with your lackey?

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:27.420
I heard the police identified him.
You need to put a stop to this.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.160
(Lawyer Kang Baek Ho)

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:36.370
What should I do?

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.240
For Jang Mi's dream,

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.270
introducing her to my brother
is the right thing to do.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:43.740
But my heart...

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.910
is screaming at me not to let her go.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.550
Come on, what am I going to do?

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.690
Yes, Detective.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:26:59.120
I'm back.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.260
What?

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.400
Jang Mi, where are you?
Get over to the police station now.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:12.400
The police can't do anything
with just that video.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.400
But your lackey has been identified.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.640
It's bound to be traced back to you,
isn't it?

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.780
He's tight-lipped.
You don't need to worry.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.880
No matter what,
this won't blow back on you, ma'am.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.020
And what about the witness
who has the dashcam footage?

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.950
Don't you worry. It's been handled.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.720
This is such a headache.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.220
Why is everything blowing up at once?

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:39.060
Don't let your lackey get caught.
Understood?

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:40.130
Yes, ma'am.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.600
As soon as this whole thing dies down,

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:45.870
I'll take care of Oh Jang Mi myself.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.990
(Public Release of Suspect Information)

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.700
(Detective Unit Two)

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:29.810
(Name: Park Soon Sun)

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.230
(The First Man)

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.070
If we catch this man, we'll finally solve
the mystery of what happened to my mom.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:56.240
Which means there's someone
powerful backing him up.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.710
Chef Kang Jun Ho from Chang Restaurant
wants to interview you.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.780
So you're saying Chef Kang Jun Ho
wants to meet me, is that it?

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.320
- Her name is Jang Mi?
- It's a pretty name, right?

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:06.750
Do you like her?

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.890
Just imagine Chef Kang Jun Ho
meeting Oh Jang Mi.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.060
She's a dead ringer for Seo Rin!

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.060
We have to do something to stop this.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:17.330
