(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.090
Gosh, you're kicking up so much dust.
Go do that inside.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.330
Come on. I'm about to go grocery shopping.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.800
I can't go until Jang Mi gets here.
She knows what to get.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.000
But speaking of Jang Mi,
has she mentioned anything?

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.640
- About what?
- Doesn't she ever ask who her dad is?

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.140
Hey, how come you two
are coming in together?

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.110
We went to the police station
and found out who took down our banner.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.680
Really? Who is it?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.480
- This is the guy.
- Let me see.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.820
- Gosh, this guy looks like bad news.
- He was an enforcer for the Viper Gang.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.990
Apparently, the gang disbanded,
and the members all scattered.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.160
So you're saying this is the guy
who tried to harm Suk Hee?

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.260
We're not sure. But if we catch this man,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.870
we'll finally solve the mystery
of what happened to my mom.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.640
Catching him has to be
our top priority, then.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.970
But even after that,

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.840
someone kept stopping you
from putting the banner back up, right?

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.280
That's right. Even the county office...

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.250
didn’t let us hang it when we applied
for a banner permit.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.050
That means there's someone powerful...

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.890
backing him up.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.160
Yes, that could be it.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.260
Someone who can control the Viper Gang
or people like them.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.630
A powerful person has to be involved.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.400
(Public Release of Suspect Information,
Name: Park Soon Sun)

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.550
Where did Mrs. Yeom go?

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.180
She's in her room.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.570
I'm coming in.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.710
Mrs. Yeom.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.920
Are you crying?

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.990
Are you crying?

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.250
I'm a woman too, you know.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.820
After being humiliated like that by you,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.090
how can I ever show my face again?

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.130
I'm so mortified someone will find out.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.340
- Mrs. Yeom.
- I don't even want to live anymore.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.840
I've lived my life
completely devoted to you.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.350
Look, I...

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.350
I didn't really mean it.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.820
But after you rejected me so cruelly,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.820
I just wonder
what the point of living is...

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.660
in this world full of sorrow.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.400
It really hurt you that much.
I'm so sorry.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.500
Chairman.
Why did you push me away so forcefully?

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.840
Oh, for goodness' sake.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.310
As you know, Mrs. Yeom,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.410
it's been a long time
since I've had a woman by my side.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.750
I've been a bachelor for so long,
so I just panicked.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.320
So that means...

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.560
you don't find me repulsive, right?

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.090
Goodness. Repulsive? Of course not.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.260
It's not lonely at all having you here.
In fact, I like it.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.430
Chairman.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.770
You hold my very life
in your hands, Chairman.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.940
My very life is in your hands.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.110
Gosh, you're always so dramatic.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.920
What a sly fox.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.450
I wonder what tricks she's pulling
to wrap the Chairman around her finger.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.720
We're both in the same boat,
just servants waiting on our master.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.700
If she thinks she can run this house
and start ordering me around,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.200
she'll have another thing coming.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.270
Mrs. Yang.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.670
The Chairman and I are going out,
so clean his room until it's spotless.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.480
And make that spicy croaker stew
the Chairman likes.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.450
- No, I was thinking we could eat out.
- Let's go, Chairman.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.620
- Have a good time, Chairman.
- Carry on.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.790
Gosh, as soon as I said that,
she's ordering me around.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.400
The person you're calling is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.700
What? The witness isn't picking up?

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.170
That's weird.
I still can't get a hold of him.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.070
But he was so willing to cooperate.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.110
Someone must have gotten to him first.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.480
You're right.
The power behind this must have acted.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.810
That means someone knows our every move.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.920
Did you notice anyone suspicious around?

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.820
By the way, Jang Mi.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.860
This is completely unrelated, though.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.390
Yes?

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.470
And I got to see Chef Kang Jun Ho today,
whom I'm a huge fan of.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.570
No, never mind.
I can't tell you. Just forget it.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.940
- What is it?
- Anyway,

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.910
- I need to think about it more.
- About what?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.480
It's nothing.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.810
- Goodness.
- What? You're still here?

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.850
Do you want to get cozy
and peel some potatoes?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.750
- Me?
- Jang Mi.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.120
Let's talk for a minute.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.560
Jang Mi, you're going to get hurt
if you keep dealing with thugs like this.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.960
Please stop.
It would kill me if you got hurt.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.570
Dad, why would I get hurt?

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.800
I'll be fine, so don't worry.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.040
Why won't you ever listen to me?

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.210
I'll find the people who did this
to your mom,

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.810
so you just go study abroad.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.940
What happened to Mom concerns me too.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.380
So don't even try to talk me out of it.
All right? I've already made up my mind.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.590
So you're going to give up studying abroad
and settle for this?

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.320
This kind of opportunity
doesn't come around every day.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.290
Do you think you can just go
whenever you feel like it?

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.560
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.300
What?

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.570
Chef Kang Jun Ho from Chang Restaurant
wants to interview Jang Mi?

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.640
Gosh, looks like Jang Mi
is finally getting her wish.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.110
Hey, but how do you know that chef?

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.040
The thing is...

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.920
He's my brother. My actual brother.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.650
What? Hey! Why have you been hiding that
this whole time?

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.220
I wasn't hiding it. It just never came up.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.790
Please don't tell Jang Mi
that he's my brother.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:36.990
You're something else.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.760
You tell Jang Mi about
the interview yourself.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.530
Come on, you do it.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.870
And also,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.570
speaking of which...

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.740
The one who injured Jang Mi's hand...

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.310
was me.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:51.710
What was that?

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.210
Come here, honey.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.130
What do you think you're doing?

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.400
Sorry.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.970
You're the one who hurt Jang Mi's hand?

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.500
Get over here! Come here, you punk!

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.000
- I'm sorry, Tae Pyung!
- You punk!

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.140
What else haven't you told me? Anything?

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.310
Let me go!

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.610
Let's try drawing it in blue.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.680
What?

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.280
You want me to go where?

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.420
Chef Kang Jun Ho from Chang Restaurant
wants to interview you.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.620
- Me? For real?
- That's right.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.060
Take your resume to Chang Restaurant
by 10 a.m. tomorrow.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.760
Gosh! You're not kidding, right?

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.560
So the great Chef Kang Jun Ho himself
said he wants to see me?

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.900
Yes, you dork. Are you that happy?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.700
Of course I'm happy.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.870
He was my first love.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:50.940
He's the best guy ever,

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.570
and he's the chef I admire and look up to
more than anyone.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.510
I'm glad. I'm so relieved
you'll finally be able to work there.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.280
- But how do you know Chef Kang Jun Ho?
- What?

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.790
It's not so much that I know him, but...

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.130
How did you find out about it to tell me?

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.700
Gosh, you drew that so well. Is it a pig?

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.000
It's a bunny. Suk Hee is good at drawing.
I like Baek Ho.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.710
Oh, my! So it was CEO Chae.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.540
- What?
- CEO Chae Hwa Young told you, didn't she?

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.850
That must be it. She knows
that my dream is to be a chef.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.880
So that's why she told
Chef Kang Jun Ho about me.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.790
Yes, that's right. It was CEO Chae.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.920
I can't thank her enough.
How can I ever repay her?

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.030
I can't believe someone like her exists.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.890
She got you a gig,

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.460
and when I turned down the offer
to study abroad,

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.560
she even got me a job at the restaurant.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.500
Goodness.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.170
She sounds like an amazing person.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.200
Right. Tell me about it.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.370
You should go to the interview tomorrow.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.440
I have to repay CEO Chae's kindness.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.440
Tae Pyung, to show her how grateful I am,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.050
I'm going to work incredibly hard
if I get a job there.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.880
Thank you so much, Tae Pyung.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.150
Sure.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.750
Goodness.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.250
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

Dream Hotel’s Food and Beverage
budget proposal for next month...

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:30.700
has a problem.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.740
Do it again.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.140
- Pardon? What kind of problem?
- The budgets for the wedding hall...

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.110
and other Food and Beverage outlets
are the same,

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.210
so why was
only Chang Restaurant's budget increased?

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.110
- That's...
- Didn't you hear me?

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.210
I said, cut the budget drastically.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:48.020
The way Chef Kang Jun Ho
recklessly spends money on ingredients.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.150
Don't you think it's time
we finally reined that in?

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.790
But that would be a huge blow
to Chang Restaurant's image.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:58.100
We need to use fresh, high-end ingredients
to maintain its luxury image.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.970
Who couldn't make delicious food
by throwing that much money around?

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.700
A "luxury image?"

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.970
A skilled chef can make
any food luxurious, no matter the cost.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.040
That's what real skill is.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.580
Spending money like water
just because it isn't his.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.350
Why are you just standing there?

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.850
Get out and draw up
a proper budget right now.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.320
Yes, ma'am.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:23.920
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.100
Tell Chef Kang Jun Ho
to come to my office.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.650
Were you the one who proposed
a budget increase to Team Leader Jin?

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.150
Yes.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:51.450
Excuse me?

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.750
And you expect to be a chef,
spending money like that?

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.390
Are you aware that's a dead giveaway
of your lack of skill?

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.630
I take it you intend to cut the budget,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.300
but I'd appreciate it if you'd refrain
from the offensive personal attacks.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.030
I meant for them to be offensive.

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.000
And while we're at it,
there's one more thing.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:15.870
You're trying to seduce my Seo Rin,

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.380
scheming to get your foot
in the door at Dream.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.350
But I swear, over my dead body,

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.550
will you and Seo Rin ever be together.
You'd better understand that.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.990
Don't you dare take my words lightly.
Mark them well.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.430
Are you that threatened?

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:38.960
What?

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.700
I believe I've already said...

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.400
I have no feelings for your daughter.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:44.940
But are you...

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.410
worried that something might happen
between me and Director Ma Seo Rin?

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.610
- Is that why you're so terrified?
- Watch your mouth.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.250
If you continue to act this despicably,

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.410
then I might just have to...

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.350
- start pursuing Director Ma Seo Rin.
- Kang Jun Ho.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.720
Yes, CEO Chae?

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.460
Don't do anything you'll regret later.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.730
- I'll think about it.
- I've given you a clear warning.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.310
What gives him the right
to be so arrogant?

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.490
Jun Ho, where have you been?

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:40.930
Jun Ho, you heard, didn't you?

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.460
- About coming to my house this weekend.
- I have no reason to go,

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.260
- so just drop it.
- Why?

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:52.070
You've got it wrong.
I wasn't the one who invited you.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.270
Jin Hong Ju bugged my grandfather
until he invited you.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.510
- It was Team Leader Jin who invited you.
- I don't care who invited me.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:02.850
I'm not going.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.080
But my grandfather's the one
who invited you.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.350
You're going to turn him down?

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.510
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.040
Ha Neul.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.700
My son.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.140
Where are you?

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.210
When your mom is having such a hard time,

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.120
I wish you were here by my side
to give me strength.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.650
My son.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.360
Stop crying.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.130
What can I do?
We don't have any money, sweetie.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.670
We don't even have money for formula.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.210
- I'm sorry, boss.
- Hwa Young.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.580
Where are you?

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.350
- Why have you been so hard to reach?
- I'm sorry.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.650
I haven't been feeling well,

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.580
so I came out to the countryside
to rest up for a bit.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.920
Could you lend me some money?
I'm completely broke.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.290
Chae Hwa Young, you're saved.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.130
An offer came in for a soda commercial.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.630
If you shoot this ad,

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.530
- it's your ticket to stardom.
- What?

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.440
The shoot is next Monday,

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.210
so just get up here as fast as you can.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:44.610
Got it?

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.720
- All right, I'm taking the picture.
- Okay.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.620
Stay still.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.760
That's right.
If I just shoot this soda commercial,

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.730
I can become a breakout star.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.400
My struggles will finally be over,

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.000
but I can't let anything hold me back.

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.470
Once I make money,

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.210
my baby,

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.440
I'll come back for you then.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:22.950
Just wait a little longer.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.450
What a handsome baby.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.220
What's his name?

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.490
Ha Neul.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:37.900
It's Ha Neul.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:40.930
Ha Neul, look over here.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.400
Ha Neul, peekaboo!

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.110
Ha Neul, look over here.
Ha Neul, peekaboo!

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.010
Do you want me to get
a shot of you two together?

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.220
No, just make sure
you get a good one of Ha Neul.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.550
Sure.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.550
Ha Neul, look here.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.890
Ha Neul, look over here.
Ha Neul, peekaboo!

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.510
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.590
Maybe I shouldn't have told
Jang Mi about my brother.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.560
It's obvious she's going to get
the job at the restaurant.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.560
- Chef Kang Jun Ho?
- Yes.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.860
Even the way he walked was so cool.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.830
He was just like a model.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.900
A model? Not even remotely.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.710
He's more like
a cold, bitter iced Americano.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.010
Then again,
iced Americanos are seriously addictive.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.780
I shouldn't have said anything.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.490
(Lawyer Kang Baek Ho)

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.890
Jang Mi, it's me, Kang Baek Ho.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.760
Cheers.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.370
How can you be in the mood for a toast
at a time like this?

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.570
The detective said Ssangkal vanished
and has no idea where he is.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.640
But there's nothing we can do about that.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.670
There's no concrete evidence...

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.240
Ssangkal was the one
who took down the banner,

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.810
so the police can't even issue an APB.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.710
But does that mean
we can't even make a toast?

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.150
Especially when you're about to get
your dream job at that restaurant?

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.920
What does that have to do
with catching the culprit?

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.690
They're not related,

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.860
but achieving your dream is something
worth celebrating.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.630
You're not going to drink?

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.270
No, thanks. You go ahead
and drink up, Lawyer Kang.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.440
Always with the "lawyer."

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.370
It's really starting to get on my nerves.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.710
My name is Kang Baek Ho.
You could call me Baek Ho or something.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.680
Kang Baek Ho or Baek Ho.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.280
Or "brother."

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.310
Right. "Brother" sounds nice.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.080
Come on, try calling me something else.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.560
We're not advertising that I'm a lawyer.
Everyone around here thinks it's weird.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:22.560
All right.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.090
Baek Ho...

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.230
Brother Baek Ho.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.070
I like the sound of that.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:40.510
Maybe because I have no younger sister,
I really like hearing it.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.780
But are you sure you won't have any?
You've got to drink to build a tolerance.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.490
I have an important interview tomorrow,
so I'd better not.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.260
If I drink, my face might get puffy.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.530
She'd be pretty even if it was.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.630
You think one drink will make you
fail your interview?

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.430
Don't worry.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.200
Your interview is
at 10 a.m. tomorrow, right?

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.770
I'll be rooting for you.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.770
Your dream.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.910
I truly hope you achieve it.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.880
Of all the things you've said to me,

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.150
that's the nicest thing I've heard yet.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.000
I'm heading to bed.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.100
- I'm home.
- You're back?

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:41.170
You're home, son?

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:42.970
Hey, Jun Ho.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.140
Jun Ho, I'm sorry.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.350
Rumor has it
that the famous Chef Kang Jun Ho...

00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.920
is madly in love with his girlfriend.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:03.660
- Really?
- Yes.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.400
I hear they're getting married soon.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.570
So, there's no need to get your hopes up
over Chef Kang Jun Ho.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.440
What? You're ridiculous.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.970
Did you think Chef Kang
would not have a girlfriend?

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.680
Is that why you're sharing this?

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.640
And here I thought it was
something serious.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.980
Unbelievable.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.880
I made up a girlfriend
you don't even have, Jun Ho,

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.720
and it didn't even faze her.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.050
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:33.120
Nothing.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.090
Jang Mi has an interview tomorrow
at 10 a.m.

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:37.360
Go easy on her, will you?

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.860
What? That's lame.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.100
Is her name Jang Mi?

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.300
Yes, it's Oh Jang Mi.
Even her name is pretty, right?

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.040
Do you like her?

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.140
No.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.240
What? That's lame.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.050
Yes.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.650
I think I do like her.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:04.790
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:44.490
Should I wear it down?

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.970
The groundskeeper at the villa
said this was on the ground.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.180
He gave me this hairpin
and asked if it was your mom's.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.720
My mom's?

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:15.560
The Suk Hee I knew
was never one for jewelry.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.330
But then again, there must be a lot
about her that I never knew.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.840
Maybe it was from your birth father,
so I kept it safe.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.390
Goodness!

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.360
Jang Mi, you're so pretty.
My pretty Jang Mi.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.240
- I get my looks from you, Mom.
- Jang Mi is Suk Hee's daughter.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.300
Jang Mi is so pretty.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:02.610
Oh, right. Mom.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.180
Do you remember this hairpin?

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.550
Do you happen to remember
who gave it to you?

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.520
Suk Hee doesn't know.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.520
Maybe if you try it on...

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.490
No, I don't want it! It's not Suk Hee's.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:19.820
Suk Hee hates it!

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.460
- This is yours, Mom.
- No! It's not Suk Hee's.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.800
This is Suk Hee's. This one.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.810
What?

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.650
Oh Jang Mi
is going to have her interview...

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.150
with Chef Kang Jun Ho at Chang Restaurant?

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.680
- Yes.
- Did you just say "yes"?

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.920
How can you just stand there
like an idiot and say "yes"?

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.760
I just found out myself.
I wanted to report it to you first.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.330
- I'll take care of it immediately.
- Use your head! Think for one second!

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.730
Just imagine Chef Kang Jun Ho
meeting Oh Jang Mi.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:03.230
She's a dead ringer for Seo Rin!

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.500
On top of that,
what if Seo Rin and Oh Jang Mi meet?

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.440
What are we going to do
if those twins meet?

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.910
And that's not all.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.380
Imagine if Father sees Seo Rin
and Oh Jang Mi at the same time.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.820
It's a nightmare just thinking about it.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:21.820
What am I going to do?

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.750
It's only a matter of time...

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.190
before everyone finds out I stole a twin.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.740
The interview is at 10 a.m.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.980
She might have arrived already.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.520
Should I go and try to stop her now?

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.390
After all I did to keep her away
from this company...

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.120
Are you just going to stand by
and do nothing?

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.230
You have to do something to stop this.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.490
No. I have to stop this now.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:25.150
Okay, Oh Jang Mi. Just be yourself.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.580
Don't go overboard
just because it's Chef Kang Jun Ho.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:54.640
(The First Man)

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.110
What kind of amazing woman
has the great Kang Baek Ho so whipped?

00:27:58.450 --> 00:27:59.920
I should at least meet her before I judge.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.320
Today is the day
Chef Kang Jun Ho is coming to the house.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.860
I was just worried that Director Ma
might cause trouble.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.360
I wonder if something's wrong.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.230
- Did something happen to Assistant Chae?
- Gosh, you scared me!

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.400
I thought your assistant's name
was Kim Hyo Jung.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:21.970
