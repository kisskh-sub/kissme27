WEBVTT

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.519
I agree.

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:44.719
I agree.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.239
Come on, come on.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.680
Eat up, eat up.

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:59.879
Today was a total mess.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.840
What happened?

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.400
I heard people died, is that right?

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.719
The Coastal Defense Unit...

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:06.959
lost a lot of people.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.599
Even the Commander went there personally.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:11.719
Wait for Ju'er to come back.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.120
Ju'er will tell you herself when she gets back.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.599
Translator Luo...

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:16.960
About last time...

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.840
the matter I mentioned to you...

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.319
how is your inquiry going?

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.360
The Commander did receive a...

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.400
report from the Police Unit on lifting the sea ban.

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.639
But...

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.719
he put it in the safe.

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:30.919
I can't see it.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.319
The time is almost up.

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:37.400
Tell me, for the people on this island...

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.159
is it better to go out or not?

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.120
I think you worry too much.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.400
Lifting the sea ban is a good thing.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.919
As for you...

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.159
just mobilize everyone to go to sea as normal.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:48.800
Why don't you find a chance...

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.240
to take a look at that report?

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.360
It's not that I won't look.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.400
Let's not even mention...

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.639
if the Commander finds out about this,

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:56.680
I'll lose my head.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.240
Let's just say...

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.000
if I could see it...

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.960
since you asked...

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.039
would I refuse to look? Right?

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.919
Drink up.

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.000
Let's not talk about it now, drink.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.680
Come on, come on.

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.159
Ju'er.

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.400
Is the Major okay at the hospital?

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.280
Nothing went wrong, did it?

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.759
That Oshima Hiroshi came by once.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.719
It was a close call, but we're safe.

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.840
I was so scared my legs went weak.

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.120
I didn't expect...

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.599
you performed quite well.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.159
Brother Longxia.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.280
You rarely praise me.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.639
Alright.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.479
I'll praise you more often from now on.

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.400
Brother Longxia.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.520
I feel...

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.560
you've been treating me better and better lately.

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:56.680
I don't know...

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.800
if it's because...

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.080
of the things I did for you and Ying'er.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.360
Do you remember?

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.639
You, me, and Ying'er.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.879
When we were little...

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.040
we played every day.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.600
Playing house.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.360
Have a chubby baby next year.

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:25.399
Kneel down.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.279
First bow to Heaven and Earth.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.639
Second bow... second bow to what again?

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.839
Forget it, husband and wife bow to each other.

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:37.360
Playing house.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.319
Have a chubby baby next year.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.480
Carrying the bride, playing house.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.399
Have a chubby baby next year.

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:52.160
Give it to me.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.360
Let go.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.720
Let go of me.

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:55.839
Ying'er.

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:56.519
Let go.

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:56.959
Give it to me.

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:57.600
Stop it.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:58.800
I'm counting to three.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.319
One, two...

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:01.560
Look, what's that?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.519
What is that?

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:03.480
Look.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.800
Look over there.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.160
I remember.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.480
Childhood was so good.

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:11.360
Carefree every day.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.480
Only knowing how to play games.

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:17.519
For me...

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.920
that wasn't just a game.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.879
Since I was little...

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.720
I decided...

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.560
I wouldn't marry anyone but you.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.319
I, Tang Ju'er, belong to you, Ye Longxia.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.759
I'll go wherever you go.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.319
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.279
I won't regret it even if I die.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.959
Actually, what I worry about most

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.079
is that silly girl, Ju'er.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.279
She's too honest,

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:22.839
and doesn't know how to protect herself.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.879
And I'm just a bag of old bones,

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.720
so I can't protect her either.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.079
Although

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.560
she works in the Japanese hospital,

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:34.480
the Japanese don't like her.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.319
And the Chinese on the island

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.600
are always gossiping behind her back.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.199
You know, for a young unmarried woman...

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:41.800
I think

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:44.279
we should just live our own peaceful lives.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:45.879
Why care what others say?

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.399
Right?

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:49.720
But,

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.720
I've seen Ju'er a few times

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.480
together with the Ye family's young master.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.759
You mean that Ye Longxia?

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:01.360
It's like this.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.399
I...

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:03.959
arrived on the island quite late,

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:05.319
so there are some situations

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:06.519
I'm not very familiar with.

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:08.120
I recently heard

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.000
Ju'er has a betrothal engagement with Ye Longxia.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.279
Oh, don't even mention the Ye family.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.240
Regarding this matter,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.000
I never agreed to it at all.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.240
The Ye family...

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.199
never gave any betrothal gifts.

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:31.920
They just exchanged birth horoscopes.

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:33.600
As soon as the Japanese landed on the island,

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:34.920
that Ye Degong

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.959
just stopped mentioning it completely.

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:38.040
It's as if

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:40.560
our Tang family is trying to climb the social ladder through them.

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:43.720
With our Ju'er's qualities,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.000
so many young men

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.560
are lining up to court her.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.480
Yes.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.800
Translator Luo...

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.879
No,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Zhiyong.

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:00.839
We are living in chaotic times.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.279
And I...

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.040
don't care about old traditions anymore.

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:06.560
In terms of age,

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.000
I'm a generation older than you.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.680
Let me just ask you one thing.

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:12.079
Can I...

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:14.399
entrust our Ju'er to you?

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:15.800
No, no, no.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.160
This...

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.360
I've just turned thirty,

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.560
and have no possessions to my name.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.759
I'm really not worthy.

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:24.160
How is it not worthy?

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:27.920
And about this marriage matter,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.600
let's... let's discuss it later.

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:34.360
Zhiyong,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.000
you and Ju'er are a perfect match.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.200
Very compatible.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.919
Come, come, drink, drink.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.879
Come, pour it, pour it.

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:49.600
Don't, let me do it.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.240
Let me, let me.

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:05.480
Alright.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.039
Let's stop here.

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:16.039
Here, this is for you.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.960
Si Po gave it to me.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.159
She said it's for protection.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.559
You still believe in this?

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.720
Aren't the Eighth Route Army all atheists?

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:27.519
Does it work?

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:29.480
It works if you believe.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.679
Alright.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.080
Hang it here.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.279
To keep everyone safe.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:53.519
Mm.

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:55.320
Keeping everyone safe is good.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.759
I'm going.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.320
Mm.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.360
Reporting

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.360
Come in

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:39.080
Reporting

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.639
This is the content of the Colonel's telegram

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:50.159
Plan to go to the Huangyang Mountain crash site tomorrow

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:52.519
to conduct a re-survey

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.480
Special report from Wumu Ichiro

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:00.240
There is nothing wrong with this telegram

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.240
No

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.600
This is a

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.559
working telegram reporting movements

00:11:03.559 --> 00:11:05.080
to the Chamberlain's Office Investigation Section in Dong Jing

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:06.759
Honestly

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:07.759
The only possibility

00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:09.519
is that such an unencrypted telegram

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:11.600
if intercepted

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.679
could have triggered

00:11:12.679 --> 00:11:15.000
today's skirmish at Huangyang Mountain

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.960
What you can think of

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.720
our Colonel Wumu

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.480
has already thought of long ago

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.480
Inoue

00:11:24.679 --> 00:11:25.480
Close the door

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.320
Sasaki

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.919
Let's see your findings

00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:29.840
Yes

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:35.639
This is

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.919
In the Colonel's luggage

00:11:37.919 --> 00:11:39.159
we found a micro camera

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.679
and a pen-shaped storage device

00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:44.799
with microfilm hidden inside

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:46.000
A tooth powder box containing invisible ink

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.919
In the small bottle is

00:11:46.919 --> 00:11:48.480
developer fluid for secret communications

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.080
Also a ring key for picking locks

00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:55.600
And

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.399
this

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.000
A cylindrical micro cipher machine

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:05.039
These are all

00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:06.720
the most advanced tools for spies

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.320
Could this Colonel

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.960
be a spy

00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:24.799
The black box in this photo

00:12:24.799 --> 00:12:26.279
what is it used for

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.840
I asked the Intelligence Section

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:29.759
This is a

00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:30.519
cassette storage container

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:31.720
for micro camera film

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:39.399
This

00:12:39.399 --> 00:12:41.399
what is this thing that looks like a snail

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:43.080
This thing is called

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.000
the Chicago Turret Invisible Spy Gun

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.679
It can fire four bullets in succession

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.360
It is a high-ranking investigator

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.519
or high-ranking spy's

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.000
last weapon for self-defense

00:12:53.799 --> 00:12:55.480
The Cabinet Investigation Office really

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.759
has quite a few advanced things

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:58.720
Yes

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.720
What interests me most

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.399
is the invisible ink tool the Colonel brought

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.559
Apart from using our radio station

00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:06.720
to report work to Dong Jing

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.759
he shouldn't have

00:13:07.759 --> 00:13:09.159
a second channel of communication

00:13:09.559 --> 00:13:10.600
Then

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:11.840
regarding Admiral Osumi Mineo's

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.519
crash investigation details

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:14.559
I estimate he would use invisible ink

00:13:14.559 --> 00:13:15.919
to record them somewhere

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:17.799
According to our observation

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.679
the Colonel carries a

00:13:23.679 --> 00:13:25.480
small notebook

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.519
that never leaves his person

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.960
Is that so

00:13:31.279 --> 00:13:32.960
Is there anything else

00:13:33.159 --> 00:13:33.960
Yes

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.480
Captain Oshima sent someone to the radio room

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.360
to find out about Colonel Wumu's

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.519
situation regarding telegrams to Dong Jing

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.080
What did you do

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.399
They requested

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:44.639
not to disturb you

00:13:44.919 --> 00:13:46.519
and quietly check the Colonel's telegrams

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.120
I gave it to them

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:50.559
Good

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.799
Regarding Colonel Wumu

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:53.799
find another chance to investigate further

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.240
I will be loyal to the Emperor

00:13:57.519 --> 00:13:59.879
and I don't wish to offend the investigator from the Palace

00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:00.879
However

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.000
I absolutely cannot unwittingly

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.759
become a sacrifice

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.000
in the bureaucratic struggles of the Imperial Headquarters

00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:06.480
You may leave

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.679
Yes

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.720
Thank you for your hard work, sir

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.360
Captain.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.480
What do you think?

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.399
That mysterious man in Macau...

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:44.279
what is his relationship with the Colonel?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.639
Captain.

00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:49.279
Do you suspect Colonel Takeki

00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:54.879
is a spy for the Chiang regime's Juntong?

00:14:54.879 --> 00:14:56.639
Imperial Headquarters and the Emperor sent men

00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:58.720
to investigate Admiral Osumi Mineo's crash.

00:15:00.159 --> 00:15:01.840
They suspect certain officers were involved.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.399
This is inevitable.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.480
Investigators need to use special means

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.480
to obtain certain evidence.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.919
They also need to use secret writing.

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:10.840
So,

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.600
based solely on these espionage tools,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.080
we cannot draw such a conclusion yet.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.279
I suppose so.

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:19.799
A senior officer of the Imperial Guard Division...

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.039
how could he be with the Chiang regime's Juntong?

00:15:23.879 --> 00:15:28.360
It's simply inconceivable.

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:05.480
An uninvited guest has entered the room again.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.679
Is it Oshima Hiroshi's man or Fujita's?

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.279
For our next step regarding Colonel Takeki,

00:16:18.279 --> 00:16:21.480
shall we launch a secret investigation?

00:16:24.039 --> 00:16:26.159
Are you prepared to openly declare war

00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:27.240
on the investigator sent by the Emperor?

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.519
Even though this time

00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:31.120
Sasaki has made a major discovery,

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.480
can we still not investigate openly?

00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:35.240
You must use your brain more.

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:36.960
Use your wisdom.

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:38.519
Although this time, at his place,

00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:39.120
many espionage tools were found,

00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:40.000
the work of verifying them

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.799
will likely still need to be done by us.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.399
In other words,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.799
do you mean

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:53.080
we haven't grasped the main point yet?

00:16:53.799 --> 00:16:54.399
Correct.

00:16:55.879 --> 00:16:58.559
What is Colonel Takeki's dilemma?

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:00.080
And taking so many people this time,

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.960
fighting all the way to Huangyang Mountain.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.480
The real issue of his trip to Huangyang Mountain,

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.319
has it been resolved?

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:09.160
We don't know.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.240
Colonel Takeki's true purpose for going to Huangyang Mountain,

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.880
what is it?

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.119
That is exactly what I'm talking about.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.559
He went to Huangyang Mountain,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.799
wasn't it to re-survey

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:25.680
the crash site of Admiral Osumi Mineo?

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.680
I feel that might not be the purpose.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.680
When they took action,

00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:32.920
I sent Sasaki to the pier to count

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.759
the number of people Colonel Takeki took out.

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:39.519
The number of people going out was exactly right.

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:40.759
It was somewhat unexpected to me.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.119
So you suspected,

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:44.839
Captain,

00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:47.119
that the Colonel would use this opportunity

00:17:47.119 --> 00:17:50.039
to smuggle that American out?

00:17:50.839 --> 00:17:51.839
However,

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.279
he didn't smuggle anyone out.

00:17:57.279 --> 00:17:59.039
So what on earth did he go to Huangyang Mountain for?

00:18:02.079 --> 00:18:03.039
I think his trip to Huangyang Mountain

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:03.839
could only have one purpose.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.839
Was it to use that attack

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:07.160
to escape in the chaos?

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:08.839
Abandoning that Chinese lover

00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:09.839
and escaping just like that?

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.759
Your analysis makes no sense.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.400
Besides,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.240
if Colonel Takeki wanted to leave Sanzao Island,

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.119
he has all the necessary conditions.

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:23.559
As long as he wants to go,

00:18:23.559 --> 00:18:25.000
all his paperwork is in order.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.720
It's complete.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.480
No one can stop him.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.000
Then what did he go to Huangyang Mountain for?

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:38.720
Well, about that,

00:18:39.559 --> 00:18:41.680
I can't say for sure either.

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:48.240
What the Colonel's true purpose is

00:18:49.839 --> 00:18:50.640
still requires us

00:18:52.359 --> 00:18:57.240
to analyze very carefully.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.400
Is it that they had something

00:19:03.599 --> 00:19:05.039
to send out?

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.319
So they manufactured

00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:09.319
such a skirmish?

00:19:10.079 --> 00:19:14.000
That is also a possibility.

00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:15.559
Your analysis

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:17.160
also makes some sense.

00:19:18.079 --> 00:19:19.519
This matter regarding Huangyang Mountain

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:21.279
is a bit fishy.

00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:24.359
With that American we haven't found,

00:19:25.079 --> 00:19:26.599
it definitely has a connection.

00:19:26.839 --> 00:19:27.720
That is possible.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.319
We can't make a judgment yet.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.480
If we can

00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:40.039
fully immerse ourselves in our opponent's mind,

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.319
think as he...

00:19:42.319 --> 00:19:44.240
how do you say it?

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.160
Put ourselves in his shoes and think what he thinks.

00:19:48.079 --> 00:19:49.720
Using this method

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.960
to analyze the opponent's psychology.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.680
Exactly.

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:00.160
If we can achieve this step,

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:02.640
we can see through the opponent's moves at a glance.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.480
This way we can achieve

00:20:04.759 --> 00:20:09.599
"knowing the enemy and yourself."

00:20:14.319 --> 00:20:14.960
This matter

00:20:16.359 --> 00:20:17.680
must only be known by the two of you.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.440
The investigation into the Colonel

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.200
must only be conducted in secret.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.640
It must not be leaked under any circumstances.

00:20:27.319 --> 00:20:27.960
Yes, sir.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:34.839
Colonel

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.440
Are you all right?

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.839
Captain Oshima

00:20:38.039 --> 00:20:39.160
Why are you here?

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.000
His Excellency the Commander sent me.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:46.960
Thanks to the Commander

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.599
sending Captain Oshima ahead of time,

00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:50.240
we avoided further casualties.

00:20:51.359 --> 00:20:54.400
I didn't send him.

00:20:56.599 --> 00:20:59.559
Oshima Hiroshi's insidiousness and cunning

00:20:59.559 --> 00:21:02.880
indeed greatly exceeded Wumu's expectations.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.720
He knew

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.720
that for the next step of action,

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.200
it must be carefully considered.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.240
Once a mistake appears,

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.960
or a small negligence,

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.200
the experienced Oshima Hiroshi

00:21:14.319 --> 00:21:16.599
will not let go of this opportunity.

00:21:17.079 --> 00:21:20.400
He will force him to give himself away.

00:21:24.519 --> 00:21:25.119
Inoue

00:21:25.519 --> 00:21:26.039
Yes, sir.

00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:27.680
Tomorrow, Sasaki and I

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.000
will go to Macau, China.

00:21:29.359 --> 00:21:31.480
Many things are related to Macau, China.

00:21:32.039 --> 00:21:33.079
Today at Mount Huangyang,

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:35.079
the opponents we met came from Macau, China.

00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:38.960
The two stowaways also came from Macau, China.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.759
Whether lifting the ban can kill two birds with one stone,

00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:42.079
the key still lies in Macau, China.

00:21:42.079 --> 00:21:44.519
It is time for us to go there.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.599
I understand.

00:21:46.599 --> 00:21:49.119
Then what about the squad?

00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:52.079
You will take charge of the squad.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.359
Yes, sir.

00:21:54.359 --> 00:21:55.079
But,

00:21:56.119 --> 00:21:57.359
do not provoke Colonel Wumu.

00:21:57.359 --> 00:21:59.200
You are no match for him.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.960
Act with caution in everything.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.319
Sasaki.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.119
Yes, sir.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:09.759
Notify Mr. Fukuda.

00:22:09.759 --> 00:22:10.839
We will use their boat tomorrow.

00:22:11.279 --> 00:22:11.920
Also,

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:12.960
go to the telecommunications room

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.839
and inform Colonel Eizawa.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.279
That tomorrow afternoon,

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.839
we will pay him a visit.

00:22:17.119 --> 00:22:17.880
Yes, sir.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:18.920
Sasaki.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.480
Here.

00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:22.119
You completed your mission very well.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.319
Go back and rest early.

00:22:26.279 --> 00:22:26.799
May I?

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.680
Inoue.

00:22:50.359 --> 00:22:51.240
Inoue.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.279
Yes?

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:56.039
Come here.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.000
Your attitude has been very poor lately.

00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:10.480
It is precisely because of this

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.279
that you remain a lieutenant.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.960
How many times do I have to tell you?

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.960
How many people have to surpass you?

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:22.000
Drinking and playing with women all day long.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.880
You weren't like this before.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.519
You used to be my excellent subordinate.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.039
Look at you now.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.960
What are you laughing at?

00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:33.960
What is it?

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:36.519
You're bringing this up again.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.559
What we are facing

00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:46.480
is a tough guy.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.200
Both strong and brave.

00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:51.839
He works meticulously and carefully.

00:23:53.079 --> 00:23:55.039
Watertight.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.240
With your current

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.319
absent-minded appearance,

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:01.319
you simply cannot deal with him.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.079
I am very worried about you.

00:24:05.559 --> 00:24:06.799
Did you hear me?

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.359
Did you hear me at all?

00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:21.039
Get out.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.480
Why are you drunk like this again?

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.599
You went to find that brat again, didn't you?

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.839
How many times have I told you?

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:23.039
Don't always throw yourself at someone who ignores you.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.759
Aren't you ashamed?

00:25:27.599 --> 00:25:29.599
But Brother Long Xia and I have a betrothal.

00:25:31.039 --> 00:25:32.079
Betrothal?

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:35.240
He doesn't want you anymore.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.839
In this world,

00:25:38.759 --> 00:25:40.880
the one who loves you most is me,

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.640
is your father.

00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:47.680
This Long Xia,

00:25:48.079 --> 00:25:50.039
who knows what the hell he's doing all day.

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:51.960
No.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.880
I have to go find him.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.720
Where are you going?

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:56.079
I'm going to find him.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.599
Stay here.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.240
Are you really going?

00:27:42.039 --> 00:27:42.920
Who is it?

00:27:47.759 --> 00:27:49.279
It's President Tang.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.279
Fourth Grandma.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.359
Fourth Grandma.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.400
Where is De Gong?

00:28:11.599 --> 00:28:12.599
Bingchen.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.599
De Gong.

00:28:20.039 --> 00:28:21.039
It's so late.

00:28:21.359 --> 00:28:22.240
What's the matter?

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.240
Come.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.039
Let's talk inside.

00:28:25.759 --> 00:28:26.640
No need.

00:28:31.599 --> 00:28:32.279
Speak, then.

00:28:35.119 --> 00:28:35.559
Fine.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.839
Then I might as well...

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.319
...make things clear.

00:28:40.519 --> 00:28:41.480
Say it straight.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.240
Between the Tang family and the Ye family...

00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:48.480
...it's time to make a clean break.

00:28:48.759 --> 00:28:49.799
What do you mean?

00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:53.319
The engagement between Ju'er and Xia'er...

00:28:53.759 --> 00:28:55.359
...is long void.

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.480
Consider that I, Tang Bingchen...

00:28:57.599 --> 00:28:58.799
...am unworthy of the honor.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.039
De Gong.

00:29:00.039 --> 00:29:01.680
I came today to ask you...

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.640
...to control your son...

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.920
...and leave my Ju'er alone.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.640
Don't disturb her anymore.

00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:07.400
President Tang.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.960
What do you mean by that?

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.839
You think I don't know?

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.119
You, time and again...

00:29:16.119 --> 00:29:17.480
...pester our Ju'er...

00:29:17.599 --> 00:29:18.319
...making her follow you...

00:29:18.319 --> 00:29:19.799
...to do those dangerous things.

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:21.359
Have you ever thought about it?

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:23.039
If the Japanese find out...

00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:24.359
...what the consequences would be?

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Ju'er could lose her life.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.000
You like working for the Japanese.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.720
I don't care.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.720
It's none of my business.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.079
But the matter between Ju'er and me...

00:29:32.079 --> 00:29:33.240
...you don't understand.

00:29:33.359 --> 00:29:34.119
Don't you come here...

00:29:34.119 --> 00:29:34.759
Shut up!

00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:39.279
Bingchen

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.000
Is there some misunderstanding here?

00:29:45.799 --> 00:29:46.960
Ju'er and Xia'er...

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.680
...grew up together.

00:29:49.279 --> 00:29:50.160
I treat Ju'er...

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.960
...like my own flesh and blood.

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:53.359
De-gong.

00:29:54.119 --> 00:29:55.559
"Own flesh and blood"? We really...

00:29:55.559 --> 00:29:57.400
...can't bear that honor.

00:30:00.599 --> 00:30:01.480
I beg you.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.319
Just have some pity...

00:30:03.319 --> 00:30:05.000
...on my old bones.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.160
I'm not like you.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.640
You have a big family and business...

00:30:07.799 --> 00:30:09.519
...and so many heirs.

00:30:10.039 --> 00:30:12.400
My backbone isn't as strong as yours.

00:30:13.759 --> 00:30:15.799
I only have Ju'er, this one daughter.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.240
Daughter...

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:20.720
You call a daughter a "pearl in the palm."

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.319
Right?

00:30:21.519 --> 00:30:21.920
Well, Ju'er...

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.799
...is also my pearl in the palm.

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:25.400
I also want to hold her in my palm.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.480
But I'm afraid I can't hold onto her.

00:30:28.759 --> 00:30:30.240
Ju'er is my only child.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.559
She is my heart and soul.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.559
If something happens to her...

00:30:33.559 --> 00:30:35.000
...what am I supposed to do?

00:30:36.079 --> 00:30:36.839
Bingchen.

00:30:37.599 --> 00:30:39.319
No one wants to hurt Ju'er.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.240
No one will hurt her?

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.519
De-gong.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.759
Who calls the shots on this island right now?

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:50.200
Do you call the shots?

00:30:50.359 --> 00:30:51.559
Do I call the shots?

00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:54.079
Isn't it the Japanese who call the shots?

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.839
We bow and scrape all day...

00:30:58.839 --> 00:30:59.920
...nodding and bowing.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.720
What are we after?

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.279
We just want to catch our breath.

00:31:02.279 --> 00:31:03.920
Just want to stay alive, right?

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.880
I just hope...

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.680
...that my Ju'er and I...

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.279
...can peacefully...

00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:10.920
...live our lives, that's all.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.359
Not like your Longxia.

00:31:12.359 --> 00:31:13.279
Always rushing about...

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:14.920
...wanting to fight the Japanese.

00:31:15.119 --> 00:31:15.720
Hmph.

00:31:16.079 --> 00:31:17.240
Overestimating himself.

00:31:18.279 --> 00:31:18.960
President Tang.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.680
People aren't livestock.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.319
People need dignity to live.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:23.799
Livestock? Xia'er...

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.039
Who are you calling livestock?

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:28.640
I can't explain it to you.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.480
I wasn't talking about you.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.480
Why are you taking it personally?

00:31:32.039 --> 00:31:33.279
Since I was young, I've admired those...

00:31:33.279 --> 00:31:34.200
...chivalrous heroes.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.079
My dad taught me from a young age...

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.160
...that a good man...

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.359
...should sacrifice himself for his country.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.279
Even Ju'er understands these things.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.720
You, as a father...

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.599
...how can you be less than a girl?

00:31:43.759 --> 00:31:44.480
Xia'er!

00:31:47.079 --> 00:31:47.839
Fine.

00:31:48.119 --> 00:31:49.559
I really asked for this humiliation.

00:31:49.559 --> 00:31:50.279
Coming all the way here...

00:31:50.359 --> 00:31:51.599
...to let a youngster...

00:31:52.119 --> 00:31:53.240
...lecture me.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.039
Good.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.519
You...

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.839
...go be your chivalrous hero.

00:31:57.839 --> 00:31:59.359
No one is stopping you.

00:31:59.359 --> 00:32:01.119
But don't drag my Ju'er...

00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:02.720
...to be your sacrificial lamb.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.599
Who's using her as a sacrificial lamb?

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.759
What kind of person do you think I am?

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.079
If you're a good man...

00:32:09.079 --> 00:32:10.200
...then don't let...

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.200
...a girl live in fear for you.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.000
Fine.

00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:15.039
I won't go look for her anymore.

00:32:15.039 --> 00:32:15.519
Happy now?

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:16.160
Good.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.039
You said it.

00:32:18.039 --> 00:32:19.279
I said it, and I mean it.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.119
Just because of you...

00:32:20.119 --> 00:32:21.599
...I won't go look for her ever again.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.680
Please leave.

00:32:23.039 --> 00:32:23.880
Let go.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.640
Stop right there

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.319
If you want to be a real man

00:32:37.839 --> 00:32:39.119
and you want dignity

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.839
then you must keep your word

00:32:43.799 --> 00:32:44.599
Bingchen

00:32:45.799 --> 00:32:47.119
The children are grown up

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.799
They have their own ideas

00:32:49.079 --> 00:32:50.480
As parents

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.759
we should interfere less

00:32:52.039 --> 00:32:53.240
Let them be

00:32:54.559 --> 00:32:56.000
Say no more

00:32:57.119 --> 00:32:58.680
You go your way

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.799
and I'll go mine

00:33:01.319 --> 00:33:02.039
The Tang family

00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:03.400
and the Ye family

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.599
are done with each other

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.160
And you, Long Xia

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.359
remember what you said

00:33:12.039 --> 00:33:13.000
Brother De

00:33:13.799 --> 00:33:15.240
from now on

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.960
let's just mind our own children

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.200
Please, wait

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.359
Why be so impulsive

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.400
After all

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.240
he is Ju'er's father

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.880
Put it here, hurry

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:46.039
Load it on the boat, quick

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.719
Everyone, we're setting off

00:35:30.679 --> 00:35:33.000
Brother, can I put my bag up there

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.039
Carry it yourself

00:35:34.039 --> 00:35:35.559
Army pilots

00:35:47.679 --> 00:35:49.880
How many planes have been hoisted

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.400
Report, sir.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.679
The deck is almost full

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.079
I think we can fit one more

00:35:55.079 --> 00:35:56.119
If we load one more

00:35:56.119 --> 00:35:56.599
Jimmy

00:35:56.599 --> 00:35:57.480
you won't have enough room

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.639
to take off from the deck

00:35:58.639 --> 00:35:59.119
Sir

00:35:59.119 --> 00:36:00.800
taking off in such a short distance might be impossible

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.480
Lieutenant

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.880
How far do you think it is from here

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.639
to the end of the runway

00:36:05.719 --> 00:36:07.840
Looks like about 250 yards

00:36:08.239 --> 00:36:08.840
If we load another plane

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.880
it will be 230 yards

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:15.079
Using the extra lift from the bow

00:36:15.639 --> 00:36:17.079
it's possible

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.519
When the ship rides over the waves

00:36:18.519 --> 00:36:19.760
we can give it a try

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.039
Using the extra lift from the bow

00:36:22.679 --> 00:36:24.800
Do you think you can do it

00:36:25.159 --> 00:36:26.039
Yes, sir

00:36:26.679 --> 00:36:27.519
If that's the case

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:29.639
over 200 yards is enough

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.239
If that's the case

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.880
over 200 yards is enough

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.559
Teach our men

00:36:37.559 --> 00:36:39.119
some Navy knowledge

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.119
Then you can launch

00:36:42.039 --> 00:36:44.280
the 16th plane from the carrier

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.880
Yes, sir

00:36:46.559 --> 00:36:47.960
Happy to be of service

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:48.880
Sir

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.480
Plane 16 is ready

00:36:53.679 --> 00:36:54.960
Continue hoisting, Sergeant

00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:04.119
Lieutenant Colonel, this way please

00:37:07.679 --> 00:37:08.599
Captain Mitscher has vacated his quarters

00:37:08.599 --> 00:37:09.880
for you

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.920
That is very kind of him

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.559
I cannot accept it

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.840
It's the Captain's orders

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.480
sir

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.679
Everyone on this Hornet

00:37:16.679 --> 00:37:18.280
is under the Captain's command

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.559
Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle

00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:01.119
Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle

00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:03.639
General Arnold orders the Lieutenant Colonel

00:38:03.639 --> 00:38:05.639
to disembark immediately

00:38:05.639 --> 00:38:09.840
to take an urgent call from Washington

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.880
Is General Arnold changing his mind

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:13.960
The call must be taken

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:14.880
We'll sail slowly

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.000
and wait for your return

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.079
General

00:38:34.079 --> 00:38:35.480
Have you changed your mind?

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.480
The Hornet has already set sail

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.039
I can't go back to Washington

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.079
Who's taking you back?

00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:42.039
Doolittle

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.599
Who is this?

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:44.800
Marshall

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.360
George Catlett Marshall

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.079
Doolittle

00:38:47.079 --> 00:38:49.239
How is your mission coming along?

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.719
General Marshall

00:38:50.719 --> 00:38:51.280
Sir

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.480
I'm sorry

00:38:52.679 --> 00:38:54.199
I thought General Arnold

00:38:54.199 --> 00:38:55.239
changed his mind

00:38:55.239 --> 00:38:56.599
and wouldn't let me lead this mission

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.000
Doolittle

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.400
I haven't even said

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.360
"Good luck" to you yet

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.280
How could I easily

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.400
let you go?

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.559
Sorry, General, I misunderstood

00:39:05.239 --> 00:39:05.960
Doolittle

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.679
There are two things

00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:08.239
I must tell you right away

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.199
The first is

00:39:09.199 --> 00:39:10.880
after the bombing,

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.320
the plan to fly to the Soviet Union

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.760
and Vladivostok

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:15.960
was just rejected a few minutes ago

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.320
formally by the Soviet authorities

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.920
Understood

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.559
The Soviet Union and Japan

00:39:20.559 --> 00:39:22.599
signed a neutrality pact

00:39:22.599 --> 00:39:23.239
They couldn't help us

00:39:23.239 --> 00:39:24.039
resolve this issue

00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:26.079
Therefore, Quzhou Airport is

00:39:26.079 --> 00:39:28.360
the only airport you can land at

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.480
Because the Japanese army

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.679
is already wreaking havoc in that area,

00:39:32.159 --> 00:39:33.679
China has set the 20th

00:39:33.679 --> 00:39:35.679
as the deadline for your arrival

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.760
Yes, sir

00:39:39.039 --> 00:39:40.280
The second thing

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.320
Make it clear to your men

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.320
this raid

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.000
you will have no fighter escort

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.039
The survival rate for pilots

00:39:46.039 --> 00:39:47.400
is less than fifty percent

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:50.079
Understood

00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:52.719
That's all, Jimmy

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.000
Please allow me to say

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.400
good luck to you all

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.400
I hope to see you back in Washington

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.400
very soon

00:39:59.519 --> 00:40:00.400
Yes, sir

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.119
We guarantee to complete the mission

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.119
Take me back to the ship

00:41:16.639 --> 00:41:18.039
Operation One initiated

00:41:18.079 --> 00:41:19.599
I order

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.960
all ships from now on

00:41:24.199 --> 00:41:27.679
to maintain radio silence

00:41:27.679 --> 00:41:30.599
Communication between ships

00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:32.000
is restricted to light and flag signals

00:41:32.039 --> 00:41:37.000
Heavy Cruiser copies

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.920
Light Cruiser Nashville copies

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:45.000
Vincennes copies

Destroyer Gwin copies

Meredith copies

Monssen copies

Grayson copies

Oiler Cimarron copies

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.480
Early morning, April 2, 1942

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:26.440
Task Force 18 leaves Alameda Naval Port

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.519
Heading for the Pacific
