'Son Yooha'

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:52.060
Yooha?

00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:54.144
Minwoo,

00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:56.231
do you have a moment?

00:01:57.065 --> 00:01:58.483
What is it?

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:01.653
I'd like to talk face-to-face.

00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:05.156
I'm outside your office.

00:02:05.573 --> 00:02:06.991
Outside?

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.450
Yes.

00:02:11.287 --> 00:02:13.957
Okay. I'll be right out.

00:02:30.723 --> 00:02:31.724
Yooha!

00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:38.523
Minwoo,

00:02:43.528 --> 00:02:45.968
I don't think I can do
the boyfriend-for-hire service anymore.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:48.699
What?

00:02:50.243 --> 00:02:52.579
I found a client with better terms.

00:02:55.164 --> 00:02:56.207
So...

00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:03.464
I'm quitting.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.930
Thank you

00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:16.227
for everything.

00:03:20.523 --> 00:03:21.566
Oh, and...

00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:30.408
What's this?

00:03:33.036 --> 00:03:35.038
Compensation for

00:03:37.081 --> 00:03:38.291
your laptop and bag.

00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:48.343
Yooha! There you are~

00:03:51.346 --> 00:03:53.973
Minwoo, I'll head out first.

00:03:56.643 --> 00:03:57.810
Shall we go?

00:04:45.858 --> 00:04:46.901
Yooha

00:05:24.856 --> 00:05:25.940
Yooha

00:05:27.734 --> 00:05:29.485
Did the food suit your taste?

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:32.779
Yes,

00:05:33.906 --> 00:05:35.116
it was really good.

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:37.994
I'm glad.

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:46.044
Is there a bug on the table?

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.420
Oh, no!

00:05:50.214 --> 00:05:53.426
I'm not boring you, am I?

00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:55.636
No,

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.513
of course not.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.479
I'll take care of the bar issues.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.649
You don't have to worry.

00:06:10.693 --> 00:06:11.736
Thank you so much...

00:06:14.113 --> 00:06:18.826
I'll also provide enough support
to hire staff for operations.

00:06:31.047 --> 00:06:32.090
Suyeon...

00:06:36.052 --> 00:06:38.346
why are you helping me this much?

00:06:42.767 --> 00:06:43.935
Why?

00:06:46.646 --> 00:06:48.689
Because I like you.

00:06:52.902 --> 00:06:55.029
But as you probably know,

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:57.323
nothing in life comes for free.

00:06:58.658 --> 00:07:00.784
If I'm helping this much,

00:07:00.785 --> 00:07:01.953
you should give me

00:07:02.954 --> 00:07:05.665
a little more of your heart, too.

00:07:14.924 --> 00:07:15.924
Okay, I will.

00:07:29.105 --> 00:07:31.023
You've sorted things
out with Minwoo, right?

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:42.659
Yes.

00:07:45.746 --> 00:07:46.789
It's over.

00:07:51.752 --> 00:07:53.004
That's good.

00:08:00.178 --> 00:08:01.721
From now on,

00:08:02.513 --> 00:08:04.557
I'll be the one by your side.

00:09:24.053 --> 00:09:26.346
One Tequila Sunrise
and one Godfather, please.

00:09:26.347 --> 00:09:27.807
Ah, yes. Got it.

'CEO Ha Suyeon' 'Why aren't you answering my calls?'
'Did you get off work?' 'Are you free this Saturday?'

00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:38.456
Mr... Son Yooha

00:12:39.874 --> 00:12:40.874
Minwoo

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.877
How...

00:12:44.003 --> 00:12:46.755
How could you do this to me?

00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:49.884
Minwoo, you're drunk. Go home.

00:12:50.718 --> 00:12:51.802
Ha Suyeon...

00:12:54.263 --> 00:12:56.432
Did she offer that much money?

00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:02.021
I really thought...

00:13:03.105 --> 00:13:05.483
I could trust you...

00:13:08.235 --> 00:13:10.654
Uh... Minwoo, are you okay?

00:13:11.864 --> 00:13:13.824
Hey, come on, snap out of it.

00:13:14.325 --> 00:13:15.576
I...

00:13:16.243 --> 00:13:19.288
still need you...

00:13:36.847 --> 00:13:37.973
Minwoo...

00:13:39.808 --> 00:13:40.976
Minwoo...

00:14:16.136 --> 00:14:17.596
Mr. Minwoo

00:14:22.184 --> 00:14:23.352
Mr. Minwoo

00:14:33.821 --> 00:14:35.072
Who are you...?

00:14:35.823 --> 00:14:40.159
Oh! I'm Yooha's friend, Bae Jaemin.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.996
Where's Yooha?

00:14:42.413 --> 00:14:45.124
He's probably with Suyeon right now.

00:14:45.499 --> 00:14:46.959
Do you know where they went?

00:14:51.755 --> 00:14:52.840
Mr. Minwoo,

00:14:54.425 --> 00:14:55.593
Taeha...

00:14:56.427 --> 00:14:58.387
Yooha's brother

00:14:59.972 --> 00:15:01.264
he's gone missing.

00:15:01.265 --> 00:15:02.474
The boss?

00:15:02.641 --> 00:15:03.641
Yes.

00:15:03.767 --> 00:15:07.062
No one's seen him for days. But,

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.065
the night before he disappeared,

00:15:14.194 --> 00:15:17.197
I saw Suyeon. She was here.

00:15:17.656 --> 00:15:18.949
Ha Suyeon...

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.245
It could be a coincidence,

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.370
but

00:15:25.164 --> 00:15:27.291
it's just... I can't
stop thinking about it.

00:15:29.084 --> 00:15:30.586
I need to find him.

00:15:31.754 --> 00:15:32.754
Ah

00:15:33.005 --> 00:15:34.005
Wait!

00:15:38.677 --> 00:15:40.471
Yooha wanted to protect everything...

00:15:41.096 --> 00:15:42.890
his brother, the bar,

00:15:45.225 --> 00:15:46.685
and you, Minwoo.
