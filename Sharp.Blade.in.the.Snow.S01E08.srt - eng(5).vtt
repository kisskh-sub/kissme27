00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.120
What's wrong?

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.520
The killer

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.480
used iron nails to pin their palms

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.520
in place,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.160
then pierced their throats.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.520
So the blood

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.360
should have sprayed out.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.860
But look at this blood.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.940
It's more like it was splashed on.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.400
Let's take a closer look.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.570
This isn't human blood.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.160
What?

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.680
How's that possible?

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.960
Then where did the blood
of those female officials go?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.460
Killing to harvest blood—

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.140
it definitely wasn't done by the slaves.

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.280
But those slaves have been
on the run till now,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.240
with no trace.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.560
There's no way to verify it.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.289
So there's still no clue at all.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.840
Look.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.760
This footprint is very unusual.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.760
Small and narrow in size.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.039
It doesn't belong to a slave
or a female official.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.000
The sand

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.560
mixed into it

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.040
comes from rare Ruizhou scorched soil.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.370
Something like this

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.600
can't be found anywhere for miles around.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.000
How could it appear here?

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.280
Feng Li.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.920
Little Beggar.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.520
Demon Lord.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.480
A child who was exiled and humiliated—

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.360
how could she possibly be

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.620
the mastermind who destroyed my Dongli?

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.200
Absolutely ridiculous.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.320
Aunt.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.440
I'm scared.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.040
Li, it's all right. Don't be scared.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.410
Back when I lived in the wasteland,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.120
whenever there were
thunderstorms like this,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.520
I would hide in the grass.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.840
Freezing rainwater

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.300
would rush down from the roof,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.079
soaking my clothes through.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.160
Thunder and lightning

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.600
would slip through the cracks in the door

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.130
and strike right by my ears.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.120
At times like that,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.680
wolves would lurk outside.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.320
They were waiting

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.120
for the wind, driven by the storm,
to blow open

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.720
that shaky, crumbling door.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.440
But now you've grown up.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.240
You are a supremely noble Queen.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.360
Living within an impregnable palace,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.200
what is there left to fear?

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.400
Really,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.560
Aunt?

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.800
You are the apple of the eye

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.000
of my dearest sister.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.040
Her most beloved daughter.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.960
By my side,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.000
you have nothing to fear.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.440
Aunt.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.840
Will you love me like my mother did?

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.320
Good children

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.960
always make people feel tender.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.220
Who goes there?

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.159
Your Highness, something's wrong!

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.520
Your Majesty?

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.680
Everyone, stop at once!

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.520
Mr. Bai.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.040
If you keep blocking us,

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.360
don't blame us for being rude.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.720
The matter hasn't been investigated yet.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.120
You can't take them away.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.640
I'd like to see who dares.

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:46.720
Who?

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.920
Have you lost your minds...

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.480
Your Majesty.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.400
What madness has seized you?

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.220
How dare you
draw your blades against my man?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.800
Are you all right, Bai?

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.040
Are you hurt?

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.970
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.360
So late at night,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.160
and it's this lively here—

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.940
for what reason, I wonder?

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.640
The heavy rain washed down
from the mountains

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.800
these half-rotted male corpses.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.520
Mr. Bai repeatedly stopped us

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.050
from burying these bodies.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.640
If they're not dealt with in time,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.240
it could lead to an epidemic.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.720
For something this important,

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.580
why weren't those fools stopped?

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.760
The Slave House case
hasn't been solved yet.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.290
What if they really are
those escaped slaves?

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.620
They might still be carrying some clues.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.600
Right, Li?

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.600
I was negligent.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.940
I deserve punishment.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.520
Over such a trivial matter,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.760
you dared lay hands on my man.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.730
Looks like you truly
have no regard for me.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.400
You handled matters
so carelessly and incompetently.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.200
Your Majesty.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.080
I think

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.800
from now on, the Slave House case

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.400
should be placed
under Mr. Bai's supervision.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.880
I will follow your arrangements, Aunt.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.280
The Golden Water is
at just the right temperature today.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.120
As expected,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.820
the freshest Golden Water

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.800
is the most nourishing for the skin.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.840
Does it still hurt?

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.400
It was my negligence, Your Highness.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.600
I let that wretched girl
seize the chance to make trouble.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.160
Feng Li

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.680
is more and more like a Queen now.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.160
But the Slave House

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.960
is where we keep our blood stock.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:55.970
If she were to...

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.400
There is no "if."

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.440
Feng Li

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.640
doesn't have much time left anyway.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.000
For us now,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.040
what matters most

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.880
is to obtain Phoenix Incense's formula.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.320
Since that Yun Zhan

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.840
has yet to succeed,

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.520
why not

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.650
try switching to another chess piece?

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.040
Your Majesty.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.680
Bai.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.840
Do you know what it feels like

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.250
to be burned by a branding iron?

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.880
A red-hot iron,

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.580
pressed against human flesh—

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.440
clothes and skin

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.240
stick together as one.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.160
At first, you won't feel any pain.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.480
But once the iron is lifted,

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.040
the charred skin

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.300
will be torn away together with the iron,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.920
ripped right off your body.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.520
At the beginning, you feel nothing.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.330
That kind of pain...

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.200
No, Your Majesty!

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.320
No!

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.760
That kind of pain

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.240
cuts straight to the bone.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:47.760
No!

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.000
No, Your Majesty!

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.880
No!

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.840
No, Your Majesty!

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.570
Is it beautiful?

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.080
Spare my life, Your Majesty!

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.520
Then this flower—

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.640
let me see where it should fall.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.440
No!

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.240
Your Majesty!

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.280
We were only following orders.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.520
About what happened at the Slave House—

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.880
we truly knew nothing.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.480
Look how frightened you are.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.480
Bai.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.210
Since their mouths are sealed so tightly,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.760
there's no need to keep them.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.240
It was Lady Rao Jun!

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.000
It was Lady Rao Jun.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.080
She ordered us to deal with
and bury the male corpses.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:48.880
She said

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.080
she feared an outbreak of disease.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.160
We didn't dare think too much about it.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:53.760
But—

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.040
about those matters
concerning the red soil,

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.840
we truly know nothing.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.640
Your Majesty.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.920
Why not question the Horticulture Office
and the female officials?

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.600
They work daily
at the Earth Storage Pool.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.930
They must know something about this soil.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.980
The Horticulture Office?

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.360
Cut out their tongues.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.880
Some names, once spoken aloud,

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.440
always come at a price.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.800
No, Your Majesty!

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.960
No!

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.840
Your Majesty!

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.760
No!

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.280
Use Phoenix Incense's formula

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.280
to exchange for Feng Li's antidote.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.640
Cite Feng Li's poor health

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.820
and ease her into abdication.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.400
Your Majesty,
these flowers smell wonderful.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.880
I guarantee you and Feng Li

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.280
a lifetime together, just the two of you.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.640
Your future

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.080
will rest entirely in your hands.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.440
Bai.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.720
Bai.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.640
Don't blame me for being ruthless

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.370
and cutting out their tongues.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.240
If they were still able to speak,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.480
would surely kill them

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.880
to silence them.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.810
Your Majesty, what are you saying?

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.090
I understand all that you've done.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.960
I'm only worried about your health.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.880
You can't overexert yourself any longer.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.680
Your Majesty.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.600
Bai.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.480
I don't have much time left.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.560
Don't worry.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.800
I will protect you,

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.680
keep you safe,

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.160
and never let you leave my side again.
