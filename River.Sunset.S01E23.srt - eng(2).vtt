WEBVTT

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:34.239
Go

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:36.920
Colonel

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:38.319
After them

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.640
Hurry

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.239
Go, go

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:01.319
After them

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.040
After them

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:14.960
The Colonel is wounded

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.319
The Colonel is wounded

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.199
Medic

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.599
Medic

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.560
Colonel

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.080
Are you all right

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.560
Oshima

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.800
Why are you here

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.400
The Commander sent me

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.280
The Commander sent you

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.879
The Commander is very worried about you

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.159
He ordered me to come check on you

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.520
I happened to encounter you being ambushed

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.520
Thank you

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.800
Luckily you arrived in time

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120
By the way

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.560
Such a classified operation

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.280
We didn't know about it

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.120
How could you be ambushed

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.080
Ambush

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.879
You mean

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.400
They knew our operation in advance

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400
So they set an ambush here

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.800
Waiting for us

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.360
Isn't that so

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:28.199
Akino

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.400
Was our operation leaked

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.080
That is absolutely impossible

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.960
Are you sure

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.879
I guarantee it on my honor as a soldier

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:41.840
It was an encounter

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.120
If we were ambushed by the enemy

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.840
We wouldn't have heard the enemy's gunfire beforehand

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.159
Report

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400
Eight of our troops are dead

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.479
Two seriously wounded

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:52.319
Forty-four lightly wounded

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:53.319
Captain Akino

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:54.719
Take men to search

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.879
Prevent an enemy counterattack

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.879
Yes, sir

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.680
Let's go

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.919
Yes, sir

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:58.719
Don't worry about me

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:59.400
I'm fine

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.800
Tend to the other wounded

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.560
Yes, sir

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.319
Radio Operator

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.759
Report the situation here to HQ

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.159
Yes, sir

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.280
You should go back for treatment first

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.000
Let's go

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:28.240
Thank you

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.600
The contact mission failed

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.360
The code wasn't sent out either

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.199
Oshima Hiroshi led the Special Police Battalion

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.360
And arrived in a rush

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.399
Disrupting the entire plan

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:47.120
Wumu, in his heart

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.759
Secretly warned himself

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
To stay calm

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.399
The more agitated one is

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.680
The more one must calm down

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.480
It depends on the relaxation of muscles

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.120
And the slow beating of the heart

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.160
Grandma

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:48.360
The gauze and alcohol for wounds...

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.360
do we have any left at home?

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.160
There's a little bit left.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.279
Go get them for me.

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.519
Who got hurt?

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.839
Ke Wen.

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:55.720
Oh my.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.560
That Wen'er.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.000
He's always bumping into things.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.720
How did he hurt himself again?

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:01.639
Alright, alright.

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:02.240
I'll get it for you.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.160
I'll get it.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.839
You made a huge mistake this time.

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:07.920
I...

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.800
I... I...

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.319
You fired without orders.

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:13.000
Will Section Chief Shen let you off?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.839
Enough.

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:15.920
I know you're scared.

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:16.839
About this...

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:19.079
Big Brother will plead with him for you.

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:20.240
This little bit of face...

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.199
he surely has to give me.

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.319
I... I... I...

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.800
Section Chief Shen.

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:27.600
No...

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.639
Oh.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.800
Disobeying orders and firing unauthorized shots.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.240
I found the person for you.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.079
I'm making him kneel here as punishment.

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:37.240
Hurry up and apologize to Section Chief Shen.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.360
I'll take him back and teach him a lesson.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.879
Shen... Shen...

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.720
No...

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.319
You...

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:46.040
This...

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.480
You're on your own.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:42.799
Colonel.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.879
I suppose your purpose in coming to Huangyang Mountain...

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:48.320
was not achieved, was it?

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:49.759
After all, you encountered an attack.

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:50.879
And suffered losses.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.360
Thanks to Captain Oshima...

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.759
bringing his men in time.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.919
As the police captain on the island...

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:03.879
protecting the safety of personnel here...

00:09:03.879 --> 00:09:05.159
is my duty.

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:06.919
It's the same for you, Colonel, isn't it?

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:10.320
Thank you for your special concern.

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:52.240
Come.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.399
That's enough.

00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:02.159
Good.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.240
Where is Ying'er?

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.320
She seems to be with Wen'er.

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:11.159
I'll go look for her.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.360
Little duckling.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.200
Yellow feet.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.759
Quack, quack, quack.

00:10:22.159 --> 00:10:24.039
Yellow feet.

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:25.759
Flat beak.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.480
Little duckling.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.639
Quack, quack, quack.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.519
Looking for Mama.

00:10:33.919 --> 00:10:36.519
I'll take you home.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.519
Little duckling.

00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:40.000
Quack, quack, quack.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.480
Little duckling.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.960
You're singing the song from childhood...

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.600
that Grandma taught you, right?

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.639
Grandma.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.879
Hungry?

00:10:48.879 --> 00:10:49.240
Yingying.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:49.879
Little duckling.

00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:52.159
Go home and eat.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.080
I'm not hungry.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.960
Grandma.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.720
I want to stay here for a while.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.879
You guys go back first.

00:10:58.159 --> 00:10:59.039
Go back.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.639
Yingying.

00:11:08.039 --> 00:11:09.399
Tell Grandma.

00:11:09.679 --> 00:11:11.720
Is something on your mind?

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:22.600
Yingying.

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:26.639
Grandma understands you.

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:30.240
Tell Grandma the truth.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.279
Have you taken a fancy to that Japanese boy?

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.279
Grandma.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.639
Wumu is not a bad person.

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:09.879
Yingying

00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:12.759
Come here.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.600
Take this protective charm.

00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:21.000
Grandma doesn't know much else,

00:12:21.879 --> 00:12:23.399
but Grandma knows

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.720
that no matter where you go,

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:32.039
being safe is what matters.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.840
Mm-hmm.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.399
I understand.

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:39.799
Thank you, Grandma.

00:12:43.799 --> 00:12:45.120
They're back.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.080
Grandma, I want to go take a look.

00:12:48.039 --> 00:12:49.399
You take Kewen back first.

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:50.240
Okay?

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.799
I'll go back a bit later.

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:53.799
Okay.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.240
Let's go.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.960
Go home and eat.

00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:03.919
Going home.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.519
Come on.

00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:05.799
The sun has gone down.

00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:06.759
Time to eat.

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:08.279
Time to eat, you must be hungry.

00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:09.000
Yeah.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.120
Go back with Grandma to eat.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:10.919
Time to eat.

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:11.600
Let's go.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.000
Time to eat.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.240
This woman really does like

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.480
our Colonel here.

00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:40.879
Captain.

00:14:41.879 --> 00:14:43.600
Today, Colonel Rongzezuo in Macau

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.960
sent a telegram.

00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:47.320
Colonel Rongzezuo

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.840
inside An Lan Tang,

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.720
has captured someone.

00:14:52.039 --> 00:14:53.000
That's great.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.480
All our men have boarded the truck.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.720
Shall we go back for a drink?

00:14:57.919 --> 00:14:58.639
Inoue.

00:14:58.799 --> 00:14:59.360
Yes, sir.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.519
Tomorrow I plan to go with Sasaki

00:15:00.519 --> 00:15:01.559
to Macau together.

00:15:01.559 --> 00:15:02.720
You are in charge here at the unit.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.759
To Macau?

00:15:04.759 --> 00:15:05.399
Yes.

00:15:05.879 --> 00:15:07.519
There's progress on the Macau matter.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.480
An Lan Tang is actually

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.200
the Sanzao Island Fellow Townsmen Association.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.000
The Macau locals call them the Eighth District boys.

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:18.679
In the past,

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:20.039
the incidents on the island

00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:22.320
of missing soldiers and sneak attacks

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.480
had a lot to do with them.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:26.639
This trip of ours

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.480
is to lay some bait for them.

00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:30.200
They will take the hook.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.399
I see.

00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:33.720
Understood.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.000
Let's go back.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.159
Attention, everyone!

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:39.279
Forward, march!

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.679
Colonel, are you alright?

00:16:14.559 --> 00:16:16.279
I'm fine, you may go.

00:16:17.879 --> 00:16:18.720
Yes, sir.

00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:31.279
Do not keep in this ward

00:17:31.279 --> 00:17:32.680
any other wounded soldiers.

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:34.559
Reporting, Colonel.

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:35.960
There is still one empty bed in this ward.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.480
The wounded man in this room

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.319
is a very important witness for me.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.480
I must prevent him from contacting anyone.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.920
Move the empty bed to another room.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.240
Yes, sir.

00:17:46.319 --> 00:17:47.319
You two, come here.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.119
Follow me.

00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:30.799
You're injured.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.319
It's nothing.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.559
You keep it.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.000
Take it away when you have the chance.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.039
Don't worry about me.

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:18.400
What needs to be taken away,

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.480
not a single thing will be missing.

00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:31.480
Fujita is here.

00:19:31.759 --> 00:19:32.960
I need to go out and deal with him.

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.480
Salute

00:20:05.799 --> 00:20:07.400
You're injured

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:09.799
Is it serious?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.200
I'm all right

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.759
But many soldiers in the anti-aircraft squadron

00:20:12.759 --> 00:20:13.720
have been injured

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.279
Carry on

00:20:15.279 --> 00:20:16.400
Everyone carry on

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.599
Yes, sir

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.799
Casualties on the battlefield

00:20:19.799 --> 00:20:21.119
are quite normal

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.039
Don't feel bad about it

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.119
How are the casualties?

00:20:27.319 --> 00:20:28.759
Reporting, Commander

00:20:28.759 --> 00:20:30.400
Eight dead, forty-six wounded

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.279
Thanks to the Commander

00:20:32.279 --> 00:20:34.039
sending Captain Oshima ahead of time

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:35.720
we avoided further casualties

00:20:36.599 --> 00:20:37.920
I didn't send him

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.400
He went on his own

00:20:40.279 --> 00:20:41.680
But since he got you out of trouble

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.519
I won't hold him accountable

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:45.759
Let's go, let's see the wounded

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.400
Halt

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.839
Colonel Wumu

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.599
Has Colonel Wumu returned?

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.880
Excuse me, has Colonel Wumu returned?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:20.359
Don't move

00:21:20.359 --> 00:21:21.240
Let me in

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:21.680
Step back

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.400
Let me go in and see

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.079
Step back

00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:23.519
I'm going to see

00:21:23.519 --> 00:21:24.880
Has Colonel Wumu returned?

00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:26.720
Step back

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.880
Is he injured?

00:21:28.519 --> 00:21:29.119
Just let me in

00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:30.039
Go announce me

00:21:30.759 --> 00:21:31.839
Let me in, please

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:32.920
Step back

00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:37.680
Wumu

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.000
Attention

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.079
At ease, carry on

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.559
Yes, sir

00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:00.640
Colonel

00:22:01.359 --> 00:22:03.359
That woman of yours is shouting outside

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.000
She seems very worried about you

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.839
Go take a look

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.000
General

00:22:10.359 --> 00:22:12.880
These men were injured because of my investigation

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.759
I wish to accompany the General

00:22:14.759 --> 00:22:16.759
to encourage and comfort them

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.960
Very well

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.480
Go to the hospital gate

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.480
Bring the Colonel's woman inside

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.279
Tell her the Colonel is fine

00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:25.680
Tell her not to worry

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.640
Yes, sir

00:22:31.799 --> 00:22:33.079
Do not approach

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.200
Back off

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.279
Guard Commander

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.680
The Colonel is waiting for you inside

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.680
This way, please

00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:45.039
Please

00:22:56.039 --> 00:22:57.400
The Colonel is fine, please rest assured

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.640
He is accompanying the General to visit the wounded

00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.720
Sakamoto

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:01.799
The injuries here are quite severe

00:23:01.799 --> 00:23:03.079
Please take a look

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.640
Over here

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.160
Are there any wounded in this ward?

00:25:40.119 --> 00:25:41.319
Commander.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.200
The wounded from the Anti-Aircraft Squadron

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.240
should all be gathered over there.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.519
This shouldn't be one of them.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.240
Which department sent this one?

00:25:59.359 --> 00:26:02.359
Hey, Commander Fujita is asking you a question.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.599
Excellency.

00:26:03.599 --> 00:26:05.359
This guy went to the village looking for women.

00:26:05.359 --> 00:26:07.079
Someone broke every bone in his body.

00:26:07.079 --> 00:26:08.240
His mouth was smashed too.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.519
So he can't speak.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.400
Why give him a private ward?

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.319
This is...

00:26:12.319 --> 00:26:13.720
Doctor Ozu's arrangement.

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:15.079
Call Ozu here.

00:26:15.079 --> 00:26:16.480
Commander.

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:18.200
The most important thing right now is...

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.240
the wounded from the Anti-Aircraft Squadron.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.680
They need the best medicine.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.319
Rest assured about that.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.759
I will call the Navy Department personally.

00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:26.640
Right now, you immediately...

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.279
go list a detailed inventory of medicines.

00:26:28.279 --> 00:26:28.880
Go.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.039
Yes, Colonel.

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.480
Sakamoto.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:36.960
Here.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.519
Tell Ozu...

00:26:38.519 --> 00:26:39.640
to move this guy out of the ward as soon as possible.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.279
Yes, sir.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.279
Akino.

00:26:53.599 --> 00:26:54.279
Yes, sir.

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:56.599
Write me a report on today's events.

00:26:56.599 --> 00:26:57.319
Yes, sir.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:01.920
Colonel.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.519
Let my car take you back.

00:27:03.519 --> 00:27:04.559
You've worked hard today.

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:05.880
And you've sustained some injuries.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.759
Go back and rest early.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.480
Commander.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.200
With so many casualties in the Anti-Aircraft Squadron today,

00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:13.920
I'd like to take a walk alone.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.480
Casualties are normal in wartime.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.640
Don't take it to heart.

00:27:18.119 --> 00:27:18.839
Yes, sir.

00:27:20.359 --> 00:27:22.519
I just remembered someone is waiting for you.

00:27:23.359 --> 00:27:24.599
Then suit yourself.

00:28:15.359 --> 00:28:15.880
Sorry, Colonel.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.599
Get out.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.799
Watch the outside, don't let anyone in.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:19.960
Yes, sir.

00:28:32.079 --> 00:28:33.559
The mission failed.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.039
The item wasn't delivered.

00:28:40.079 --> 00:28:41.480
The item can be sent again.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.000
As long as you're safe.

00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:54.960
How is the injury?

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.599
Why did they bandage you like this?

00:28:59.559 --> 00:29:00.319
No...

00:29:00.319 --> 00:29:02.039
Didn't you say you'd come back safe?

00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:03.920
That you'd take good care of yourself?

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.519
The bullet meant for you hasn't...

00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:07.359
hasn't been made yet, right?

00:29:21.519 --> 00:29:22.640
That was great.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.599
Great acting.

00:29:30.279 --> 00:29:31.680
You acted really well.

00:29:33.319 --> 00:29:33.920
You know what?

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:34.759
Since I've known you,

00:29:34.759 --> 00:29:36.400
that was the best performance you've given.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.880
But you don't have to act now.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:43.920
I have someone watching the door.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.119
No one will come in.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.960
When I was at Huangyang Mountain,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:04.920
Oshima Hiroshi suddenly led men...

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.200
and appeared behind me.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.480
I was completely off guard.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.960
There was no warning at all beforehand?

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.559
None.

00:30:20.079 --> 00:30:20.920
This man...

00:30:21.559 --> 00:30:22.559
is truly terrifying.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.039
I haven't met someone this troublesome in a long time.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.359
Will we be in danger?

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.759
We just need to be extra careful.

00:30:38.599 --> 00:30:39.480
Then...

00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:41.920
what's next?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.519
What do we do next?

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.279
I'll dress the wound briefly,

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.599
then I'll take you home.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.400
Okay.

00:31:28.039 --> 00:31:29.759
I think this time

00:31:29.759 --> 00:31:32.240
we finally taught a lesson to

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.640
that arrogant guy from the Palace.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.039
Is that so?

00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:38.759
This Colonel

00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:40.160
is just a

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.480
guy who only knows flashy moves.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.640
He doesn't know how to fight at all.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.200
From the Rong Agency in Macau,

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.799
we got news that a mysterious figure from Juntong

00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:52.480
was rushing back to Zhongshan.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.359
At this exact time, Colonel Wumu

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.519
also led men into Zhongshan territory.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.240
And then there was

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.279
the encounter at the crash site on Mount Huangyang.

00:32:06.039 --> 00:32:10.160
It really is too much of a coincidence.

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:12.319
A coincidence?

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.559
I suspect

00:32:15.559 --> 00:32:17.079
that regarding this attack,

00:32:17.079 --> 00:32:20.839
the other side definitely got intelligence beforehand.

00:32:25.119 --> 00:32:27.279
The news was leaked.

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:29.400
That is possible.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:32.960
Inoue,

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.839
have Sasaki

00:32:34.839 --> 00:32:36.519
go to the Headquarters telecommunications room.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.200
See what Colonel Wumu, before this operation,

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.319
sent in his telegrams.

00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:42.279
Find out quietly.

00:32:42.559 --> 00:32:44.160
Do not alert the Commander.

00:32:45.279 --> 00:32:46.599
I understand.

00:32:48.839 --> 00:32:49.799
After that is done,

00:32:52.279 --> 00:32:52.920
after that is done,

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.480
come to my office for a meeting together.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.160
Yes, sir.

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:23.039
Elder De,

00:34:23.519 --> 00:34:24.480
early this morning,

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.239
the Police Battalion sent people to register,

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:28.320
saying they need to verify

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.639
the boats and the number of people going to sea.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:34.679
I've been feeling very uneasy.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.400
Translator Luo hasn't returned yet,

00:34:37.039 --> 00:34:37.920
so I had to

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.840
come here to ask for your advice

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.360
on what to do.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.800
This is the

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.119
list drawn up by the Police Battalion.

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:50.519
There are 261 people in total.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.679
Why is Xia also on this list?

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:58.199
He doesn't know how to fish.

00:34:58.199 --> 00:34:59.039
Also,

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.199
these few,

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:02.880
these few kids don't know how to fish either.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.239
Why are they all in here?

00:35:04.519 --> 00:35:06.559
This is what Oshima Hiroshi,

00:35:07.079 --> 00:35:08.039
based on the island's

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:10.159
young and strong laborers, drew up.

00:35:11.719 --> 00:35:12.920
But Elder De,

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.360
there is something I find quite strange.

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:18.719
Going to sea in mid-April,

00:35:18.719 --> 00:35:20.880
isn't it a bit too early now?

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.480
This matter,

00:35:23.199 --> 00:35:25.000
are you also the one convening it?

00:35:30.239 --> 00:35:31.360
Bingchen,

00:35:33.639 --> 00:35:35.039
I know you.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.119
You originally wanted to be a gentleman,

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.360
but were confused by the external environment,

00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:43.760
and were used by the Japanese.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.000
Now,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
you've been labeled a bad person by the villagers.

00:35:52.519 --> 00:35:54.360
A good man is like fine timber;

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.639
a gentleman is like unpolished jade.

00:35:57.239 --> 00:35:59.119
It must be carefully carved

00:35:59.559 --> 00:36:01.679
to gain the villagers' approval.

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:04.159
I understand.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.800
As for this matter of going to sea,

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.119
on the surface, it looks like

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.559
a good thing,

00:36:09.559 --> 00:36:10.559
with no problems.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.679
But I feel

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.960
we should still be cautious.

00:36:15.519 --> 00:36:17.320
The Japanese are not that simple.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.400
You should delay this matter for now.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.239
Wait until Translator Luo comes back,

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.920
then sound things out again

00:36:24.159 --> 00:36:25.039
before making a final decision.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.760
Okay.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.280
Bingchen,

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.239
rectify your heart,

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.360
have a clear conscience before heaven and earth,

00:36:36.679 --> 00:36:37.960
and before your ancestors.

00:36:39.199 --> 00:36:40.599
You and I should both be like this.

00:36:42.239 --> 00:36:43.119
Elder De,

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.079
I understand.

00:36:46.239 --> 00:36:48.920
I will take my leave now.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.320
Please.

00:37:36.719 --> 00:37:37.639
Where are you going?

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:38.480
Xiang'er.

00:37:38.679 --> 00:37:39.280
Xiang'er.

00:37:39.679 --> 00:37:40.920
Boss is here.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.519
Do you know where to send it?

00:37:42.519 --> 00:37:43.920
I know. I'll send it to you in a bit.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:44.679
Go.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.039
Boss.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.920
Boss.

00:37:48.159 --> 00:37:49.400
Long time no see.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.599
Where have you been?

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.840
Aren't I here to see you now?

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.000
Honestly.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.159
I've been waiting for you for ages.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.000
Room 3, occupied.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.880
Guest for Room 4, please come in.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.079
Room 4.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.480
Room 4, two mace of opium.

00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:19.599
Room 5, occupied.

00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:21.639
Guest for Room 6, please come in.

00:38:21.639 --> 00:38:22.280
Baihe.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:22.960
Coming!

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.039
Room 6.

00:38:24.039 --> 00:38:26.400
Room 6, three mace of opium.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.719
Coming.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.199
Who are you people?

00:38:43.079 --> 00:38:44.960
Let me go! Let me go!

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.360
Japanese, huh?

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.360
You've got the wrong person.

00:38:54.119 --> 00:38:55.239
Get out.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.119
This IOU from Yongli Casino is yours, right?

00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:08.079
So what if it is?

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.199
Then Boss, you are exactly who we're looking for.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.159
Now this IOU is in our possession.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.760
Mr. Rong gave orders.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.800
Either we take the money back today,

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.320
or we take one of your hands.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.599
Choose for yourself.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.119
Do it.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.280
What?

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.159
Don't like this one?

00:39:38.199 --> 00:39:38.920
Fine.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.679
Switch to the other one.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.360
Boss.

00:39:47.519 --> 00:39:50.559
I hear you have six concubines at home.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.199
Each one more beautiful than the last.

00:39:58.079 --> 00:39:59.480
Let me go!

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.800
This girl isn't bad either.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.840
Shoot her.

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:14.360
And we're even.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.920
No rush.

00:40:23.239 --> 00:40:24.760
Room 2, occupied.

00:40:25.079 --> 00:40:26.800
Guest for Room 7, please come in.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.519
Please come in.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.920
Screw you.

00:40:31.199 --> 00:40:32.039
Let go.

00:40:32.039 --> 00:40:34.039
If you have the guts, just shoot me.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.119
Boss.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.360
You should recognize this little thing.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.639
It seems to be your own kind.

00:40:45.239 --> 00:40:46.679
If you have something to say, say it.

00:40:48.239 --> 00:40:50.199
The matter I mentioned earlier...

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.920
have you thought it over?

00:40:54.519 --> 00:40:55.719
Get lost.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.320
What are you doing?

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:14.880
What are you doing?

00:41:15.679 --> 00:41:16.559
Let go.

00:41:18.079 --> 00:41:18.920
Boss.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.280
You even strip a man's clothes?

00:41:20.559 --> 00:41:23.199
I heard rats like to dig holes.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.480
I want you to help me test...

00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:37.559
whether this little rat...

00:41:38.639 --> 00:41:40.280
will bite through this iron bucket...

00:41:45.079 --> 00:41:46.280
or...

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.320
if it prefers to bite through the belly of a big rat like you.

00:41:51.239 --> 00:41:52.360
You little Japs!

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:54.480
I'll fuck your ancestors to the eighteenth generation!

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.480
Fuck your ancestors!

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.559
Let go! Let go!

00:42:05.559 --> 00:42:06.800
Let go! Let go!

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.840
Let me go!

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.719
Let go! Let go!

00:42:20.559 --> 00:42:22.079
I agree!

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.280
I agree!
