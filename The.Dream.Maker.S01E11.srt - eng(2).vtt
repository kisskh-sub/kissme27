What happened?

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:47.779
Mr. Tan, I'm here!

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:49.139
Mr. Tan!

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.136
Fatty!

Quiet down! What's all this?

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.620
Mr. Tan, we're here to pay.

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:03.620
You register it.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.980
We're first in line, right?

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.059
By the rule,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.459
the first to pay will get Binhai Road!

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.019
Listen, Binhai Road is reserved
for county-level cadres.

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:12.619
What are you doing?

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:13.419
To pay!

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.459
This is ridiculous.

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:17.304
We've signed the letter of intent.

Fatty. What?

00:02:21.624 --> 00:02:22.340
- Mr. Xie.
- Calm down!

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.859
Yes.

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:23.736
- Come to me.
- Be patient.

00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:24.500
I can help you.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.060
What?

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.899
Get out of here.

No, Mr. Xie.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.980
You gave it up?

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:29.859
No!

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:30.699
Talk to you later.

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:31.579
- Leave.
- No!

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:32.380
Go home!

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.179
Fatty!

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.500
Listen. Don't be superstitious.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.340
Leave now!

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:38.680

- Great enthusiasm!

It's just a minor incident.

- Don't worry.
- It's fine.

00:02:44.312 --> 00:02:45.464
You handle it first.

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:47.899
Leave the prime locations for them.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.899
We're here specifically for Binhai Road.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.060
We want Binhai Road, right?

00:02:51.064 --> 00:02:51.820
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.459
Calm down!

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.299

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.899

Leave!

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.980
Listen.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.019
Let me tell you.

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.419
Even if you pay, he can't accept it.

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:01.459
Why not?

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.820
Because we already signed
the letter of intent. You know?

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:05.540
Binhai Road

00:03:05.688 --> 00:03:06.648
- is already ours.
- Letter of intent?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.864
By the rule,

00:03:07.864 --> 00:03:09.619
- the first to pay gets it. Right?
- Listen.

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:10.859
We came to pay first.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.019
Right?

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.464

- First-come, first-served.

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:14.179
No problem.

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:15.299

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.899
- Stop shouting!
- Yes.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.419

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.540
What?

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:19.739
Stop arguing here.

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:20.940
Just go home.

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:21.699

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.739
No need to know.

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:23.980
Don't act like a hooligan.

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:25.459
A hooligan?

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:26.340

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:27.820
Stop!

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.380
Stop arguing.

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.100
What's wrong with Fatty?

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:35.579
I told him to wait for news.
He's so impulsive.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.899
He spoiled the whole plan.

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:37.859
Exactly.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.780
Don't worry. I won't.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.739
Good. I trust you.

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.019
It's fine.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.060
Stop fighting! Stop!

or it'll cause trouble.

Yes.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.619
Fatty, this is the government office.

00:04:17.619 --> 00:04:18.540
Get them out of here.

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:20.179
- We can talk later.
- We're here to pay.

Step aside.

Fatty, listen to me.

I don't care who you were.

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:29.619
But today, you need to behave.

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:30.499
You yelled at me?

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.179
Come.

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:32.460
- Don't scold him!
- Mind your manners!

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.859
Yes.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.259

I can't find the official seal.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.700
- Wait!
- What's going on?

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.660
Official seal?

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:26.540
- What a hassle!
- Decheng.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.220
Ms. Dan!

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.540
- Ms. Dan!
- Zheng Decheng!

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:29.819
What are you up to?

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.980
Calm down. There was
indeed a situation today.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.059
We'll handle it.

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:35.700
No matter what,
I'll take full responsibility for you.

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:38.220
Give us half an hour, alright?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.859
I'll handle it soon.

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:41.939
I don't trust anyone.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.460
I only trust you, Qiuping.

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:49.499
Half an hour? I'll have everyone wait.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.419
Thanks, Ms. Dan. Just half an hour.

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:53.299
Look.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.304
(Please Conserve Water)

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.299
This one's free.

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:11.259
Try it. It's free.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.059
Is it tasty?

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:12.939
(Dried Goods)
Try this.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.059
I'll help myself.

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:14.700
Eat this.

00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:15.580
Hurry up!

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.259
Yes, the heat's a bit low.

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:20.020
This pot is ready.

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:21.059
I'll call you later.

00:07:21.299 --> 00:07:22.259
Go and sit for a while.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.179
Local specialty!

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.700
No, thanks.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.980
Thank you.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.059
Thank you.

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:32.020
Let's wait.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.619
Take it easy. They will explain.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.340
Just wait for their solution.

00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:46.980
That's the situation.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.780
So I've decided

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.259
to give Binhai Road
to the self-employed individuals.

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:54.580
Are you kidding?

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.220
What about the cadres?

00:07:56.379 --> 00:07:58.499
Mr. Zheng, don't be reckless.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.859
They've signed the agreement.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.939
I know.
I'll take responsibility for this.

00:08:03.179 --> 00:08:04.780
I met the investor with them.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.179
I didn't tell you all immediately

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.859
because it wasn't finalized yet.

00:08:09.179 --> 00:08:12.140
Never expect that Xuemei and the others
would sign the contract so fast.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:13.220
Gao Xuemei!

00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:16.540
Hold on! Don't get worked up.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:17.939
Xuemei isn't wrong.

00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:19.379
She's doing it all for Yuehai.

00:08:22.859 --> 00:08:24.140
Okay, everyone.

00:08:24.299 --> 00:08:25.540
Lower your voices!

00:08:27.419 --> 00:08:29.299
Mr. Zheng,
I'm holding back my temper to talk.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.900
Gao Xuemei is my wife.

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:32.739
I know exactly what she's thinking.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.700
I'll talk to her later.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.248
You, as Secretary,

00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:38.019
can't be as reckless as her.

00:08:38.259 --> 00:08:39.180
X-Xie.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.940
He isn't being reckless.

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:42.820
His purpose is to protect the interests

00:08:43.019 --> 00:08:44.779
of the self-employed individuals.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.420
We all understand that, right?

00:08:46.539 --> 00:08:47.180
But Mr. Zheng,

00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:48.060
what about

00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:50.499
the thousands of county cadres?

00:08:51.192 --> 00:08:52.379
There are dozens downstairs!

00:08:52.739 --> 00:08:53.859
What should we do right now?

00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:02.980
Lin, you never speak,
but now you need to take a stance.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.739
Say something. Come on.

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:09.580
First-come, first-served.

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:12.539
Just give the land
to those you promised first.

00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:13.619
Exactly!

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:14.460
Lin Tofu is right!

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.779
Let me translate what he means.

00:09:17.019 --> 00:09:18.779
He's saying you're just acting on whims.

00:09:31.899 --> 00:09:32.539
Ms. Li,

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:35.960
you invited those cadres

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.019
to settle in Yuehai, right?

00:09:38.259 --> 00:09:41.180
Can you imagine if they hear this news?
Won't they blow up?

00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:43.139
Aren't you responsible?

00:09:58.499 --> 00:10:00.580
Yes, we are responsible for them.

00:10:04.379 --> 00:10:06.499
How do you all still have the appetite?

00:10:06.499 --> 00:10:07.259
Are you happy?

00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:08.180
Thanks.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:08.820
What's wrong?

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.619
Do you all not know?

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.220
We've all been deceived
by Zheng Decheng.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.019
That can't be.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.180
I know him very well.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.060
He is very cunning.

00:10:18.859 --> 00:10:19.619
No way.

00:10:19.659 --> 00:10:21.180
Otherwise, why are we

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.259
waiting for him?

00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:22.899
Mr. Wang.

00:10:24.779 --> 00:10:25.779
Don't say that.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:29.912
What did I say?

00:10:29.912 --> 00:10:31.480
Decheng isn't that kind of person.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.019
Who knows if you and Zheng Decheng

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.139
are putting on an act together?

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.619
What do you mean by that?

00:10:41.259 --> 00:10:43.340
Ms. Liu, have something to eat.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:43.980
I'm not hungry.

00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:49.859
Thank you.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.139
You're welcome.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:01.859
Listen, Li.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.619
I want to give Binhai Road
to the self-employed individuals

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.499
because I want
to turn the printing street

00:11:07.739 --> 00:11:09.460
into Yuehai's...

00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:11.940
What is it called again?

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.060
Well...

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.100
You said it yourself
during the campaign.

00:11:15.379 --> 00:11:16.420
For a city to develop,

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.700
it needs to have its own...

00:11:19.019 --> 00:11:20.859
I'm getting flustered and forgot.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.980
What is it again?

00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:23.544
What industry?

00:11:23.544 --> 00:11:24.379
Printing industry.

00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:26.499
What else? You can't even articulate it.

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:27.580
You shut up!

00:11:27.859 --> 00:11:29.379
What industry?

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.379
Pillar industry.

00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:31.256
Exactly.

00:11:31.739 --> 00:11:33.300
For a city to thrive,

00:11:33.739 --> 00:11:36.539
it must build its own
pillar industry. Right?

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.940
Mr. Zheng, if we offend the cadres,

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.259
how would we
carry out our work moving forward?

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:45.980
I'm not afraid.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.379
I've been a grassroots cadre
for many years.

00:11:49.496 --> 00:11:50.488
I've offended people.

00:11:50.619 --> 00:11:52.019
A few more won't make a difference.

00:11:52.259 --> 00:11:54.980
No matter what happens,
I'll take full responsibility. Alright?

00:11:55.259 --> 00:11:56.259
Only you?

00:11:56.499 --> 00:11:57.899
All of us can be responsible!

00:11:58.139 --> 00:11:59.859
Those who can't be won't be
in this room.

00:11:59.899 --> 00:12:00.619
Enough.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.259
This isn't just
about taking responsibility.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.980
Since we can't reach a consensus,

00:12:05.139 --> 00:12:06.060
we'll take a vote.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:06.820
What do you say?

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:07.659
Okay. Vote.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.539
Vote.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.820
Those in favor of giving Binhai Road

00:12:12.139 --> 00:12:14.460
to the self-employed individuals,
please raise your hands.

00:12:30.859 --> 00:12:31.420
Well, I...

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.980
I vote yes.

00:12:40.499 --> 00:12:41.019
Wait.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.499
M-Ms. Li, are you serious?

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.160
I invited these cadres here.
I'll go out and address them.

00:12:47.779 --> 00:12:48.940
No, wait a moment.

00:12:49.619 --> 00:12:50.180
Sit down.

00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:52.460
It's not over yet.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.499
Sit down.

00:12:54.859 --> 00:12:55.420
Sit.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.340
Two votes.

00:13:03.859 --> 00:13:05.580
Two votes in favor. Correct?

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:06.899
You two voted for it.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.539
Against? Three votes.

00:13:09.859 --> 00:13:11.779
The three of us voted no.

00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:13.420
Three votes. Three to two.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.820
Three to two.
So it still goes to the cadres.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:18.619
Exactly.

00:13:26.899 --> 00:13:27.460
That's fair.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.060
Well,

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:30.659
fair enough.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.019
Acceptable.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.739
As key leading cadres
of the town government,

00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:38.648
you've cast your valuable votes.

00:13:38.648 --> 00:13:40.019
You did what you think is right.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.060
Fair enough.

00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:44.060
Tan, the voting tally is

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.499
one yeas to four nays.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.019
Ms. Li also voted no. Okay?

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.700
Impossible. I'm being objective here.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:50.899
My decision stands.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:52.619
I'll take responsibility.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.220
Regardless, I am the Secretary
of the town Party committee.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.980
I'll bear the consequences
for any incident.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.232
What?

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.060
What are you doing?

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:05.739
I told you.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:06.619
What are you doing?

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.739
I'll take responsibility for anything.

00:14:09.539 --> 00:14:10.100
Open the door.

00:14:12.619 --> 00:14:13.460
Mr. Zheng.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.499
Mr. Lin, open the door quickly.

00:14:15.659 --> 00:14:17.060
Mr. Zheng will cause trouble.

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:23.259
Zheng Decheng, let's proceed.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.300
Everyone.

00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:25.980
Let's all take a short break. Okay?

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.980
- Take a break.
- Ms. Liu.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.820
A word in private?

00:14:28.379 --> 00:14:29.460
Get everyone some water.

00:14:29.739 --> 00:14:30.460
We're not thirsty.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.352
Restrooms, over there.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.539
Come, Ms. Liu.

00:14:34.619 --> 00:14:35.256
You...

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.539
Come.

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:41.460
Wait outside.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.460
Go ahead.

00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:51.300
I'll be direct then.

00:14:52.779 --> 00:14:53.300
Ms. Liu.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.619
I'll give the Binhai Road
to the self-employed individuals

00:14:57.112 --> 00:14:58.220
to build a printing street.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.139
Fine. I won't argue with you.

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:11.704
I'll talk to Li Qiuping.

00:15:11.704 --> 00:15:13.259
She won't help.

00:15:13.619 --> 00:15:15.220
This isn't her call. It's mine.

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:16.700
Alright? Settled.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:23.659
How did it go?

00:15:23.739 --> 00:15:24.899
Mr. Lin, can you open it?

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.180
I can't. It's locked from the outside.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.619
Unless I break it.

00:15:29.619 --> 00:15:30.499
Just kick it down.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.220
Kick it?

00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:31.820
No.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.539
Ms. Li.

00:15:36.659 --> 00:15:37.340
Ms. Li.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.499
- Step aside.
- Sorry.

00:15:38.499 --> 00:15:39.420
- Move aside.
- Stop it!

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.499
- Don't.
- Step aside.

00:15:40.499 --> 00:15:41.100
Tan, move!

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:41.700
Listen to her.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:43.096
Do whatever she says.

00:15:43.096 --> 00:15:44.340
She does whatever she wants.

00:15:44.379 --> 00:15:45.259
Anything!

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:48.499
- Mr. Xie, what do you mean by that?
- Make a big fuss!

00:15:48.499 --> 00:15:49.580
- Mr. Zheng was right.
- Make a big fuss!

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.659
Yuehai must develop pillar industries.

00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:52.820
- Mr. Tan.
- Move!

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.379
Kick it down.

00:15:54.499 --> 00:15:55.100
Move aside!

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.460
Move aside! Don't stop him!

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.580
If you keep doing this,
Mr. Zheng will cause big trouble.

00:15:59.619 --> 00:16:00.820
So I'm being unreasonable?

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.619
You think I can't deal with you?

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.300
Who signed this with me?

00:16:06.019 --> 00:16:06.980
It's in black and white.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.220
Your name, Zheng Decheng, is on it.

00:16:09.379 --> 00:16:10.460
Take a look for yourself!

00:16:10.539 --> 00:16:11.180
Did I sign this?

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:11.980
You think?

00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:13.340
Zheng Decheng!

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.700
Zheng Decheng!

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.820
Zheng Decheng!

(Yuehai Town Master Plan)

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.220
Get in the bus!

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:35.019
Get in the bus with me.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.300
Get in!

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.259
Get in!

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:38.100
Go!

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:38.980
Get in!

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.139
Ms. Liu!

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.180
Get in!

00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:42.659
Go back with her.

00:16:43.019 --> 00:16:43.580
Ms. Liu!

00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:46.379
Hurry! Get out!

00:16:46.424 --> 00:16:47.180
Okay.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.139
- Go back!
- Okay.

00:16:49.899 --> 00:16:51.220
Mr. Zheng, are you okay?

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.340
Don't swallow it! Spit it out!

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:54.980
Go see them off.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.059
See you, comrades!

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.220
Thank you for today.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.819
That's okay. Go back.

00:17:13.059 --> 00:17:13.819
Go back.

00:17:14.019 --> 00:17:14.860
Goodbye!

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.120
Bye.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:23.224
Wait!

00:17:43.499 --> 00:17:44.059
I don't care.

00:17:44.579 --> 00:17:46.860
You have to build another road
beside it.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:47.779
Hold on.

00:17:47.779 --> 00:17:49.460
Is this the time to talk about the road?

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.579
You just offended all the cadres,
didn't you?

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.420
What did you say to them?

00:17:55.779 --> 00:17:56.620
What could I say?

00:17:56.952 --> 00:17:59.339
I said I gave Binhai Road
to the self-employed individuals.

00:17:59.339 --> 00:18:00.220
I let them go.

00:18:00.539 --> 00:18:01.220
What?

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.299
The letter of intent!

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.579
It was signed! I told you!

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:04.499
The letter?

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.072
I ate it.

00:18:13.299 --> 00:18:15.900
Mr. Zheng,
I fully support your decision.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.140
But the way you handled this matter...

00:18:18.259 --> 00:18:19.900
It's rough yet effective. Astonishing.

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:21.980
Effective? How so?

00:18:22.259 --> 00:18:23.259
He drove the cadres away!

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.299
Can't you see that?

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.940
You handled it in a rough way.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.380
It can't solve the problem.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.059
It also intensified the conflict
between the two parties!

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:35.660
Now we must find a strong solution,

00:18:36.059 --> 00:18:37.539
or we can't explain to Liu Dan.

00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:39.579
Nor to those cadres.

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:42.339
Yes, true.

00:18:43.499 --> 00:18:46.180
I accept everyone's criticism.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.940
I acted impulsively on this matter.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.019
I'll take full responsibility
for all consequences. Okay?

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.539
It's not about responsibility.

00:18:54.539 --> 00:18:56.539
We need to figure out a solution, right?

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.460
Mr. Zheng, you just suggested

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.940
building another road
just like Binhai Road?

00:19:02.059 --> 00:19:03.980
Yes! And preferably, right next to it.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.220
Find another spot
and build another road.

00:19:06.936 --> 00:19:08.184
(Yuehai Town Master Plan)
Good idea!

00:19:08.184 --> 00:19:10.180
It's still not too late to act.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.380
Good idea.

00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:12.980
This is Binhai Road.

00:19:13.624 --> 00:19:14.712
Starting from here.

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:15.704
It works.

00:19:15.704 --> 00:19:17.420
This road looks good. Not bad.

00:19:17.499 --> 00:19:20.660
We need to open up passages
here, here, and here.

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:22.819
It will be a big project.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.779
(Super Dog Restaurant)

00:19:44.779 --> 00:19:45.940
Let me state this upfront.

00:19:47.339 --> 00:19:49.940
I won't be involved in this thing.

00:19:52.019 --> 00:19:53.900
Very slippery of you!

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.579
Everyone was right about you.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.460
See?

00:19:56.739 --> 00:19:58.616
When trouble comes,
you just give up first.

00:19:58.616 --> 00:20:00.259
You're easily swayed.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.539
I'm slippery?

00:20:03.299 --> 00:20:05.259
Commoners never fight officials.

00:20:05.339 --> 00:20:06.700
Don't you understand?

00:20:07.819 --> 00:20:09.739
I'm thinking
of the development of Yuehai.

00:20:10.259 --> 00:20:12.420
I'm not causing trouble for Yuehai.

00:20:15.259 --> 00:20:16.152
No.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.040
I can't give up.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.420
All these years, I've pleased people

00:20:20.539 --> 00:20:22.539
and suffered a lot

00:20:22.739 --> 00:20:24.059
to secure so many orders.

00:20:24.339 --> 00:20:25.460
I've drunk too much alcohol.

00:20:26.019 --> 00:20:27.220
I've been waiting for this.

00:20:27.579 --> 00:20:29.900
I just want to be a first-mover.

00:20:30.579 --> 00:20:32.460
Right now, very soon,

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:34.860
we'll have our own printing street.

00:20:35.259 --> 00:20:37.299
Very soon,
the initiative will be in our hands.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.579
Very soon, we'll be a first-mover.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.700
We absolutely can't back down now.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.900
Besides,

00:20:44.339 --> 00:20:45.860
Mr. Zheng trusts us and supports us.

00:20:46.499 --> 00:20:47.460
I trust Mr. Zheng.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.739
Mr. Zheng is on our side.

00:20:52.539 --> 00:20:55.259
But that doesn't mean
he can make this happen.

00:20:56.019 --> 00:20:56.779
Think about it.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.019
Mr. Zheng supports us,

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:02.180
which means offending thousands
of cadres.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.499
Consider how severe
the consequences could be!

00:21:09.099 --> 00:21:11.299
In that case, Yuehai won't get built.

00:21:11.499 --> 00:21:13.819
Forget about building a printing street.

00:21:14.299 --> 00:21:16.980
As long as Mr. Zheng is here,
Yuehai will thrive.

00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:21.339
Once we secure his support,

00:21:23.019 --> 00:21:24.579
we'll get Binhai Road.

00:21:26.019 --> 00:21:28.259
Changyuan, don't act recklessly!

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.739
Don't just think about rejecting me.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.380
Xuemei, won't you say something?

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:35.700
What are your thoughts, Xuemei?

00:21:36.259 --> 00:21:38.779
I understand if anyone wants to quit.

00:21:39.019 --> 00:21:40.620
Besides, Guo makes a valid point.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.819
Mr. Zheng offended leadership for us,

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.860
which means the entire Yuehai

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.019
has offended leadership.

00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:47.860
Yes.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.579
Moreover, it'll have awful repercussions

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.420
on Xie and my family.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.259
Xuemei, what do you mean?

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.980
Are you quitting too?

00:22:06.059 --> 00:22:06.900
I have no choice.

00:22:07.339 --> 00:22:08.259
There is no retreat.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.700
If we keep going,

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.059
we might still fail.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.779
But if we don't try,

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.579
we'll never build a printing street.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.259
And we'll inevitably lose money, right?

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:21.860
Have some.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.620
I won't turn tail and run.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.259
Fine, discuss it among yourselves.

00:22:29.624 --> 00:22:31.064
I'm going home for something else.

00:22:33.499 --> 00:22:35.940
Changyuan, let me warn you again.

00:22:36.339 --> 00:22:38.220
Don't act impulsively or foolishly.

00:22:39.259 --> 00:22:39.860
Understood.

00:22:53.624 --> 00:22:54.299
(Win)

00:22:54.299 --> 00:22:54.900
Let's do it.

00:22:55.288 --> 00:22:57.496
This man has high standards.

00:22:57.496 --> 00:22:58.744
Exceptionally strict.

00:22:58.744 --> 00:23:00.019
He pays more for high quality.

00:23:00.019 --> 00:23:01.976
- Why are you here? Move!
- Mr. Xie.

00:23:02.616 --> 00:23:04.504
I'll talk it over with him properly.

00:23:06.712 --> 00:23:08.216
We'll do our best.

00:23:21.539 --> 00:23:22.220
Gao Xuemei!

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.299
Gao Xuemei!

00:23:29.539 --> 00:23:30.099
Out of my way!

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:39.539
Your mom?

00:23:42.739 --> 00:23:44.539
Xie, what's wrong?

00:23:49.339 --> 00:23:50.019
You...

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.339
When did you learn to lie?

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.220
You said
you went to Nanzhou for supplies.

00:24:02.579 --> 00:24:03.339
What supplies?

00:24:03.339 --> 00:24:03.980
I...

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.180
What did you get?

00:24:05.299 --> 00:24:05.940
I was wrong.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.220
To be specific!

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.059
You worked with the investor
to deceive me, didn't you?

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.339
No, Xie.

00:24:11.339 --> 00:24:13.059
I admit I didn't think this through.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.860
I should have discussed it
with you first.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:15.460
Gao Xuemei!

00:24:15.539 --> 00:24:18.299
I didn't see this coming.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.460
What your mom did

00:24:22.779 --> 00:24:24.739
caused big trouble for Yuehai.

00:24:24.739 --> 00:24:26.180
Very big trouble!

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.059
No matter what you did before,

00:24:37.259 --> 00:24:39.700
withdraw immediately. Right now!

00:24:39.739 --> 00:24:40.440
Okay.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.339
We only have one factory.

00:24:44.059 --> 00:24:44.900
Are you ruining it?

00:24:45.099 --> 00:24:46.180
No, I am not.

00:24:46.259 --> 00:24:48.739
Don't turn the pillar industry
into a stupid one.

00:24:48.819 --> 00:24:49.579
Use your head.

00:24:49.739 --> 00:24:50.860
Please, use your head!

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.779
Yes.

00:24:52.259 --> 00:24:54.460
Let others be pillars. You be a brick.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:55.800
Okay.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:58.539
Too sweet.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:24:59.779
Really?

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:02.620
Too sweet.

00:25:02.819 --> 00:25:04.220
You never listen to me.

00:25:04.299 --> 00:25:06.180
- You never listen to me.
- I never learn.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:07.460
You let those 'monkeys'...

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:09.380
I'm talking about you. Get out!

00:25:09.499 --> 00:25:10.140
Leave!

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:10.739
Leave!

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:11.940
Everyone, withdraw!

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.019
Don't participate.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.140
Withdraw, all of you.

00:25:17.019 --> 00:25:20.099
Xie, how could we possibly persuade them

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:20.940
about this?

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.579
Ultimately, Mr. Zheng
will decide on this matter.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.779
What does he think about it?

00:25:26.739 --> 00:25:27.739
Did you vote?

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.420
Let me tell you, today...

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:32.739
Why am I even telling you this?

00:25:33.499 --> 00:25:34.220
Stay out of this!

00:25:34.456 --> 00:25:35.320
Careful, it's hot!

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:43.700
Hello?

00:25:44.099 --> 00:25:45.299
Ms. Liu, you're home?

00:25:46.259 --> 00:25:47.420
About what happened today...

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.059
Qiuping.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.940
This matter has nothing
to do with you anymore.

00:25:53.579 --> 00:25:54.620
Tell Zheng Decheng.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.819
There's no turning back from this point.

00:25:57.299 --> 00:25:59.339
We are determined to get Binhai Road.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.420
A blackout?

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.059
Why?

00:26:33.339 --> 00:26:34.460
Sudden blackout. Why?

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.299
Who has candles?

00:26:35.864 --> 00:26:37.560
- Why is the power out?
- Who has candles?

00:26:38.499 --> 00:26:39.339
What's going on?

00:26:39.339 --> 00:26:40.420
Sudden blackout.

00:26:40.819 --> 00:26:41.620
Any candles?

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:42.620
Got any candles?

00:26:45.019 --> 00:26:45.940
What's happening?

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:46.980
Why is the power out?

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:47.980
What's going on?

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:48.739
Can't see a thing.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.019
Does anyone have candles?

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:51.819
No.

00:26:52.019 --> 00:26:53.019
Do you have any lights?

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:53.700
Any lights?

00:26:53.819 --> 00:26:54.739
Zhuang, any lights?

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:55.620
Any candles at home?

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.220
Yes.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:56.739
Yes.

00:26:56.819 --> 00:26:57.579
Lights coming!

00:26:57.579 --> 00:26:58.460
Lights coming!

00:27:02.099 --> 00:27:02.660
Mr. Zheng.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.059
What's the rush?

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.180
Take your time.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.620
It's dark inside.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:09.779
Go inside, Mr. Zheng.

00:27:09.779 --> 00:27:10.620
Where is he?

00:27:12.819 --> 00:27:13.940
What are you doing, Fatty?

00:27:14.539 --> 00:27:15.339
You...

00:27:15.339 --> 00:27:16.380
Changyuan is inside.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.019
Careful.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.579
You're crazy, acting all mysterious.

00:27:23.819 --> 00:27:24.460
Changyuan.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:27.900
Qian Changyuan.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.900
Mr. Zheng, I'm inside.

00:27:32.299 --> 00:27:32.940
Where?

00:27:35.059 --> 00:27:35.620
Inside.

00:27:38.499 --> 00:27:39.220
Qian Changyuan.

00:27:57.299 --> 00:27:58.900
What's wrong? Acting all mysterious.

00:28:01.579 --> 00:28:02.259
Mr. Zheng.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:03.739
Sorry

00:28:05.579 --> 00:28:06.460
to trouble you.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.180
Boss!

00:28:19.299 --> 00:28:20.980
Don't call her boss. Call her Ms. Gao.

00:28:22.299 --> 00:28:24.779
Ms. Gao, why was there no notice
about this blackout?

00:28:25.299 --> 00:28:26.900
How should I know?

00:28:27.339 --> 00:28:28.539
How are we supposed to work?

00:28:29.819 --> 00:28:31.860
You can ask me. I'm a town official.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.499
Well then, sir, why is the power out?

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.592
I'll go ask the town government.

00:28:43.739 --> 00:28:44.380
Finished?

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.739
Be careful with fire!
This is a printery.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.620
Don't worry.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.220
Hold on.

00:28:49.499 --> 00:28:50.900
Take a flashlight to light the way.

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:51.900
Take your time.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:53.700
Be careful.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.420
I need this to light my path ahead.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:05.819
Alas.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.220
You scared me!

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:15.980
Key.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:17.539
Safe.

00:29:31.579 --> 00:29:32.460
Don't want to give it?

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.059
Of course not. It belongs to you.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:38.940
See? You have more keys

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.019
than I do.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.259
I work for you.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.019
Is this the only key to the safe?

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:00.980
It's an unexpected blackout.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.660
Hello?

00:30:06.232 --> 00:30:06.744
Hello?

00:30:07.096 --> 00:30:08.632
Is this the Power Supply Bureau?

00:30:08.819 --> 00:30:10.019
This is Yuehai Town.

00:30:10.819 --> 00:30:13.180
I'd like to inquire about the reason
for the sudden blackout

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:13.860
in Yuehai.

00:30:14.072 --> 00:30:15.352
(Pingchuan Power Supply Bureau)

00:30:15.352 --> 00:30:16.460
It's a scheduled blackout.

00:30:17.539 --> 00:30:18.460
A scheduled blackout?

00:30:19.059 --> 00:30:20.620
According to the power usage standards,

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:23.739
we weren't scheduled
for a power outage today.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.180
I don't know about that.

00:30:26.779 --> 00:30:27.940
I'm just the on-duty staff.

00:30:28.299 --> 00:30:30.259
Call back tomorrow during office hours.

00:30:45.059 --> 00:30:45.819
What do you mean?

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.660
I heard

00:30:48.299 --> 00:30:50.180
the cadres
from both the town and the county

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.539
have signed the letter of intent.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.779
If you ask them to give up,

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:54.860
they won't agree.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.140
I totally understand.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.499
So, I want you

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.099
to help persuade them.

00:31:02.739 --> 00:31:04.620
See, there are so many people involved.

00:31:05.099 --> 00:31:06.579
There are many things to take care of

00:31:07.499 --> 00:31:09.420
and cost money, right?

00:31:11.499 --> 00:31:12.180
How much?

00:31:13.579 --> 00:31:14.299
50,000 yuan.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.499
50,000 yuan.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.660
It's already counted?

00:31:32.739 --> 00:31:33.380
Sure.

00:31:33.499 --> 00:31:34.099
500 yuan.

00:31:34.099 --> 00:31:34.660
Thank you.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.059
Ms. Li.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:39.059
Mom.

00:31:39.299 --> 00:31:40.620
- Ms. Li is here.
- Hello, Ms. Li.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:41.380
Hello.

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.099
Don't mind me.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.339
Ms. Li.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.180
Xuemei.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:46.700
This is...

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.539
They just started their businesses.

00:31:49.539 --> 00:31:50.739
They're not established yet.

00:31:51.019 --> 00:31:52.120
They trust me,

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.784
so they use my account for transactions.

00:31:53.784 --> 00:31:55.860
I withdraw the cash
and give it to them separately.

00:31:56.099 --> 00:31:57.940
I just take a small service fee.

00:31:58.259 --> 00:32:00.339
Actually, you gave me this idea.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.140
Xuemei.

00:32:02.808 --> 00:32:03.499
Xuemei.

00:32:03.499 --> 00:32:04.099
Coming.

00:32:05.299 --> 00:32:05.980
I've checked it.

00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:07.059
I've counted it.

00:32:07.259 --> 00:32:07.940
Exactly right.

00:32:08.299 --> 00:32:09.499
Same as usual.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.019
Keep this, and thank you.

00:32:11.099 --> 00:32:11.819
You're welcome.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.499
No problem?

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.499
No problem at all.

00:32:13.539 --> 00:32:14.180
I have to go.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:14.739
Alright.

00:32:14.739 --> 00:32:15.819
See you, Ms. Li.

00:32:16.259 --> 00:32:17.019
Take care.

00:32:18.579 --> 00:32:21.019
I was worried
the sudden blackout would cause chaos.

00:32:21.259 --> 00:32:23.220
But you've calmed everyone down.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.700
Don't worry about us.

00:32:26.499 --> 00:32:27.019
Listen.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.180
Hear the sound of counting money.

00:32:33.779 --> 00:32:35.448
As long as we're still counting money,

00:32:36.024 --> 00:32:37.240
everyone can rest easy.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.819
Ms. Li, can you imagine?

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.380
Once the printing street is built,

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.432
the whole street will be filled

00:32:45.432 --> 00:32:47.064
with the sound of counting money.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.299
Ms. Li.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.019
We truly hope
the printing street can be built.

00:32:51.299 --> 00:32:52.140
Yes, Ms. Li.

00:32:52.499 --> 00:32:53.940
Can it really happen?

00:32:56.059 --> 00:32:56.700
Yes.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.019
It will happen. Rest assured.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:10.779
1,000 yuan per stack.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:11.620
50 stacks in total.

00:33:18.819 --> 00:33:19.739
It would take me

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.099
a month to earn this much.

00:33:25.779 --> 00:33:26.739
So much money!

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.700
It would take me 40 years to earn it!

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.819
I've already budgeted extra.

00:33:43.739 --> 00:33:45.059
You still owe money

00:33:46.019 --> 00:33:47.259
for raising turtles, right?

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:49.980
Yes.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:54.579
So,

00:33:56.259 --> 00:33:58.099
to repay my debt,

00:33:59.579 --> 00:34:02.779
I have to become a stupid bribe taker?

00:34:05.779 --> 00:34:07.660
Mr. Zheng.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:08.619
Mr. Zheng.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.260
Please take it and help me.

00:34:10.499 --> 00:34:12.300
You're bribing a public official.

00:34:12.619 --> 00:34:14.740
Shall I call the police
to arrest you right now?

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:17.980
Mr. Zheng, I was wrong!

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:18.872
I lost my mind.

00:34:18.872 --> 00:34:20.300
I care too much about Binhai Road.

00:34:20.579 --> 00:34:22.659
Arrest just me, Mr. Zheng!

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.619
Please help us.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.232
Where are you going?

00:34:30.456 --> 00:34:31.960
To the Power Supply Bureau. And you?

00:34:32.059 --> 00:34:32.940
Me too.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:34.940
You don't need to.

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.260
I can deal with

00:34:36.499 --> 00:34:37.820
Wang Defa alone.

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:46.219
Hello?

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:48.780
What?

00:34:53.208 --> 00:34:55.704
Why didn't you stop them
from going to the Power Supply Bureau?

00:34:56.184 --> 00:34:57.368
How long have they been gone?

00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.179
Okay. Got it.

00:35:01.139 --> 00:35:01.900
What's wrong now?

00:35:09.499 --> 00:35:12.019
Fatty, we're almost
at the Power Supply Bureau.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.420
Listen up, everyone!

00:35:16.139 --> 00:35:19.260
This time, we're fighting
for the 'monkeys' of Yuehai.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.420
We can only win.

00:35:20.539 --> 00:35:21.179
Got it?

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.059
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:35:22.219 --> 00:35:23.219
If we lose,

00:35:23.699 --> 00:35:26.579
all our factories
will be shut down. Got it?

00:35:28.579 --> 00:35:29.260
Watch out!

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.219
Do you even know how to drive?

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.980
Mr. Zheng!

00:35:51.579 --> 00:35:52.340
Turn around?

00:36:20.059 --> 00:36:21.300
Mr. Zheng!

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.260
I don't want
to make Binhai Road's things worse.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.820
So before we go in,
I'd like an agreement on three things.

00:36:29.659 --> 00:36:31.059
Tell me. What three things?

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.900
No swearing. No bad language.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:33.780
No fights.

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:39.619
Hello.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.380
We're from Yuehai
and are here to see Mr. Wang.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.139
May I ask where his office is?

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:45.980
From Yuehai?

00:36:46.659 --> 00:36:48.699
Well, he is in a meeting upstairs.

00:36:49.059 --> 00:36:50.820
It'll take a while. Just wait.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.699
Then, may I ask where we can wait?

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.139
Wherever you like.

00:36:55.219 --> 00:36:56.740
How can you talk like that?

00:36:57.699 --> 00:36:58.499
What's wrong?

00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.940
I always talk like this.

00:37:00.219 --> 00:37:01.619
Isn't Yuehai pretty capable?

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.059
Solve problems yourselves.

00:37:03.059 --> 00:37:04.139
Why come to us?

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:05.752
I...

00:37:07.179 --> 00:37:07.900
Are you okay?

00:37:08.619 --> 00:37:09.176
It's okay.

00:37:09.539 --> 00:37:10.420
Okay, sir.

00:37:10.499 --> 00:37:11.380
We'll wait here.

00:37:13.019 --> 00:37:13.619
You little...

00:37:17.579 --> 00:37:18.420
That's Zheng Decheng?

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:20.659
I get it now.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.699
He doesn't even look like a good person.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:23.460
You...

00:37:26.619 --> 00:37:28.460
I know. The three things.

00:37:30.659 --> 00:37:34.059
Seems Wang Defa doesn't want
to see us at all.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.499
So what do we do?

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:41.980
Go upstairs.

00:37:44.699 --> 00:37:46.420
Mr. Zheng, don't do anything rash!

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:47.539
Relax.

00:37:47.699 --> 00:37:48.699
Didn't he say?

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.940
We can wait wherever we please.

00:37:57.699 --> 00:37:58.699
Come on. Sit.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:37:59.900
It's fine.

00:38:07.192 --> 00:38:08.824
(Men's Restroom)

00:38:10.499 --> 00:38:12.900
Excuse me. Can I ask you something?

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.099
How many men's restrooms are
in this building?

00:38:16.699 --> 00:38:17.688
Only one men's restroom.

00:38:18.616 --> 00:38:19.768
This is the only one?

00:38:20.019 --> 00:38:21.139
Got it. Thanks.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.340
Mr. Zheng, why are we waiting here?

00:38:25.659 --> 00:38:26.659
It saves time.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.820
Trust me. We'll catch him
within half an hour.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.499
Are you sure?

00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:35.059
Yes. Who doesn't need the bathroom
during a meeting?

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:37.699
Besides,

00:38:38.659 --> 00:38:42.260
Mr. Wang has kidney problems.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.019
How do you know?

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.659
I know, of course.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.780
We used to work with me.

00:38:48.099 --> 00:38:48.980
He was my deputy.

00:38:51.928 --> 00:38:52.920
(Personnel Department)
I'm going to the restroom.

00:38:57.976 --> 00:38:58.619
Mr. Wang.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:38:59.740
Hello.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:02.940
Mr. Wang.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.980
See? I told you.

00:39:09.019 --> 00:39:09.699
Mr. Wang.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:10.900
Mr. Wang.

00:39:12.088 --> 00:39:13.016
Going to the restroom?

00:39:13.179 --> 00:39:13.980
Sure.

00:39:14.059 --> 00:39:14.740
Is it urgent?

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.780
Well, we're here

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.579
for the power supply to Yuehai.

00:39:19.139 --> 00:39:20.059
Just a short talk.

00:39:20.139 --> 00:39:21.300
We won't keep you long.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.059
Five minutes at most, okay?

00:39:23.139 --> 00:39:24.579
Let me use the restroom first.

00:39:26.139 --> 00:39:26.940
Mr. Wang.

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:27.980
Look,

00:39:28.619 --> 00:39:29.860
from last night until now,

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.619
Yuehai has been without power.

00:39:33.579 --> 00:39:35.900
But according to the power schedule,

00:39:36.219 --> 00:39:38.300
it's not Yuehai's turn
for nighttime outages yet.

00:39:38.619 --> 00:39:39.900
- Right.
- So what's going on?

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.940
Well, here is the thing.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.820
The whole county,

00:39:48.139 --> 00:39:50.300
not just the county, the whole city is

00:39:50.659 --> 00:39:52.619
in very short supply of electricity.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.300
So, a new power outage policy

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.219
has been introduced.

00:39:58.019 --> 00:39:58.780
Got it?

00:39:59.059 --> 00:40:00.900
I need to use the restroom right now.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:01.539
Come on.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.340
The new power outage policy, right?

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.659
How come we never heard of it?

00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:06.340
Exactly.

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.740
You didn't get the notice?

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:10.980
It's strange.

00:40:11.059 --> 00:40:12.539
Then, I have no idea.

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.900
Mr. Wang, when exactly
will the power come back?

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.579
When will it come back?

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.139
Let me check for you.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.219
Wait a moment.

00:40:21.059 --> 00:40:22.740
Huang!

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.460
Bring the schedule over here.

00:40:26.099 --> 00:40:26.740
Which schedule?

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.056
The power supply schedule.

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:29.019
Got it.

00:40:29.179 --> 00:40:29.820
Hurry up.

00:40:31.579 --> 00:40:32.420
Wait a second.

00:40:32.499 --> 00:40:33.579
You'll see the schedule.

00:40:33.699 --> 00:40:34.699
I'll use the restroom.

00:40:35.059 --> 00:40:36.780
Then, wait until the schedule arrives.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.139
Go after it arrives.

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.059
- The schedule!
- Quick!

00:40:44.179 --> 00:40:45.260
Okay, go back.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.260
Right here. Take a look.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.380
Look at this.

00:40:55.059 --> 00:40:55.940
Look.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.260
Yuehai will have power restored
in one hour.

00:40:59.499 --> 00:41:02.179
Municipal and residential areas
will get power first.

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.300
As for enterprises and factories,

00:41:04.499 --> 00:41:06.260
their power remains cut
for two more days.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:09.380
Wang Defa.

00:41:10.179 --> 00:41:11.699
Are you doing this on purpose?

00:41:11.699 --> 00:41:14.340
Why do you think so?
Didn't you see the schedule?

00:41:14.539 --> 00:41:15.460
Wang Defa!

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.740
Yuehai has so many factories,
big and small.

00:41:18.139 --> 00:41:20.539
Do you know how much money
one day of outage costs?

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.460
I'm not swearing.

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:29.099
I remember the three rules.

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:31.740
But you never said
I couldn't yell, right?

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.139
Can't I yell at you?

00:41:35.619 --> 00:41:37.179
Mr. Wang, this isn't right.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.460
Mr. Wang, look.

00:41:39.699 --> 00:41:40.740
Yuehai's enterprises

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.584
have longer outages than others.

00:41:42.776 --> 00:41:44.408
Why is that?

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.219
Jinxiang's enterprises
have an 8-hour outage.

00:41:48.579 --> 00:41:51.059
Pingchuan's enterprises
have an 11-hour outage.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:53.460
(Power Outage Schedule)
Only Yuehai Town's outage

00:41:53.659 --> 00:41:54.900
lasts 72 hours.

00:41:55.219 --> 00:41:56.499
Well, that makes sense.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.340
We base the outage duration

00:41:59.579 --> 00:42:02.579
on your electricity consumption,

00:42:02.579 --> 00:42:03.139
alright?

00:42:03.139 --> 00:42:05.940
Look, Yuehai has so many businesses.

00:42:06.059 --> 00:42:07.019
With huge power usage.

00:42:07.179 --> 00:42:10.099
Naturally, the outage lasts longer.

00:42:10.499 --> 00:42:11.860
I have to use the restroom.

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:13.460
No, wait.

00:42:17.099 --> 00:42:18.219
Fine.

00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:20.860
Yuehai is exceptional, okay?

00:42:21.219 --> 00:42:23.900
More businesses, higher electricity use.

00:42:24.179 --> 00:42:26.619
But you can't ignore others' survival.

00:42:27.059 --> 00:42:28.340
If you hog all the power,

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.099
what about others?

00:42:30.104 --> 00:42:30.872
You...

00:42:33.304 --> 00:42:34.008
(Men's Restroom)

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:36.019
Let me ask you.

00:42:37.059 --> 00:42:38.860
Is this about Binhai Road?
Are you purposely

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.300
tripping me up

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:41.860
and messing with me?

00:42:44.019 --> 00:42:45.499
What makes you think so?

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.740
I'm just a minor director.

00:42:49.139 --> 00:42:50.980
Do I have that much power?

00:42:51.179 --> 00:42:52.619
I'm not the one calling the shots.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.900
Then, who ordered you to do this?

00:42:55.219 --> 00:42:56.340
There you go again.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.820
Look, his wording is inappropriate.

00:42:59.019 --> 00:43:01.099
What do you mean by "order"?

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.168
