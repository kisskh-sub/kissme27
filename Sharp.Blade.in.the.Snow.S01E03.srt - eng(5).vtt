00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.320
Stone King of Hell, congratulations

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.320
for gaining the Demon Lord's trust.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.770
If it weren't for
Jiang Zimo's interference,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.400
I'd have already
killed that Demon Lord by now.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.120
Stone King of Hell, don't forget,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.920
your mission

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.480
is to gain her trust.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.000
Obtain what Princess Royal wants,

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.400
and only then will her life
be at your disposal.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.200
Trust?

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.600
You're connecting me with Princess Royal.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.600
Aren't you afraid

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.640
that Demon Lord
will take my life directly?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.479
Everyone knows

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.400
Stone King of Hell can take anyone's head

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.080
within a hundred paces.

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:44.880
I'm only afraid

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.240
that with just a little too much force,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.520
you might snap the Queen's neck.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.620
I'll give you ten days.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.080
If you obstruct me again,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.600
your own head won't be safe.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.320
I don't like others
meddling in my affairs.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.360
About Jiang Zimo,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.420
don't let it happen again.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.680
Stone King of Hell, please calm down.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.640
Jiang Zimo...

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.079

Your Majesty.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.200
Why aren't you wearing shoes again?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.120
I've been in the wasteland for so long,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.920
Got used to it.

Has Jiang Zimo been taken care of?

Jiang Zimo

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.079
has publicly taken
the Golden Silkworm Pill.

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.720
Now when Princess Royal and Rao Jun

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.160
see Jiang Zimo in prison,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.160
he'll be like a puddle of dead water.

that it would be our last meeting,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.040
would you have

On the late Queen's memorial day,

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.800
Princess Royal forbids you
from entering the temple to pay respects.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.130
It's truly outrageous.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.960
The officials petitioned

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.370
not to allow me to set foot
in the Imperial Ancestral Temple.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.240
She naturally went along with it.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.240
Princess Royal is deeply calculating.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.440
She could have quietly

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.280
ended your life in the wasteland.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.800
Yet now she welcomes you
to succeed the throne.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.130
It's truly suspicious.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.040
She hasn't obtained the formula

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.440
for Phoenix Incense yet.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.580
Of course she can't bear to let me die.

In the future,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.200
we must be more vigilant.

Greetings, Your Majesty,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.340
Mr. Bai.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.130
Your guess was indeed correct.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.320
Most of this batch of slaves

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.560
are assassins planted by those

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.560
with ill intent.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.320
Fortunately, we were prepared

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.200
and had Zimo infiltrate among them.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.520
They never expected

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.640
that Your Majesty had planted me

Not only did we
eliminate all the assassins,

if you want my life,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.040
why go to such lengths?

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.760
She must have ulterior motives.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.640
The real aim lies in the last man left,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.160
reel in this bait myself.

to take such risks for me.

to protect you.

The whole world believes

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.770
I'm a villain who killed my father
and caused my mother's death.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.480
a violent Demon Lord.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.760
The road ahead of me

Don't ever speak such distant words again.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.880

Mother,

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.720
I'll definitely uncover
the true culprit who killed Father

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.180
and protect Mocheng's century-old legacy.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.200
You will surely bless me, right?

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.440
Come,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.080
apply my makeup.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.280
Help me see

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.780
if it looks like

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:16.970
my sister's.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.680
In my heart,

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.770
you're the most beautiful.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.960
We are twin sisters,

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.440
so we should look exactly alike.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.240
Born of the same mother,

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.840
just because she was
the legitimate daughter,

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.200
she could inherit the royal surname,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.800
while I

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.800
could only follow Father's surname, Meng.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.680
However,

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.450
once I get the Phoenix Incense's formula,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.440
which controls people's minds,

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.040
and the Phoenix Seal from your

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.170
precious daughter,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.600
I'll send her to reunite with you
in the afterlife.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.680
But

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.480
then,

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.240
wouldn't I be too lonely?

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.040
I will always stay by your side.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.720
How could you be lonely?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.800
It's all that damned girl's fault.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.200
But she has been drinking

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.480
the medicine brewed from datura recently.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.560
Before long,

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.840
she will become dizzy, vomit blood,

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.100
and die from weakness.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.240
It seems

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.880
we need to act quickly.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.860
Your Highness,

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.760
I will serve you tonight.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.760
Come.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.440
The manager of the Slave House

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.800
asked me to deliver this to you.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.720
Do you know why this soil is red?

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.000
I don't know.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.800
This red soil

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.050
is nourished with human blood.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.380
It's the finest soil for flowers.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.540
Loving someone is like tending a flower.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.000
So,

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.840
do you love me?

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.160
Your Majesty.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:05.920

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.080
I'm here.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.160
Here.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.280
Come catch me.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.680
Your Majesty.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.520

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.900

Quickly, go see what to do.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.320
What happened to Her Majesty?

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.320
Go check quickly.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.880
What's wrong?

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.120
What...

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.880
What should we do?

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.000
Will Her Majesty be alright?

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.480
She should be fine.
