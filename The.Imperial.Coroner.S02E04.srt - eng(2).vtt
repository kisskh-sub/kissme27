00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:36.359
(had deceived many palace maids.)

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.370
(Liu'er is one of the people
who suffered the most.)

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.679
(Shi Qing had spoken up on her behalf.)

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.759
(But she and the other palace maids)

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.690
(did not have the courage
to step forward)

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.479

Sir, since there is injustice,

the Palace Domestic Service should
retry the case and clear the innocent.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.879
This…

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.100
Your Highness,
how should we deal with this?

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.500
Reopen the case.

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:43.120
Come.

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.759
If Wu Liang had been killed by my hand,

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:58.759
how good that would have been.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:07.520
No.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.599
Enough.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.199
Liu'er.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.319
Are you really going to let Wu Liang

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.199
drag Shi Qing down with him,

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.879
all because of your own cowardice?

You were waiting for a better outcome.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.690
You were waiting for them
to step forward on their own, weren't you?

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.080
Yes.

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:57.290
It is like someone sleepwalking.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.039
If they do not wake up by themselves,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.360
but are forced awake,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.680
then it is easy for danger to follow.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.240
If they do not summon the courage
to step forward themselves,

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.360
then even if Shi Qing
dies in their place,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.390
they will live trapped in nightmares
for the rest of their lives.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.720
This is the full account
of the palace maid Shi Qing's case.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.920
I never imagined that among women

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.199
there would be someone
of such righteousness.

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:32.040
I have issued an edict

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:33.639
declaring Shi Qing innocent.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:35.680
As for the others…

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.839
Your Majesty.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.000
I am in charge of the inner palace,
and such an incident has occurred.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.880
It is my failure
to discipline them properly.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.550
I ask that Your Majesty entrust
these people to me for punishment.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.040
I will strictly enforce palace rules.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.660
So be it,
as my beloved consort proposes.

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:00.630
Your Highness.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.360
Wu Jiang said a prisoner
insisted on seeing me by name?

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.660
- Shi Qing.
- Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.040
Why are you here?

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.480
In Wu Liang's case,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.800
Shi Qing requested
the strictest case closing procedure.

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:15.240
She took advantage of this chance
to leave the palace

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.160
especially to see you.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.980
Take your time and talk.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.120
It seems you really are all right now.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.000
Come.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.519
Sit.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.660
What about Liu'er and the others?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.990
Here is what happened.

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:30.879
Consort Hui told His Majesty
she would expel them from the palace,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.399
but in truth she had the palace official
suppress the matter,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.990
and forbade any discussion
within the palace.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.680
After the Chinese New Year,

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:39.079
she will let them leave
the palace together

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.290
with a group of older palace maids.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.279
Consort Hui is truly a kind person.

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:44.040
You are kind as well.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.730
Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.639
This is a gift that Liu'er and the others
asked me to give you.

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:53.120
It is not worth much,
just a small token of all our gratitude.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.519
It is so beautiful.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:00.800
I like it very much.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:01.830
Please thank them for me.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.839
It is we who should be thanking you.

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.000
If not for your help,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.240
I fear

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:08.800
I would not be alive now.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.090
And Liu'er and the others

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.190
would have lived in pain
for the rest of their lives.

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.680
The duty of the Three Judicial Offices
is to uncover the truth of every case.

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.199
It was your courage in standing together
that saved yourselves.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.800
The Emperor's birthday
has already passed.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.590
Nanzhao submitted a memorial and sent an envoy
to the capital to offer congratulations.

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:37.439
Gao Luoqian.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.860
Why has the delegation
still not arrived in the capital?

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.639
(Gao Luoqian, Vice Envoy of Nanzhao)
I beg Your Majesty to calm your anger.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.160
To show our sincerity,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.890
my king personally dispatched the Second Prince
to lead the mission and offer birthday wishes.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.560
For reasons unknown,
contact was suddenly lost along the way.

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:51.399
Great Tang spans vast lands.

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:53.639
Anything could happen along the way,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.639
could it not?

00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:59.920
Vice Envoy Gao is quite skilled
at accusing others first.

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:03.319
Over the past half year, more than
ten thousand of Great Tang's people

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.980
have gone missing
near the Nanzhao border.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.120
Nanzhao has yet to cooperate
with the investigation,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.000
yet Vice Envoy Gao turns the tables,

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:12.000
attempting to pin the Second Prince's
disappearance on Great Tang.

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:13.790
Forgive me for speaking plainly.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.920
Those people of Great Tang,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.439
were they truly abducted,
or did they defect?

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.160
Commandery Prince An,
have you investigated this thoroughly?

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.990
According to findings obtained
by the Three Judicial Offices,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.710
Nanzhao sent covert agents
who used gold mining

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.639
and high pay as bait,

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.879
luring Great Tang's people into Nanzhao.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.590
From that point on,
they vanished without a trace.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.100
Vice Envoy Gao has read the case files.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:36.439
At a moment like this,

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:37.920
why pretend ignorance?

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:39.399
Enough.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720
Both of you, say no more.

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:44.160
How could the Nanzhao delegation
disappear within Great Tang?

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:45.839
Huang Lv.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.399
Explain to me what truly happened.

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:50.500
Reporting to Your Majesty,

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:51.839
one month ago,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.040
the Nanzhao delegation
entered Great Tang through Jiaozhou.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.660
However, the delegation deliberately shook off
the Vice Minister of the Court of Diplomatic Affairs.

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:00.790
(Huang Lv)
It is unclear what Nanzhao intended

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:01.879
(Vice Minister of Rites)
by acting in this manner.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.360
By Lord Huang's account,

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:06.360
could it be that covert agents

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.500
deliberately obstructed
the Second Prince's entry into the capital,

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:10.690
in order to undermine relations
between our two states?

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.199
(Yu Luo,
maid to the Second Prince of Nanzhao)

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:26.759
Your Highness.

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:27.759
Have some water.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.919
They poisoned us
six times along the way.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.919
Now that we are
within Great Tang territory,

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.519
they finally seem more restrained.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.440
I doubt they will strike again.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.759
I only fear my dear elder brother
will act out of desperation.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.200
Chang'an…

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.440
How could he ever allow me to enter?

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.000
Whoa.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.039
Hyah!

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:04.960
Enemy attack!

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:07.360
Hyah!

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.720
Get the Second Prince out first!

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.000
Hyah!

00:09:18.039 --> 00:09:18.679
Hyah!

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:20.440
Hyah!

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:21.639
Hyah!

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.530
(You Chen'an, Second Prince of Nanzhao)
Split up.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.620
(Chief Envoy of Nanzhao)
Protect yourselves.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.520
We regroup at the mountain pass.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.799
Yes.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.559
Do not let him enter the forest!

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.519
Stop him!

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.940
Make sure he does not reach the woods!

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:18.799
Stay alert.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.680
Split up and search!

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:41.759
Vice Envoy Gao,

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:43.399
do not make reckless assumptions.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.600
Within Great Tang territory,

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:47.480
Commandery Prince An oversees

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:49.320
all prefectural and county offices.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.399
How could the Second Prince
possibly come to harm?

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.600
(Jiang Daohai, Prefect of the Capital)
Well… If the Second Prince

00:10:56.679 --> 00:10:58.879
were to suffer any mishap
within Great Tang,

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:00.919
I trust Commandery Prince An

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.039
would assume full responsibility,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.930
and carry out the imperial command
without fail.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.000
Then the safety of our Second Prince
will depend entirely on

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:13.799
Commandery Prince An.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.200
Xiao Jinyu.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.320
You will personally
investigate this matter.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.200
It concerns relations
between our two states,

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:22.540
so it must be handled with utmost care.

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:23.960
In urgent situations,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.519
you may act first and report later.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:29.960
Yes.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:39.639
Girl.

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:41.559
What you are eating

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:43.159
is far too plain.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.559
You should eat better.

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:45.480
I know.

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:46.200
He.

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:47.799
You rushed to see me so late.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.639
Did something happen?

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:52.120
Something did happen.

00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:53.320
What is it?

00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:55.759
It is about my business.

00:11:56.159 --> 00:11:58.559
I have a partner
who opened a pharmacy in the capital.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.110
He plans to return home and retire,
and sell it at a low price.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.159
So I thought...

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.480
You might want to take it over?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.879
I already have.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.120
That is wonderful.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.960
Then you will stay in the capital.

00:12:11.159 --> 00:12:12.399
Where is the pharmacy?

00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:13.240
Is it far?

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.720
Where will you live?

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.919
Does the pharmacy need help?

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.759
Slow down.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:18.000
One question at a time.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.659
He will stay at the manor.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.600
Really?

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.720
Does Your Highness think

00:12:23.799 --> 00:12:24.759
I am being a burden?

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:26.480
Chu Chu misses home.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.360
If you are willing to live here,
it will ease her homesickness.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.690
I should be thanking you.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.279
As for anything else,

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:34.840
tell me whenever you need help.

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:38.080
As for the rest,
there is no need to trouble you.

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:39.320
I can handle it myself.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.600
Thank you for your support.

00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:04.960
Much obliged for coming.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.440
The pharmacy is officially open.

00:13:07.679 --> 00:13:09.000
(Chang Shou, Duo Fu, pharmacy clerk)
Our shop owner is kindhearted

00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:11.559
and has prepared Prince An's recommended

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:13.080
secret herbal health tea.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.120
For the next three days,
it is free of charge.

00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:16.360
- Good.
- Excellent.

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:19.080
Everyone, please mind your safety.
Do not push.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.000
There is enough for everyone.

00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:20.679
Look how enthusiastic everyone is.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.000
I am the elder brother of Chu Chu,
the Commandery Prince An's brother-in-law.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:22.970
My word is my bond.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.440
Good!

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:25.220
By the way,

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:27.080
anyone who knows my sister Chu Chu,

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.570
when buying medicine,

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.240
will receive a discount
without exception.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.399
Good.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.860
And what about those
who know Commandery Prince An?

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:36.450
Anyone who knows Commandery Prince An,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.240
gets a bowl of cooling tea.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.679
Please, everyone.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.559
This way, please.

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:43.679
Inside, please, inside.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.679
Qianzhou salted vegetables.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.879
This flavor is one
of a kind in the capital.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.720
Whenever you crave it,

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.080
come by anytime.

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:01.200
Is it good?

00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:05.480
Girl, eat more.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.240
There is plenty.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.360
Sir, have you finished your meal?

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:20.480
Soft murmurs linger,
tender yet unspoken.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.590
Please come again
after you have finished, sir.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.720
Soft murmurs linger,
tender yet unspoken.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.780
When pepper blossoms fall,
the miasma begins to rise.

00:14:45.799 --> 00:14:46.990
My Lord, what are your instructions?

00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:54.450
Come with us
to the Three Judicial Offices.

00:14:56.559 --> 00:14:57.559
It's nothing.

00:14:58.519 --> 00:14:59.100
Your Highness.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.350
It was fortunate you had me
patrol the streets on the Emperor's birthday.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.519
Otherwise, we would not have
exposed this Nanzhao spy.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.360
Lord Jing.

00:15:05.799 --> 00:15:06.320
I truly

00:15:06.679 --> 00:15:08.000
do not understand what you mean.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.559
During the Emperor's birthday,

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.519
your people made far
too many small moves.

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:13.480
I was simply curious.

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:15.039
Gao Luoqian is still in Chang'an,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.320
yet the Nanzhao delegation
has not arrived.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.159
Who are you waiting for?

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.320
Wu Jiang.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.519
Come help His Highness.

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:27.320
What are you doing?

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:28.290
Your Highness.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.080
Your Highness.

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:30.600
Your Highness, I am just...

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.840
I am merely a common man.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.660
Reporting to Your Highness.
He has confessed.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.240
However, he is a newly
activated covert agent of Nanzhao.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.990
He only knows to take orders
from the Peacock.

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:41.919
Beyond that, he knows nothing for now.

00:15:43.919 --> 00:15:44.879
The Peacock?

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:47.679
What should we do next?

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.300
Keep him under close watch for now.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.720
Do not alert the enemy.

00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:52.960
Recently, within Chang'an,

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.360
have there been frequent
or unusual activities by foreigners?

00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:57.360
Aside from Gao Luoqian,

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.960
there are only Nanzhao merchants
doing business in the city.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.970
Keep a close watch on Gao Luoqian
and those Nanzhao merchants.

00:16:03.039 --> 00:16:03.519
Yes.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.279
(Chen Feng,
guard to Commandery Prince An)

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:07.380
Your Highness.
We have located the Nanzhao delegation.

00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:08.940
Our men were patrolling
the outskirts of the capital

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.159
and happened upon their convoy.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.470
They claimed they had lost their way,
which delayed them for several days.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.380
By noon tomorrow, they will reach
the outskirts of the capital.

00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:17.990
Inform the Ministry of Rites.
Prepare to receive the Nanzhao envoys.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.990
The Court of Diplomatic Affairs
may prepare a banquet.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.759
From today onward, all offices
of the Three Judicial Offices

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.310
are to cooperate
with the Prefect of the Capital,

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.320
to ensure absolute security
within the capital.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.120
Yes.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.320
At last, they have arrived.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:33.360
My Lord.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.330
A confidential letter from court.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.860
(Hong Luan, maid to Gao Luoqian)

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.519
(Covert assets activated.)

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.660
(The Peacock
assumes control of the spy network.)

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:47.320
(Full cooperation is imperative.)

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.330
The King has ordered me
to give full cooperation,

00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:53.919
yet this Peacock
still refuses to show himself.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.799
How am I supposed
to cooperate fully like this?

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.240
Who would have thought

00:17:12.279 --> 00:17:14.839
that the ever-stoic Commandery Prince An

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.839
would have such a weakness.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:18.920
His feet are ticklish.

00:17:22.279 --> 00:17:23.039
Your Highness.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.260
Isn't the Commandery Princess
Consort An also ticklish?

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:32.720
Chu Chu.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:34.799
I am sorry.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.400
Since our marriage,

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.850
I have dragged you into
the Three Judicial Offices every day,

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.890
and scarcely spent proper time with you.

00:17:43.319 --> 00:17:45.160
Why are you apologizing
all the time lately?

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.890
Aren't you keeping me company
right now, soaking our feet together?

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.319
Investigating cases
and examining bodies,

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.990
this kind of life
is actually quite interesting.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.119
Besides,

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.079
the palace treats me
much differently now.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.070
Liu'er even said

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.590
that after leaving the palace, she wants
to learn to be a coroner from me.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.360
It was you who changed
how they see things.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.400
In a few days, the Three Judicial Offices
will recruit new coroners.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:04.590
You will be even busier then.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.200
That's true.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.759
Time really does fly.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.300
Back when the coroner selection
was held three years ago,

00:18:15.319 --> 00:18:17.160
it was Your Highness
who set my examination.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.839
You were exceptionally bold that day.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.799
You tried to strip me
the moment you stepped up.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.319
Your Highness.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.720
This year's new coroners

00:18:30.759 --> 00:18:32.039
must be outstanding as well.

00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:34.160
I want to exchange ideas
with them properly.

00:18:34.559 --> 00:18:35.000
All right.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.990
Let's set official matters
aside for now.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.940
Tomorrow's reception of the delegation

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.650
does not require you
or Leng Yue to worry.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.490
The two of you can go along
and relax for a couple of days.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.440
But...

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.960
Who exactly is coming
with the Nanzhao delegation this time?

00:18:48.319 --> 00:18:49.400
Nanzhao's Second Prince.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.810
The adopted son of the King of Nanzhao.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.279
Vice Envoy Gao.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.240
Is this truly how

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:55.319
the Nanzhao delegation
enters Great Tang?

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.780
Prefect Jiang,
please do not take offense.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.079
Something must have gone wrong
on the road.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.599
Why were you delayed for so long?

00:20:22.119 --> 00:20:23.460
Is this all there is of your party?

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:31.400
Yu Luo?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.100
Where is the Second Prince?

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.260
We apologize
for keeping all the lords waiting.

00:20:54.279 --> 00:20:55.599
You Chen'an, Chief Envoy of Nanzhao.

00:20:55.759 --> 00:20:58.200
By royal command,
he bear the state letter to Great Tang.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.450
Since you bear the state letter,

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.400
where is the principal envoy?

00:21:06.039 --> 00:21:08.039
Though Nanzhao lies in distant lands,

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.599
surely it cannot be ignorant
of such basic protocol.

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:13.480
Yu Luo.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.599
Where is the Second Prince?

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.799
It is one thing for him to act
as he pleases in Nanzhao,

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:20.119
but surely he would not

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.990
show such discourtesy
before Great Tang as well.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.160
We ask the lords
for their understanding.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.359
The journey was long and exhausting,

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.279
and the Chief Envoy is unwell.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.690
He feared his appearance
might be improper and offend protocol,

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.190
so he asked me to speak on his behalf.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.519
According to Great Tang etiquette,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.990
the principal envoy
must alight from the carriage.

00:21:47.359 --> 00:21:49.400
Why has it taken so long to even enter?

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:50.759
They are locked in a standoff.

00:21:51.319 --> 00:21:52.400
Diplomacy between states

00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:54.079
is always a matter

00:21:54.119 --> 00:21:55.200
of who gains the upper hand.

00:21:55.839 --> 00:21:57.720
At some point, they start competing,

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.360
and then it turns into open quarreling.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.759
You make it sound
like a brawl at the village gate.

00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:05.319
That is exactly it.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.359
Let me tell you,

00:22:07.599 --> 00:22:08.440
this kind of wrangling

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.039
is best left to the Prince.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.360
You need not trouble yourself.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.000
Here.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:14.920
Have a grape.

00:22:16.839 --> 00:22:17.720
Enough, Yu Luo.

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:19.440
All this evasion and concealment

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.079
could it be that something has happened
to the Second Prince?

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.519
Lord Gao.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.519
We meet again.

00:22:52.279 --> 00:22:53.759
You are unharmed?

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:57.000
Did Lord Gao wish that I were not?

00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:01.799
It was nothing more
than a minor chill on the road.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.359
I only feared passing it
on to the lords.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.990
Thank you all
for coming so far to receive me.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.839
I was rushing along the journey,

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.880
and thus caught a bout of chills.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.950
That is why I was forced
to delay for some days.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.370
My father has written
in earnest sincerity,

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.990
hoping that Nanzhao and Great Tang
may remain in lasting amity.

00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:44.780
He wishes His Majesty of Great Tang
long life and peace without worry.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.060
The envoy has traveled a long distance.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.280
If you are feeling unwell,

00:23:56.799 --> 00:23:58.119
then I shall accompany the envoy

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.000
to rest first at the outer palace.

00:24:00.759 --> 00:24:01.279
I presume

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.640
this must be Commandery Prince An.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.270
I have long heard of you.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.680
The palace banquet
will be held in three days.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.440
The following seven days

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:26.390
are set aside for exchange between
the envoys of all regions and Great Tang.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.290
The Chief Envoy's return to the capital
is scheduled for the seventh day of next month.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.240
Chief Envoy.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.200
Chief Envoy.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.400
My Lord.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.319
If there is anything,

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.920
please inform my maid instead.

00:24:37.839 --> 00:24:40.160
I am weary and wish to rest first.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.839
The Chief Envoy has traveled far.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:43.519
You should indeed have a good rest.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.890
Many thanks, Commandery Prince An.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.319
Greetings to Commandery Princess
Consort An.

00:24:52.119 --> 00:24:54.990
- Greetings to Commandery Princess Consort An.
- Greetings to Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:57.190
Greetings, Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.920
Your rooms have already been prepared.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.880
Some refreshments
have also been arranged.

00:25:02.319 --> 00:25:05.000
May the Chief Envoy uphold
Nanzhao's long-held wish on this journey,

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:06.380
to restore harmony with Great Tang

00:25:06.599 --> 00:25:07.990
and secure peace along the borders.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.090
Thank you, Princess Consort.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.759
Thank you, Commandery Prince An.

00:25:25.519 --> 00:25:26.160
Your Highness.

00:25:26.359 --> 00:25:27.160
Careful.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.359
Please.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:39.690
Your Highness.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.690
There is something wrong
with You Chen'an.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.610
At first glance,
his movements seemed normal,

00:25:44.759 --> 00:25:46.000
(Steps were unsteady)
but in truth his footing was weak.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.359
(Leaning on his maid)
He was relying on that maid to support his weight.

00:25:49.079 --> 00:25:50.799
His voice lacked strength when he spoke.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.960
As for his complexion,

00:25:52.319 --> 00:25:54.240
(Rouge and powder)
it was clearly concealed with makeup.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:55.359
Something is clearly off.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:58.780
Your Highness.

00:25:59.039 --> 00:25:59.580
Your Highness.

00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:00.790
Are you all right?

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:04.790
I felt something was wrong
when I saw him at the gate as well.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:06.880
Let's go take a look.

00:26:15.319 --> 00:26:15.799
Who is it?

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.319
Chief Envoy.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.890
I am the Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.990
May I ask what brings
the Princess Consort here?

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.559
I believe you may need assistance.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:27.640
Do not worry.

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:29.400
Only the Prince and I are here.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.990
Great Tang will not allow the Chief Envoy
of Nanzhao to come to harm.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.279
Open the door.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.640
I sensed something was wrong earlier.

00:26:50.119 --> 00:26:52.450
Your complexion is poor
and you need treatment immediately.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.160
I am a coroner.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.520
I can examine your injuries first.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.279
A coroner?

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:57.839
Princess Consort, are you treating
our prince like a corpse?

00:26:58.799 --> 00:26:59.559
Yu Luo.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:00.960
Besides,

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.000
His Highness's body

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.000
cannot possibly be examined
by a strange woman.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.680
Then I will give instructions,
and you may carry them out.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:08.470
Is that acceptable?

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:14.359
Please first cleanse your hands
with hot water and strong liquor.

00:27:27.119 --> 00:27:28.880
The wound was treated with great care,

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.640
but there is still residual poison.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.440
The wound must be cleaned at once.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.400
Please sprinkle this lime
over the wound first.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.150
Fortunately, it has not suppurated yet.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.290
Had it been delayed any longer,
it would have been fatal.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.039
Why did you not seek treatment earlier?

00:27:44.799 --> 00:27:45.880
On the road here,

00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:48.960
I happened to be saved
by an old acquaintance.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.640
He treated my wound.

00:27:51.559 --> 00:27:52.519
As it happens,

00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:54.640
he too was a coroner.

00:27:56.839 --> 00:27:57.799
If not for him,

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.700
I would not have had the strength
to reach Great Tang.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.340
Being able to see the Prince
and Princess Consort

00:28:04.359 --> 00:28:06.180
was already the limit
of what I could manage.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:07.990
Then why did you pretend
to be well just now?

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.799
What were you worried about?

00:28:10.799 --> 00:28:11.660
Commandery Prince An.

00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:14.759
The real danger

00:28:15.839 --> 00:28:18.000
has never lain
in a relationship like ours,

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:20.240
one that only appears to be opposed.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.759
It lies in the shadows,

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.079
in places unseen.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.100
Now that I have come to Great Tang,

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.559
I entrust my very life

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.039
to the Princess Consort.

00:28:37.559 --> 00:28:38.480
Your Highness.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.240
Your Highness.

00:28:40.359 --> 00:28:41.000
Your Highness.

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:42.839
(Hanguang Gate)

00:28:42.839 --> 00:28:43.480
Next one.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.039
What is this?

00:28:45.519 --> 00:28:46.160
Open it and see.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:48.680
All right.

00:28:48.839 --> 00:28:49.359
Next.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.519
Hurry up.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.890
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.720
No suspicious activity
was found in the shops or inns.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.190
There were no suspicious persons
on the streets either.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.240
Move.

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:15.920
Go on.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:16.799
Thank you, officer.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.200
Where are you going?

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.750
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:27.599
Talk.

00:29:28.279 --> 00:29:29.640
Who ordered you?

00:29:29.759 --> 00:29:31.720
Why assassinate the principal envoy?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.300
If you want to kill me, then do it.

00:29:34.319 --> 00:29:35.480
Stop wasting your breath.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.079
Trying to play
fearless martyr in front of me?

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.079
Chen Ming, originally named An Da,
a native of Nanzhao.

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.020
Half a year ago, you secretly
settled your wife and child

00:29:44.039 --> 00:29:45.690
in a private residence
outside the capital.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.200
You chose your hiding place well.

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:49.960
The outskirts of the capital
are indeed hard to search.

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:52.279
But you ran into me.

00:29:52.839 --> 00:29:54.039
I will give you two choices.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.799
First, you keep your mouth shut.

00:29:57.519 --> 00:29:59.640
I send your wife and child
to join you on the road.

00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:01.359
Second,

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.920
you tell the truth.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.300
I will report to the Prince

00:30:06.319 --> 00:30:08.500
and secure Great Tang citizenship
for your entire family,

00:30:08.519 --> 00:30:10.039
so you may settle here for good.

00:30:14.319 --> 00:30:15.000
Which will it be?

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.600
Your Highness.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.850
The remaining poison
has been forced out,

00:30:21.079 --> 00:30:22.799
but he has not regained consciousness yet.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.640
His injuries are severe.

00:30:25.319 --> 00:30:27.200
He will need a long period of rest.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:28.690
Thank you for your trouble, Physician.

00:30:29.079 --> 00:30:31.300
What happened today
must remain strictly confidential.

00:30:31.599 --> 00:30:32.000
Yes.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:32.839
Your Highness.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.990
Our deepest thanks to the Prince
and Princess Consort for saving his life.

00:30:39.759 --> 00:30:40.799
You may speak now.

00:30:41.119 --> 00:30:43.410
What dangers did you encounter
on the way to the capital?

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.279
Along the journey,

00:30:46.839 --> 00:30:48.119
we were attacked again and again.

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:50.130
The Second Prince
narrowly escaped death.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.559
Fortunately, he grew up in forest lands,

00:30:54.039 --> 00:30:55.260
and used the cover of the woods

00:30:55.279 --> 00:30:56.160
to evade pursuit.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.190
By further fortune, an old acquaintance
came to his aid.

00:30:59.359 --> 00:31:00.079
After that,

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.980
we disguised ourselves and split
from the guards to travel separately.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.680
Even so,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.720
danger followed us at every step.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.160
Thus, we finally reached Chang'an
after countless hardships.

00:31:12.279 --> 00:31:13.880
Do you know who was behind it?

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.839
I fear my dear brother
was driven to desperation.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.160
Chang'an.

00:31:19.839 --> 00:31:21.319
How could he ever allow me to enter?

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.480
- Please.
- Please.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.319
- Please.
- Please.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.540
Fill the cup.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.100
Please.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:44.799
Your Highness.

00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:47.519
Something about Nanzhao
feels strange to me.

00:31:48.119 --> 00:31:50.039
Lord Gao seems indifferent

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.500
to whether the Second Prince
lives or dies.

00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:52.720
And that Second Prince himself

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.279
is more guarded against
his own people than against us.

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.079
When will we see
the truth of court politics?

00:31:58.559 --> 00:32:00.920
Leng Yue says this is what comes
from constant exposure,

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:02.190
that the pupil surpasses the master.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.480
The Nanzhao royal court

00:32:05.559 --> 00:32:06.400
is far from peaceful.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.359
This Gao Luoqian

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.119
is the elder brother
of the Crown Princess of Nanzhao.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.599
The siblings are extremely close.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.090
He is a staunch supporter
of the Eldest Prince.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.480
However, there are some matters

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.279
that only require us
to observe and wait.

00:32:19.599 --> 00:32:21.210
First, this is Nanzhao's
internal affair.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.079
Second, power struggles

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.900
will inevitably
bring disaster upon Nanzhao.

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:26.160
For Great Tang,

00:32:26.519 --> 00:32:27.680
it brings benefit and no harm.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.440
As for me, I will simply focus on
curing the Second Prince,

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.710
and make sure his life does not
bring trouble to Great Tang.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.759
You're wise.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.160
Good.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.000
You are quite bold.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.119
Daring to assassinate the Chief Envoy
of Nanzhao right under my watch.

00:34:14.039 --> 00:34:14.840
He swallowed poison.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:15.920
He is dead.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.039
Your Highness.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:22.410
The man held
in the Three Judicial Offices has awakened.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.820
(See the Wind and Listen to the Rain)

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.239
Second Prince.

00:34:59.159 --> 00:35:00.310
Where is Commandery Prince An?

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:00.719
Your Highness...

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:01.960
The Prince has not yet returned.

00:35:02.719 --> 00:35:03.880
To ensure your safety,

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.100
you have been secretly placed
within the Three Judicial Offices.

00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:06.920
I am Jing Yi.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.159
Vice Minister Jing.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.079
The Second Prince knows me?

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.750
Before departing on the mission,
I familiarized myself a little

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.490
with the names of officials
ranked fourth grade and above.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.440
How is your recovery?

00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:20.199
Much better.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:22.440
Let me show you around.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.580
(See the Wind and Listen to the Rain)

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.400
(Discern the Bigger Picture
from Small Hints)

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.719
This is the coroner's room.

00:35:37.079 --> 00:35:39.320
This is where the Commandery
Princess Consort An works.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.910
Truly, seeing it in person
surpasses all I have heard.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.480
Your Highness.

00:35:51.039 --> 00:35:51.920
Second Prince.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.880
You have been very attentive
toward Great Tang.

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.280
I have lived
between cracks since childhood,

00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:58.920
long under the eaves of the royal court.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.660
Lowering my head
and bending myself became habit.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.559
Second Prince, you overstate it.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.350
As the Chief Envoy visiting our court,

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.410
Great Tang must of course
treat you with propriety.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:09.920
Thank you, Commandery Prince An.

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:12.890
As for the life-saving kindness shown
by the Princess Consort yesterday.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.540
The residual poison in your body
has not been fully cleared.

00:36:15.559 --> 00:36:16.960
Your wounds have yet to heal.

00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:18.960
You should rest more and worry less.

00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:22.519
Those who pursued you relentlessly,

00:36:23.039 --> 00:36:24.840
bent on taking your life,

00:36:25.559 --> 00:36:27.079
do you know who stands behind them?

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.119
If they were bandits of Great Tang,

00:36:30.519 --> 00:36:31.639
I would spare no effort

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.559
to hunt down the truth.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.290
I will give you an explanation,

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.280
so that no rift arises
between Great Tang and Nanzhao.

00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:41.390
Those in Nanzhao who wish me dead

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.880
are hardly just one or two.

00:36:58.679 --> 00:37:00.000
My apologies, Chen'an.

00:37:00.679 --> 00:37:01.868
(You Longsheng, Eldest Prince of Nanzhao)
Thinking back,

00:37:01.868 --> 00:37:02.920
(You Longsheng, Eldest Prince of Nanzhao)
you were raised in the hunting grounds as a child.

00:37:03.559 --> 00:37:05.320
(You Longsheng, Eldest Prince of Nanzhao)
I carelessly confused you

00:37:06.159 --> 00:37:07.039
with those beasts.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:09.079
You labors day and night
to ease Father's worries.

00:37:09.679 --> 00:37:10.730
If your eyes blur at times,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.880
that is only natural.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.119
Still, it cannot compare to
how deeply Father values you.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.119
Such an honor as representing Nanzhao
at the Emperor's Birthday Festival

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.639
could even fall to you.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.440
You misunderstand.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.039
This mission to Great Tang

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.280
was long and arduous.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:28.840
There were dangers along the road.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.159
Father values you deeply,

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.360
so he would never send you
far from the capital.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.320
Come.

00:37:34.679 --> 00:37:36.639
Take a look at what I have hunted.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.000
Who knows,

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.519
it may even be
an old acquaintance of Chen'an.

00:37:43.599 --> 00:37:44.719
When I was ten,

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.590
my father took me in as his adopted son
and brought me into the palace.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.639
From that day on,
I became a thorn in everyone's side.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.239
That is only natural.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.840
The court once balanced among factions

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.960
suddenly gained an unknown variable.

00:37:58.079 --> 00:37:59.730
Of course they would
want me gone at once.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.280
By your account,

00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:05.880
the King of Nanzhao
was testing the waters.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.000
Perhaps I was merely the stone.

00:38:09.719 --> 00:38:10.559
Who can say.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.039
In recent years,
Nanzhao itself has grown more stable,

00:38:15.039 --> 00:38:16.199
yet within the court,

00:38:17.239 --> 00:38:18.280
chaos only deepens.

00:38:19.119 --> 00:38:20.599
Entangled interests,

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.079
countless eyes fixed on the throne.

00:38:24.159 --> 00:38:27.000
My uncles and elder kinsmen,
every one of them wants a hand in it.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.599
Fortunately, I have come to Chang'an.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.159
They dare not act rashly for now.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.180
We should thank the Second Prince

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.320
for speaking so frankly.

00:38:38.199 --> 00:38:40.159
You have shared much
of Nanzhao's situation.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.800
Even if you had not,

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.920
the Three Judicial Offices
would have uncovered it in time.

00:38:47.199 --> 00:38:48.000
My candor

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.079
is meant as thanks
for your saving my life.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.450
I still must prepare
for the palace banquet.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:53.280
I will take my leave.

00:38:54.039 --> 00:38:54.519
Jing Yi.

00:38:55.199 --> 00:38:55.800
See him out.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.519
This way, Second Prince.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:05.990
Many thanks to you both.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.060
