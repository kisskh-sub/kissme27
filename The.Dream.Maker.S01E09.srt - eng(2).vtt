00:01:38.668 --> 00:01:39.308
Who did this?

00:01:39.648 --> 00:01:40.588
- They.
- Who did this?

00:01:40.588 --> 00:01:41.288
What happened?

00:01:45.948 --> 00:01:47.467
M-Ms. Li, you're here.

00:01:47.668 --> 00:01:48.708
Why is it so messy here?

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:49.428
Mr. Xie,

00:01:49.907 --> 00:01:52.508
Ms. Gao's factory has over 20 employees.

00:01:53.228 --> 00:01:54.547
Severely overstaffed.

00:01:54.907 --> 00:01:56.148
This situation carries risks.

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:58.107
I had no choice.

00:01:58.428 --> 00:01:59.827
Look. So many precedents.

00:02:00.308 --> 00:02:02.347
Gao Xuemei, you're wrong.

00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:03.387
How am I wrong?

00:02:03.387 --> 00:02:04.467
You tell me what you did.

00:02:04.588 --> 00:02:06.028
You are wrong. Accept it.

00:02:06.148 --> 00:02:06.987
A huge mistake!

00:02:07.028 --> 00:02:08.067
How is it a huge mistake?

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:10.028
Y-Your mistake's impact

00:02:10.028 --> 00:02:11.000
- is significant.
- How is it significant?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.028
How is it significant?

00:02:12.028 --> 00:02:14.108
Ms. Li shows you great care
and deep consideration.

00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:15.947
What's Ms. Li saying?

00:02:16.388 --> 00:02:17.428
Don't mind what she says,

00:02:17.648 --> 00:02:18.148
right?

00:02:18.148 --> 00:02:20.067
She does it for you. Deep consideration.

00:02:20.268 --> 00:02:21.907
You're stubborn, acting like a show-off.

00:02:21.988 --> 00:02:22.507
Zip it.

00:02:22.828 --> 00:02:24.548
Just shut it down. Ms. Li said so.

00:02:24.588 --> 00:02:25.588
Why should I?

00:02:26.227 --> 00:02:27.507
We workers have strength!

00:02:27.507 --> 00:02:28.440
Do you have strength?

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.028
I'm not forceful enough?

00:02:30.828 --> 00:02:31.328
You...

00:02:32.907 --> 00:02:35.067
Don't you understand
why you're being told to stop?

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:35.888
You...

00:02:36.868 --> 00:02:38.667
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:45.187
You crow like a rooster now?

00:02:45.787 --> 00:02:47.268
Ms. Li, let's talk.

00:02:49.347 --> 00:02:51.512
Closing a factory doesn't require
this many people.

00:02:51.512 --> 00:02:52.907
- Exactly.
- Has it exceeded or not?

00:02:52.907 --> 00:02:53.880
- It exceeded.
- It's over the limit, right?

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.108
No, just to maintain order.

00:02:55.187 --> 00:02:55.907
See? It exceeds.

00:02:55.947 --> 00:02:56.728
You misunderstood.

00:02:56.728 --> 00:02:57.868
They weren't brought by us.

00:02:57.947 --> 00:02:58.588
Right, not us.

00:02:58.627 --> 00:02:59.864
Then who brought them? Me?

00:02:59.864 --> 00:03:00.667
Xie brought them?

00:03:02.108 --> 00:03:02.608
Honestly!

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:03.548
All heartless, huh?

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:05.028
You're wearing clothes we made!

00:03:05.428 --> 00:03:06.588
Right? Clothes we made.

00:03:06.627 --> 00:03:07.947
About face! Forward march!

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:08.627
Come on. Move.

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:09.627
Move!

00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:11.448
- Mr. Xie.
- Misunderstanding.

00:03:11.448 --> 00:03:13.507
For now, this factory
must suspend operations.

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:14.268
Knock off work.

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:15.167
Knock off.

00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:16.868
Set off firecrackers. Knock off.

00:03:17.187 --> 00:03:19.347
Xie, are we really stopping?

00:03:19.828 --> 00:03:20.388
You...

00:03:20.507 --> 00:03:22.428
D-Don't discuss this with me.

00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:24.747
The Town Mayor asked us to stop.

00:03:25.308 --> 00:03:26.187
So we stop.

00:03:26.947 --> 00:03:28.388
Seven people. Knock off.

00:03:28.868 --> 00:03:29.428
Okay.

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:35.227
Seven people.

00:03:35.787 --> 00:03:37.627
Hear that?
The Town Mayor said seven people.

00:03:37.627 --> 00:03:38.227
Seven people.

00:03:38.227 --> 00:03:40.467
Ms. Li says seven people,
so let it be seven people.

00:03:40.747 --> 00:03:42.467
The original six, plus me, seven people.

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:43.667
The rest can just leave.

00:03:43.787 --> 00:03:44.287
I...

00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:46.507
Ms. Gao, you can't be serious, right?

00:03:46.868 --> 00:03:48.507
My whole family depends on my wages.

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:50.067
Yeah! How are we supposed to live?

00:03:50.187 --> 00:03:50.787
Ms. Gao.

00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:52.227
We have a family to support!

00:03:52.308 --> 00:03:54.988
Stop talking. Enough.

00:03:55.828 --> 00:03:57.988
I understand, all of it.
But it's no use.

00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:00.787
We have to do what Ms. Li said.

00:04:01.187 --> 00:04:02.268
Listen to the Town Mayor.

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:04.347
Explain it clearly. Stop crying.

00:04:04.388 --> 00:04:05.347
- Ms. Li!
- Ms. Li!

00:04:06.828 --> 00:04:08.108
Calm down!

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:10.787
Calm down!

00:04:11.588 --> 00:04:13.347
Go back!

00:04:13.347 --> 00:04:14.828
(Let's All Look After Public Property)

00:04:14.828 --> 00:04:15.787
We'll see how it goes.

00:04:16.987 --> 00:04:17.907
They are going too far.

00:04:18.307 --> 00:04:19.188
How can they do this?

00:04:19.347 --> 00:04:20.068
Let's go.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.464
Turn right. It's right there.

00:04:22.907 --> 00:04:23.427
Fatty.

00:04:24.188 --> 00:04:24.748
Fatty, come.

00:04:24.828 --> 00:04:25.467
Perfect timing.

00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:26.360
- Fatty.
- Come here.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.736
- Let me introduce you.
- Stay calm.

00:04:28.188 --> 00:04:29.867
Some top businessmen from the Northeast.

00:04:30.508 --> 00:04:31.388
Five Hus.

00:04:32.867 --> 00:04:33.388
Hello, sir.

00:04:33.628 --> 00:04:34.128
Come on.

00:04:34.508 --> 00:04:35.008
Come on.

00:04:36.148 --> 00:04:37.107
Come over here.

00:04:50.188 --> 00:04:51.307
Keep them company for a bit.

00:04:51.512 --> 00:04:52.748
- Got it.
- I need to step out.

00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:56.588
It's about what we're
treating you to for lunch.

00:04:57.227 --> 00:04:57.907
What happened?

00:04:58.188 --> 00:05:00.148
Ms. Li is trying
to shut down Xuemei's factory.

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:01.467
We're going to help.

00:05:03.288 --> 00:05:04.408
Shut down the factory?

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.828
Li Qiuping?

00:05:06.547 --> 00:05:08.547
Mr. Zheng, you must
know about this, right?

00:05:09.307 --> 00:05:10.828
I'll show clients around the factory.

00:05:10.867 --> 00:05:11.547
How would I know?

00:05:11.867 --> 00:05:13.508
No, you absolutely can't go there!

00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:15.948
Listen. They're almost coming
to blows over there.

00:05:19.508 --> 00:05:21.028
If they see that mess,

00:05:21.347 --> 00:05:22.667
who'd dare do business with us?

00:05:23.508 --> 00:05:24.427
What's going on?

00:05:25.467 --> 00:05:27.547
I heard they exceeded hiring limits.

00:05:35.467 --> 00:05:37.188
Got a job for you.

00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:37.967
Go ahead.

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:39.867
Do whatever you can

00:05:40.347 --> 00:05:41.787
to keep these clients here.

00:05:42.148 --> 00:05:42.667
Got it.

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:43.588
Mission accomplished.

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:44.467
Yes.

00:05:45.388 --> 00:05:45.888
Gentlemen,

00:05:45.907 --> 00:05:47.068
anything you want to eat?

00:05:48.068 --> 00:05:49.107
W-What's going on?

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.828
Let me introduce you.

00:05:51.307 --> 00:05:53.388
These are Yuehai's finest entrepreneurs.

00:05:53.427 --> 00:05:54.028
Yes.

00:05:54.028 --> 00:05:54.588
I'm flattered.

00:05:54.628 --> 00:05:56.188
Hearing you came all this way,

00:05:56.427 --> 00:05:57.787
they insisted on treating you

00:05:57.948 --> 00:05:59.628
to Yuehai's most authentic cuisine.

00:05:59.787 --> 00:06:00.307
Yes.

00:06:00.307 --> 00:06:01.588
And our finest Yuehai liquor.

00:06:02.547 --> 00:06:04.787
Something urgent just came up.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:06.268
I need to handle it now.

00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:08.227
So, I'll pick you up later.

00:06:08.547 --> 00:06:09.148
Enjoy the meal!

00:06:09.467 --> 00:06:10.188
Mr. Zheng.

00:06:10.628 --> 00:06:11.508
Look after them.

00:06:11.787 --> 00:06:13.107
My apologies. Sorry.

00:06:13.188 --> 00:06:14.028
Hu.

00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:15.028
All Hu here, right?

00:06:15.867 --> 00:06:17.467
Stay calm.

00:06:17.508 --> 00:06:19.388
Don't get worked up.

00:06:19.748 --> 00:06:20.948
Calm down first, okay?

00:06:21.487 --> 00:06:21.987
Mr. Zheng.

00:06:21.987 --> 00:06:22.787
What are you doing?

00:06:22.787 --> 00:06:23.307
You're here!

00:06:23.347 --> 00:06:24.148
I know. Talk later.

00:06:24.188 --> 00:06:24.907
Give us justice.

00:06:25.028 --> 00:06:25.547
Just go.

00:06:25.588 --> 00:06:26.227
Mr. Zheng.

00:06:26.227 --> 00:06:27.948
- Give us justice!
- Come on. Disperse.

00:06:28.347 --> 00:06:29.208
Standing right here.

00:06:29.208 --> 00:06:30.828
What will people think if they see this?

00:06:30.987 --> 00:06:32.547
Mr. Zheng, glad you're back.

00:06:32.867 --> 00:06:34.347
Let me brief you on the situation.

00:06:34.508 --> 00:06:36.427
Their factory can't operate any longer.

00:06:36.588 --> 00:06:37.588
Alright, Ms. Li.

00:06:37.948 --> 00:06:38.904
We'll talk in a moment.

00:06:38.904 --> 00:06:39.500
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:06:39.528 --> 00:06:40.028
Listen.

00:06:40.028 --> 00:06:41.268
No, what are you saying?

00:06:41.496 --> 00:06:42.392
Are you dense or what?

00:06:42.584 --> 00:06:43.768
Get everyone to disperse now!

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.580
W-Wouldn't that be a joke?

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.347
What are you doing?

00:06:46.347 --> 00:06:47.268
Disperse first!

00:06:47.347 --> 00:06:48.427
Go! What are you doing?

00:06:50.427 --> 00:06:52.068
Disperse? No... I'm not...

00:06:52.467 --> 00:06:54.547
Ms. Gao, tell your workers to go home.

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:55.708
- What a disgrace!
- Disperse!

00:06:55.907 --> 00:06:56.748
Go! Move along!

00:06:56.748 --> 00:06:57.427
Let's go.

00:06:59.148 --> 00:06:59.748
M-Mr. Zheng.

00:06:59.828 --> 00:07:00.987
Go home.

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:01.656
- Mr. Zheng.
- Ms. Li.

00:07:01.656 --> 00:07:02.808
- Just go.
- Let's talk over there.

00:07:02.808 --> 00:07:03.628
Mr. Zheng.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.388
Alright. Let's talk later.

00:07:05.388 --> 00:07:05.948
What's wrong?

00:07:05.948 --> 00:07:06.588
Go home!

00:07:06.907 --> 00:07:07.948
Just go.

00:07:09.427 --> 00:07:10.787
Did I see it right?

00:07:17.427 --> 00:07:20.028
Ms. Li, how did you
let things get this bad?

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:22.427
What was the rush?

00:07:23.107 --> 00:07:24.388
I was just securing a client.

00:07:24.787 --> 00:07:26.547
I wasn't flying to Mars, was I?

00:07:26.907 --> 00:07:27.828
Just wait for me.

00:07:28.227 --> 00:07:28.952
Can you wait

00:07:28.952 --> 00:07:30.200
- until I'm back before handling this?
- Mr. Zheng,

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.748
I did intend to wait for you.

00:07:31.987 --> 00:07:33.948
But you never told us specifically
where you went.

00:07:34.068 --> 00:07:35.547
So I had to make the decision first.

00:07:35.787 --> 00:07:37.787
It concerns seven-up, eight-down.
I can't wait.

00:07:38.028 --> 00:07:39.148
Seven-up, eight-down?

00:07:40.188 --> 00:07:41.588
The people of Yuehai

00:07:41.588 --> 00:07:43.307
are up and down now, all because of you.

00:07:43.708 --> 00:07:45.307
I just brought over a major client.

00:07:45.547 --> 00:07:46.987
They are already here.

00:07:47.227 --> 00:07:48.667
Luckily, I ran into Fatty.

00:07:48.948 --> 00:07:50.227
Otherwise, if they see this,

00:07:50.547 --> 00:07:52.227
where could I put my face?

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.828
- What about Yuehai people's dignity?
- You brought these clients here,

00:07:54.867 --> 00:07:57.188
and you're not worried
they'll see the labor violation?

00:07:57.307 --> 00:07:58.667
They came here to do business.

00:07:58.787 --> 00:08:00.467
Who has the time to scrutinize that?

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:02.188
And how does the factory make money?

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:03.907
Isn't it the people?

00:08:03.987 --> 00:08:05.588
This is far from trivial.

00:08:06.148 --> 00:08:07.948
With numerous cases nationwide,

00:08:08.024 --> 00:08:09.880
(Dongjiang Province Government Document)
I can't turn a blind eye to this.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.427
This is like a ticking time bomb.

00:08:11.667 --> 00:08:14.107
If not defused promptly,
it could blow up Yuehai anytime.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.680
(State Council's
Several Policy Stipulations)

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.867
(Concerning Non-Agricultural
Self-Employed Individuals in Urban Areas)

00:08:19.867 --> 00:08:21.828
Even if you don't care
about personal gains,

00:08:22.148 --> 00:08:24.028
what about Yuehai's development?

00:08:24.987 --> 00:08:25.667
Regardless,

00:08:25.907 --> 00:08:27.787
we must temporarily
shut down the factories

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:29.028
exceeding the hiring limit.

00:08:29.268 --> 00:08:30.787
We'll report to the county committee,

00:08:30.948 --> 00:08:33.228
and proceed based on their instructions.

00:08:34.587 --> 00:08:36.468
You said shut down the factories?

00:08:37.427 --> 00:08:39.348
Why not shut down
the Yuehai city construction?

00:08:39.707 --> 00:08:40.367
Li Qiuping,

00:08:40.888 --> 00:08:42.508
do you think you're the only smart one?

00:08:42.707 --> 00:08:43.388
Let me tell you.

00:08:43.907 --> 00:08:46.348
I already knew these documents.

00:08:50.268 --> 00:08:51.547
You knew all along?

00:08:52.748 --> 00:08:55.067
So did Mr. Tan and Mr. Xie

00:08:55.388 --> 00:08:56.748
also know beforehand?

00:08:59.128 --> 00:08:59.827
(Conference Room)

00:08:59.827 --> 00:09:00.667
Today,

00:09:01.508 --> 00:09:03.348
Li Qiuping

00:09:04.348 --> 00:09:05.468
proposed convening a meeting

00:09:05.947 --> 00:09:08.907
specifically to address

00:09:08.988 --> 00:09:12.547
the issue of self-employed individuals
exceeding hiring limits.

00:09:13.388 --> 00:09:15.348
Please speak freely.

00:09:16.028 --> 00:09:16.528
Okay?

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:23.868
You all know the details already.

00:09:25.108 --> 00:09:26.748
My stance is straightforward.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.667
For Yuehai's security,

00:09:29.307 --> 00:09:30.107
I propose

00:09:30.107 --> 00:09:32.787
shut down
the non-compliant factories for now,

00:09:33.028 --> 00:09:35.148
report this to the county committee,

00:09:35.587 --> 00:09:37.468
and await their instructions.

00:09:44.508 --> 00:09:45.468
You've all heard it.

00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:48.427
It's Li Qiuping's opinion.

00:09:48.907 --> 00:09:50.547
Does anyone else have thoughts?

00:09:51.067 --> 00:09:52.628
Speak up. Okay?

00:09:53.187 --> 00:09:53.868
Who goes first?

00:09:57.228 --> 00:09:58.268
Xie Chunlai, you first.

00:10:10.667 --> 00:10:11.307
Mr. Zheng,

00:10:12.947 --> 00:10:15.587
my wife is the director
of Chunmei Printery.

00:10:16.827 --> 00:10:17.784
Discussing matters

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.907
related to Chunmei Printery,

00:10:20.187 --> 00:10:21.108
I should recuse myself.

00:10:21.348 --> 00:10:22.427
You're recused from voting,

00:10:22.587 --> 00:10:24.067
but you can still share your views.

00:10:24.547 --> 00:10:26.427
Then, per Mr. Zheng's request,
I'll be brief.

00:10:28.667 --> 00:10:30.228
Chunmei Printery

00:10:30.268 --> 00:10:31.787
is Yuehai's flagship enterprise,

00:10:32.187 --> 00:10:32.787
right?

00:10:33.427 --> 00:10:34.028
However,

00:10:34.628 --> 00:10:36.587
it also struggles
with inconsistent orders.

00:10:37.028 --> 00:10:38.268
The next order is uncertain.

00:10:39.028 --> 00:10:39.707
Professionally,

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:41.348
as Town Mayor...

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.200
I mean, Deputy Mayor,

00:10:45.108 --> 00:10:47.787
I worry about Yuehai's development.

00:10:48.388 --> 00:10:49.587
If a flagship can't lead,

00:10:49.827 --> 00:10:51.427
smaller businesses have no chance.

00:10:51.748 --> 00:10:53.787
Personally, as head of my household,

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:58.187
I deeply sympathize with my wife,

00:10:58.547 --> 00:10:59.468
Xuemei.

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:02.567
But

00:11:03.064 --> 00:11:04.827
today, Ms. Li and I

00:11:05.268 --> 00:11:06.787
had a thorough discussion.

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:09.427
I've learned

00:11:10.307 --> 00:11:12.307
that we must follow the correct path.

00:11:12.988 --> 00:11:14.307
On Yuehai's development journey,

00:11:14.868 --> 00:11:15.988
however severe the pains,

00:11:22.067 --> 00:11:23.228
they must be endured.

00:11:25.508 --> 00:11:26.348
Yes, exactly.

00:11:26.947 --> 00:11:27.468
That's all?

00:11:27.907 --> 00:11:28.547
I'm done.

00:11:29.656 --> 00:11:30.508
Tan, what about you?

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:33.667
And you?

00:11:34.468 --> 00:11:36.187
Let me add a few words.

00:11:36.827 --> 00:11:39.108
I-I've also been thinking

00:11:40.307 --> 00:11:41.148
that for a factory

00:11:42.707 --> 00:11:44.508
with only seven or eight workers,

00:11:44.947 --> 00:11:46.748
it's practically impossible to expand

00:11:47.388 --> 00:11:48.468
or compete beyond.

00:11:50.028 --> 00:11:52.348
Slightly more orders,
and staff shortages become obvious.

00:11:52.348 --> 00:11:54.268
Here, I must highlight
something important.

00:11:54.868 --> 00:11:57.348
The Party Central Committee said
in the Third Plenary Session

00:11:57.707 --> 00:12:00.307
that we need Reform and Opening-up
and economic revitalization.

00:12:00.827 --> 00:12:02.307
What year was this document from?

00:12:02.707 --> 00:12:04.988
If we're still following it today,

00:12:05.228 --> 00:12:07.067
how can Yuehai develop and progress?

00:12:08.827 --> 00:12:11.028
Ms. Li, let me finish. Don't rush.

00:12:12.307 --> 00:12:14.187
But today, Yuehai Town

00:12:14.427 --> 00:12:17.388
has reached this critical point.

00:12:18.148 --> 00:12:20.468
So I believe

00:12:21.108 --> 00:12:21.907
we should not

00:12:22.748 --> 00:12:23.707
hide problems.

00:12:24.187 --> 00:12:26.148
We should report to higher authorities.

00:12:26.787 --> 00:12:29.508
But I urge everyone
to consider carefully.

00:12:31.067 --> 00:12:32.787
If we shut down

00:12:32.827 --> 00:12:34.427
all these factories,

00:12:35.148 --> 00:12:36.628
what would happen to the workers?

00:12:36.947 --> 00:12:38.187
How do we address the losses

00:12:38.628 --> 00:12:40.187
of these private enterprises?

00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:44.628
Mr. Xie, Mr. Tan,

00:12:45.067 --> 00:12:46.868
your remarks deeply moved me.

00:12:47.427 --> 00:12:48.148
I never expected

00:12:48.388 --> 00:12:51.148
you'd discuss this issue
with such depth.

00:12:52.228 --> 00:12:53.707
You prioritize the greater good

00:12:54.748 --> 00:12:55.988
- and dare to take...
- Ms. Li,

00:12:56.468 --> 00:12:57.468
my apologies.

00:12:57.587 --> 00:12:58.268
Our

00:12:58.988 --> 00:13:00.307
Mr. Lin hasn't spoken yet.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.816
R-Right. Lin.

00:13:01.816 --> 00:13:02.907
Say something.

00:13:05.108 --> 00:13:06.907
I think you all made
some really good points.

00:13:12.307 --> 00:13:12.947
That's all?

00:13:14.187 --> 00:13:15.587
I'm just Yuehai's deputy mayor,

00:13:16.307 --> 00:13:17.988
overseeing urban construction in Yuehai.

00:13:18.707 --> 00:13:20.108
I'll fulfill my duties properly.

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:21.508
You said it best.

00:13:22.187 --> 00:13:22.868
Alright.

00:13:23.468 --> 00:13:25.748
Since everyone's opinions are expressed,

00:13:26.748 --> 00:13:27.480
Li Qiuping,

00:13:28.024 --> 00:13:29.628
do you have any other opinions?

00:13:30.067 --> 00:13:30.868
Please say it.

00:13:31.748 --> 00:13:34.187
I believe our priority
is solving problems.

00:13:34.707 --> 00:13:35.508
Rather than hiding,

00:13:35.947 --> 00:13:38.228
we should promptly report to leadership.

00:13:39.067 --> 00:13:40.827
Let them evaluate and decide.

00:13:41.388 --> 00:13:43.348
Otherwise, if complications arise,

00:13:43.707 --> 00:13:44.868
the consequences

00:13:45.307 --> 00:13:47.907
could be far worse
than halting production.

00:13:49.827 --> 00:13:50.468
Alright then.

00:13:51.187 --> 00:13:52.787
Let's vote, shall we?

00:13:53.628 --> 00:13:55.348
Mr. Zheng, anything to add?

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:58.148
I've said everything needed earlier.

00:13:58.748 --> 00:14:01.307
Let's vote. I respect everyone's views.

00:14:01.628 --> 00:14:02.947
Come on. Let's vote.

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:05.427
Okay.

00:14:06.427 --> 00:14:07.988
Li Qiuping suggested

00:14:08.388 --> 00:14:09.228
notifying

00:14:09.667 --> 00:14:12.587
all Yuehai factories
with more than seven employees

00:14:12.787 --> 00:14:15.587
to temporarily shut down.

00:14:15.787 --> 00:14:16.827
Those in favor, hands up.

00:14:29.787 --> 00:14:31.307
Li Qiuping, you may lower your hand.

00:14:32.028 --> 00:14:33.368
Zheng Decheng suggested

00:14:33.608 --> 00:14:35.187
disapproving the proposal

00:14:35.628 --> 00:14:36.984
of notifying all Yuehai factories

00:14:37.112 --> 00:14:38.827
with more than seven employees

00:14:39.067 --> 00:14:40.468
to temporarily shut down.

00:14:40.787 --> 00:14:41.827
Those in favor, hands up.

00:14:43.512 --> 00:14:44.667
- I'm...
- Put your hand down.

00:14:44.667 --> 00:14:45.348
I'm ineligible.

00:14:47.427 --> 00:14:48.028
Okay.

00:14:49.268 --> 00:14:51.067
Now announcing voting results.

00:14:52.228 --> 00:14:55.067
Results of Yuehai Town
Part committee vote.

00:14:55.707 --> 00:14:57.547
Five expected, five present.

00:14:57.947 --> 00:15:00.707
But Xie Chunlai abstained.

00:15:01.028 --> 00:15:02.827
So four votes counted.

00:15:04.108 --> 00:15:04.667
What?

00:15:06.187 --> 00:15:07.468
Don't you see?

00:15:07.787 --> 00:15:08.427
Ms. Li.

00:15:08.748 --> 00:15:09.587
What does this mean?

00:15:09.667 --> 00:15:11.907
Meng, guard Chunmei Printery.

00:15:11.988 --> 00:15:12.888
Don't let it operate.

00:15:13.067 --> 00:15:13.567
Okay.

00:15:20.728 --> 00:15:21.592
What are you doing?

00:15:21.592 --> 00:15:22.488
What are you doing?

00:15:23.348 --> 00:15:24.868
I'm reporting to the county committee.

00:15:24.868 --> 00:15:25.827
I'm reporting too.

00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.307
Leaders shouldn't hear only your side.

00:15:28.587 --> 00:15:30.307
Mr. Zheng, proper distance
between genders.

00:15:30.628 --> 00:15:31.947
It's inappropriate! Get off.

00:15:32.148 --> 00:15:33.587
If you think it's appropriate, I do.

00:15:36.868 --> 00:15:37.547
Can you ride?

00:15:38.388 --> 00:15:39.307
Slow down.

00:15:40.667 --> 00:15:41.587
If you can't, I can.

00:15:42.468 --> 00:15:43.388
She rides motorcycles?

00:15:44.388 --> 00:15:45.108
Impressive.

00:15:46.148 --> 00:15:48.028
X-Xie,

00:15:48.108 --> 00:15:49.468
what did Mr. Zheng mean?

00:15:50.348 --> 00:15:51.707
Secure the client.

00:15:52.947 --> 00:15:55.512
I'll call Xuemei now
and ask her to give them a tour.

00:15:56.307 --> 00:15:57.868
Tan, you acted well earlier.

00:15:57.907 --> 00:15:58.707
Almost fooled me.

00:15:58.728 --> 00:15:59.228
No.

00:15:59.228 --> 00:16:00.508
I thought you supported closure.

00:16:00.628 --> 00:16:02.468
I wasn't acting. Why would I act?

00:16:02.508 --> 00:16:03.827
Listen. I was not acting.

00:16:03.947 --> 00:16:05.667
Listen. At first, I was very hesitant.

00:16:05.707 --> 00:16:07.187
But the moment I voted, it was clear.

00:16:07.307 --> 00:16:08.667
My analysis was correct, right?

00:16:09.307 --> 00:16:10.547
These outdated regulations

00:16:10.587 --> 00:16:12.108
must be discarded, absolutely,

00:16:12.348 --> 00:16:12.907
right?

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:15.108
Meng, don't cause trouble.
I'm warning you.

00:16:15.587 --> 00:16:16.087
Meng!

00:16:54.587 --> 00:16:55.148
Get off!

00:16:58.268 --> 00:16:58.907
Get off!

00:17:00.827 --> 00:17:02.108
I'm talking to you. Get off.

00:17:09.587 --> 00:17:10.207
Li Qiuping,

00:17:10.648 --> 00:17:12.708
today I'll settle accounts
with you properly.

00:17:14.067 --> 00:17:15.268
Look at you, a young woman,

00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:17.508
delicate and refined.

00:17:18.268 --> 00:17:20.827
People would think you're
reasonable and kind-hearted.

00:17:21.748 --> 00:17:23.268
Who knew you're such a troublemaker?

00:17:24.067 --> 00:17:25.668
I have no grudge against you.

00:17:25.988 --> 00:17:27.587
Why do you insist on opposing me?

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:29.228
Mr. Zheng,

00:17:30.067 --> 00:17:31.028
you still don't get it?

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:32.668
I'm not opposing you.

00:17:32.908 --> 00:17:33.988
I'm helping you.

00:17:34.627 --> 00:17:36.827
Other cities have precedents for this.

00:17:37.147 --> 00:17:39.188
Fines were levied. People were arrested.

00:17:39.508 --> 00:17:41.908
Haven't you realized
the seriousness of this?

00:17:43.587 --> 00:17:45.748
Li Qiuping, before you came,

00:17:46.268 --> 00:17:48.268
this issue didn't even exist
on the surface.

00:17:48.708 --> 00:17:50.067
Perhaps with time,

00:17:50.268 --> 00:17:52.028
a solution would have emerged naturally.

00:17:52.508 --> 00:17:53.228
But now?

00:17:53.827 --> 00:17:55.827
You've turned all of Yuehai upside down.

00:17:56.228 --> 00:17:58.508
A minor issue has become
a colossal problem.

00:18:00.948 --> 00:18:01.448
Fine.

00:18:02.456 --> 00:18:03.448
I can't convince you.

00:18:04.268 --> 00:18:05.147
You have your reasons

00:18:05.387 --> 00:18:06.307
and your principles.

00:18:07.228 --> 00:18:09.188
Even if I face
some punishment over this,

00:18:09.428 --> 00:18:10.028
I'll accept it.

00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:11.948
But I only ask one thing of you.

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:13.147
What?

00:18:13.668 --> 00:18:14.908
Request a transfer yourself.

00:18:15.384 --> 00:18:16.248
You're not welcome.

00:18:16.708 --> 00:18:18.268
Please, never stay in Yuehai anymore.

00:18:34.708 --> 00:18:35.748
Why didn't you get on?

00:18:58.547 --> 00:19:00.787
Li Qiuping's considerations and concerns

00:19:01.508 --> 00:19:02.307
aren't unfounded.

00:19:03.668 --> 00:19:05.748
This matter is indeed quite tricky.

00:19:06.748 --> 00:19:07.428
Mr. Zhao,

00:19:08.468 --> 00:19:10.827
we can't ignore national regulations.

00:19:11.627 --> 00:19:12.428
But...

00:19:15.948 --> 00:19:16.468
Xia, you just

00:19:16.627 --> 00:19:18.748
express your most honest opinion.

00:19:19.228 --> 00:19:19.827
Alright.

00:19:20.587 --> 00:19:21.347
Let me state first.

00:19:21.787 --> 00:19:23.347
I'm not speaking for Zheng Decheng.

00:19:23.708 --> 00:19:25.347
I'm speaking for the golden goose.

00:19:25.748 --> 00:19:27.627
Since Yuehai was built,

00:19:29.028 --> 00:19:31.668
its tax contributions have kept growing.

00:19:32.268 --> 00:19:33.107
At this rate,

00:19:33.387 --> 00:19:34.827
if things run smoothly,

00:19:35.748 --> 00:19:37.428
Yuehai's annual tax revenue

00:19:38.508 --> 00:19:41.067
could exceed half
of our entire county's.

00:19:41.508 --> 00:19:43.468
In the future, Yuehai could very well

00:19:43.787 --> 00:19:46.028
be Pingchuan County's golden goose.

00:19:54.708 --> 00:19:55.908
If production really halts

00:19:56.827 --> 00:19:58.028
and production lines stop,

00:19:58.428 --> 00:20:00.696
who will be responsible

00:20:00.696 --> 00:20:01.508
for Pingchuan's

00:20:02.107 --> 00:20:03.188
future economy?

00:20:05.268 --> 00:20:06.347
That is a question.

00:20:06.428 --> 00:20:08.307
Indeed, it will cause some impact.

00:20:15.387 --> 00:20:17.787
Zheng Decheng's got some nerve.

00:20:18.508 --> 00:20:20.268
He actually played dumb for so long.

00:20:21.627 --> 00:20:23.948
Now Zheng Decheng and Li Qiuping

00:20:24.268 --> 00:20:25.827
are deadlocked over this.

00:20:26.107 --> 00:20:27.736
Shouldn't we

00:20:28.152 --> 00:20:29.228
show them our stance now?

00:20:31.188 --> 00:20:32.387
The labor issue

00:20:33.188 --> 00:20:34.867
is explicitly regulated by the state.

00:20:35.468 --> 00:20:36.867
As cadres,

00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:38.787
we should follow the rules.

00:20:39.668 --> 00:20:40.312
However,

00:20:40.824 --> 00:20:42.827
regulations are rigid,

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.190
yet people are adaptable.

00:20:44.627 --> 00:20:46.587
We still need to make

00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:48.468
flexible adjustments based on reality.

00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:51.672
Xia, I think we need

00:20:51.672 --> 00:20:52.908
to go to the provincial office

00:20:53.347 --> 00:20:54.168
and report this

00:20:54.168 --> 00:20:56.188
to the responsible leaders,

00:20:56.428 --> 00:20:57.708
seeking their instructions.

00:20:57.748 --> 00:20:58.248
Okay.

00:20:58.428 --> 00:21:00.428
Mr. Zhao, it's late now.

00:21:00.668 --> 00:21:01.268
It's fine.

00:21:01.752 --> 00:21:03.347
Leave it to me.

00:21:04.428 --> 00:21:05.748
Yuehai's factories can't wait.

00:21:06.587 --> 00:21:08.587
Before the Provincial Committee
made the decision,

00:21:08.908 --> 00:21:10.147
halt all operations in Yuehai.

00:21:30.387 --> 00:21:32.547
Mr. Zheng, what's going on?

00:21:32.867 --> 00:21:34.787
The county committee
has decided on a shutdown.

00:21:35.228 --> 00:21:37.988
As a Party member cadre,
your family must set an example first.

00:21:38.708 --> 00:21:39.867
But, Mr. Zheng...

00:21:39.908 --> 00:21:40.627
But what?

00:21:41.268 --> 00:21:42.232
The Secretary has agreed

00:21:42.744 --> 00:21:44.228
to solve this problem soon.

00:21:46.827 --> 00:21:49.347
Listen, you need to stay sharp.

00:21:49.508 --> 00:21:51.387
Don't let
the Northeast Five Hus slip away.

00:21:51.867 --> 00:21:54.107
I risked my life drinking
to get them here, got it?

00:21:54.468 --> 00:21:55.147
They won't.

00:21:59.188 --> 00:22:01.948
Then, wishing our collaboration
smooth sailing.

00:22:03.587 --> 00:22:04.147
Okay.

00:22:04.468 --> 00:22:05.347
May it go smoothly.

00:22:05.668 --> 00:22:09.547
Attention, all private enterprises
in Yuehai Town.

00:22:10.668 --> 00:22:11.988
Now, considering

00:22:12.028 --> 00:22:14.387
the widespread issue
of factory overstaffing,

00:22:14.948 --> 00:22:17.428
and in accordance
with the State Council's

00:22:17.468 --> 00:22:19.988
several policy stipulations
concerning non-agricultural

00:22:20.067 --> 00:22:21.988
self-employed individuals
in urban areas,

00:22:22.428 --> 00:22:23.787
the county committee has decided

00:22:23.827 --> 00:22:24.908
that all enterprises

00:22:25.107 --> 00:22:27.468
found to employ workers
beyond the set limit

00:22:27.787 --> 00:22:29.147
must suspend operations for now,

00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:32.760
awaiting authorities'

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.627
next instructions.

00:22:35.147 --> 00:22:36.268
We assure everyone

00:22:37.188 --> 00:22:38.264
that this situation

00:22:38.584 --> 00:22:41.028
won't last long.

00:22:41.867 --> 00:22:42.787
- Right.
- Yes.

00:22:42.787 --> 00:22:44.188
It will not last long.

00:22:44.387 --> 00:22:45.787
Production will resume very soon.

00:22:46.387 --> 00:22:48.547
You see, the leadership
has their reasons, right?

00:22:48.787 --> 00:22:49.587
Come. Take a seat.

00:22:49.668 --> 00:22:50.387
It's okay.

00:22:50.428 --> 00:22:51.387
Wait a second. Hold on.

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:53.827
Ms. Gao, what's happening?

00:22:54.547 --> 00:22:56.468
Please cooperate, everyone.

00:22:57.468 --> 00:22:59.587
Mr. Tan is now

00:22:59.988 --> 00:23:02.587
going to all factories to cut the power.

00:23:03.547 --> 00:23:05.787
Please cooperate.

00:23:06.587 --> 00:23:07.347
Mr. Tan

00:23:07.708 --> 00:23:10.627
is now going to all factories
to cut the power.

00:23:13.067 --> 00:23:13.748
Wait, Ms. Gao.

00:23:14.428 --> 00:23:16.147
Shanghai is waiting for our update.

00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:18.988
Next week, we have to hold
the product launch.

00:23:19.268 --> 00:23:20.867
Yes.

00:23:21.168 --> 00:23:21.668
Well...

00:23:21.668 --> 00:23:24.428
Please don't worry,
clients from the Northeast.

00:23:25.188 --> 00:23:27.948
We will resume production
as soon as possible.

00:23:28.188 --> 00:23:29.708
Yeah.

00:23:30.307 --> 00:23:31.028
No matter what,

00:23:31.307 --> 00:23:35.147
we won't delay clients' orders.

00:23:35.508 --> 00:23:36.067
Yes.

00:23:37.228 --> 00:23:38.547
- It won't affect it.
- Yes.

00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:39.827
The government has said so,

00:23:40.107 --> 00:23:41.627
so it's definitely fine, right?

00:23:41.867 --> 00:23:42.428
Come on.

00:23:42.468 --> 00:23:44.107
You say it won't affect production,

00:23:44.468 --> 00:23:47.067
but how long are we supposed to wait?

00:23:47.387 --> 00:23:49.988
Maybe we should just
cooperate next time.

00:23:50.827 --> 00:23:51.908
No!

00:23:51.988 --> 00:23:53.988
Why should we even consider

00:23:54.147 --> 00:23:55.748
next time?

00:23:56.508 --> 00:23:58.067
We must guarantee

00:23:58.307 --> 00:24:00.748
this current project goes smoothly.

00:24:01.468 --> 00:24:02.428
It'll go smoothly.

00:24:02.688 --> 00:24:03.188
This time.

00:24:03.188 --> 00:24:04.347
Ms. Gao, wait.

00:24:04.668 --> 00:24:05.748
Tell your leaders.

00:24:06.228 --> 00:24:07.347
Don't mess around with me.

00:24:07.668 --> 00:24:08.748
The town government

00:24:09.668 --> 00:24:11.708
always means what it says.

00:24:12.228 --> 00:24:14.228
We don't joke. Take it or leave it.

00:24:16.428 --> 00:24:17.668
S-Such wise leadership.

00:24:18.468 --> 00:24:21.188
Yes. Maybe we should wait a bit longer.
See how things go.

00:24:21.387 --> 00:24:22.680
- Wait a bit.
- See how things go.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.672
A bit longer, okay?

00:24:23.748 --> 00:24:24.347
A favor to you.

00:24:25.307 --> 00:24:26.627
We can stay tonight.

00:24:27.147 --> 00:24:29.827
But tomorrow, we'll wait
no later than 9 AM.

00:24:29.908 --> 00:24:30.408
Yes.

00:24:30.908 --> 00:24:32.028
We hope to hear good news.

00:24:32.668 --> 00:24:33.188
Thank you.

00:24:33.468 --> 00:24:34.028
Okay.

00:24:34.028 --> 00:24:35.307
- Let's have another drink.
- Let's... Yes.

00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:36.028
No. Let's go.

00:24:36.028 --> 00:24:37.560
- Just a little more...
- Hu, just one more drink.

00:24:38.228 --> 00:24:39.028
Hu, another drink.

00:24:39.508 --> 00:24:40.347
Hu, another drink.

00:24:42.067 --> 00:24:42.668
What...

00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:45.587
What's going on?

00:24:49.208 --> 00:24:52.632
(Gao Xuemei)

00:25:08.268 --> 00:25:08.908
Mr. Zhao.

00:25:09.107 --> 00:25:09.627
Mr. Li.

00:25:09.948 --> 00:25:10.508
Mr. Xia.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.280
Mr. Zhang has finished the meeting.

00:25:12.408 --> 00:25:13.468
Please go in now.

00:25:13.867 --> 00:25:14.428
Okay.

00:25:14.867 --> 00:25:15.367
This way.

00:25:15.468 --> 00:25:15.968
Okay.

00:25:18.547 --> 00:25:20.268
Dongsheng, Changyou.

00:25:20.948 --> 00:25:23.228
The investigative report
submitted by Pingchuan

00:25:23.547 --> 00:25:24.587
has been reviewed.

00:25:25.272 --> 00:25:26.808
On behalf of the Provincial Committee,

00:25:27.468 --> 00:25:28.627
I am here to discuss its view

00:25:29.188 --> 00:25:31.428
on excessive hiring
by self-employed individuals.

00:25:38.028 --> 00:25:38.867
(Chunmei Printery)
A decent factory.

00:25:39.387 --> 00:25:40.387
Good price and quality.

00:25:50.107 --> 00:25:50.908
They are leaving.

00:25:51.748 --> 00:25:52.827
- Hu!
- Hurry!

00:25:53.028 --> 00:25:53.908
- Hu!
- Stop them!

00:25:54.147 --> 00:25:57.028
Hu!

00:25:57.948 --> 00:25:59.787
You can't leave! Absolutely not!

00:25:59.787 --> 00:26:00.787
Where are you headed?

00:26:01.948 --> 00:26:02.908
What's going on here?

00:26:03.367 --> 00:26:03.867
Yes.

00:26:03.867 --> 00:26:04.787
I gave you face, right?

00:26:04.908 --> 00:26:05.508
Yes.

00:26:05.587 --> 00:26:07.307
I waited till 9 AM, didn't I?

00:26:07.387 --> 00:26:08.067
Yes.

00:26:08.547 --> 00:26:10.948
I guarantee this situation
won't last much longer.

00:26:10.988 --> 00:26:11.928
Yes.

00:26:11.928 --> 00:26:13.496
- I'm the Town Mayor.
- Yes, our leader.

00:26:15.448 --> 00:26:16.920
The leader from yesterday's radio?

00:26:17.387 --> 00:26:18.188
Yeah, right?

00:26:18.268 --> 00:26:20.028
The leader promised.
Just wait a bit longer.

00:26:20.028 --> 00:26:21.468
- What's the word?
- What's the situation?

00:26:21.468 --> 00:26:23.908
- Let's have another drink.
- It's no big deal, right?

00:26:23.908 --> 00:26:24.508
Another drink.

00:26:24.508 --> 00:26:25.188
Another drink.

00:26:25.428 --> 00:26:27.188
No more drinks.
We've done this four times.

00:26:27.827 --> 00:26:28.984
- Just another drink.
- Mr. Xie.

00:26:30.268 --> 00:26:32.268
Secretary... The Secretary's coming.

00:26:34.067 --> 00:26:35.096
Everything will be okay.

00:26:36.307 --> 00:26:36.807
No.

00:26:36.988 --> 00:26:38.268
I'll take you for a good meal.

00:26:38.627 --> 00:26:39.188
How about it?

00:26:39.428 --> 00:26:39.928
Yes.

00:26:39.928 --> 00:26:40.627
Another drink.

00:26:40.627 --> 00:26:41.127
I'll go.

00:26:41.567 --> 00:26:42.067
No.

00:26:42.067 --> 00:26:42.708
- No.
- Solve.

00:26:42.748 --> 00:26:43.928
- Solve the problem.
- Another drink.

00:26:44.147 --> 00:26:46.547
(Conference Room)
After discussion, the leadership thinks

00:26:47.668 --> 00:26:48.867
the seven-up, eight-down issue

00:26:49.028 --> 00:26:50.627
is a challenge we must confront

00:26:51.107 --> 00:26:52.188
in Reform and Opening-up.

00:26:52.428 --> 00:26:54.268
We can't avoid it
or shirk responsibility.

00:26:54.908 --> 00:26:55.867
We must respond to it.

00:26:56.827 --> 00:26:57.867
Wait. Respond, Mr. Zhao...

00:26:58.028 --> 00:26:58.528
What then?

00:26:58.748 --> 00:26:59.428
What, Mr. Xie?

00:26:59.748 --> 00:27:00.387
That urgent?

00:27:00.508 --> 00:27:01.107
No.

00:27:02.387 --> 00:27:03.627
Our clients are about to leave.

00:27:04.347 --> 00:27:04.867
Yes.

00:27:05.107 --> 00:27:05.708
Resume work.

00:27:06.867 --> 00:27:07.367
Resume work.

00:27:09.428 --> 00:27:10.268
H-He's excited.

00:27:10.668 --> 00:27:12.268
X-Xie, be careful.

00:27:12.347 --> 00:27:13.228
Slow down!

00:27:14.908 --> 00:27:15.708
Have another drink.

00:27:15.948 --> 00:27:16.908
What are you doing?

00:27:17.028 --> 00:27:18.188
Do me this favor.

00:27:18.328 --> 00:27:20.067
- We're resuming work any minute.
- Aren't you tired all this way?

00:27:20.107 --> 00:27:20.908
We'll resume work.

00:27:20.908 --> 00:27:22.547
What should we stay
if work won't resume?

00:27:22.708 --> 00:27:23.208
Move aside!

00:27:23.208 --> 00:27:24.067
Wait a bit longer.

00:27:24.067 --> 00:27:24.567
Let's go.

00:27:25.067 --> 00:27:25.908
Alright.

00:27:26.107 --> 00:27:28.748
Wait a bit longer.
We're resuming work now.

00:27:28.748 --> 00:27:30.908
Work has resumed!

00:27:31.428 --> 00:27:32.387
Work has resumed!

00:27:34.028 --> 00:27:35.107
Work has resumed!

00:27:36.428 --> 00:27:37.627
Work has resumed!

00:27:39.228 --> 00:27:40.107
Work has resumed!

00:27:43.508 --> 00:27:44.188
Work has resumed!

00:27:51.908 --> 00:27:52.748
Work has resumed!

00:27:56.147 --> 00:27:57.787
The committee has reached a consensus.

00:27:58.867 --> 00:27:59.908
They believe...

00:28:00.627 --> 00:28:02.428
If it benefits the people,

00:28:03.668 --> 00:28:05.208
we will uphold it.

00:28:06.104 --> 00:28:06.748
Recognize it.

00:28:07.387 --> 00:28:09.028
If the people dislike it,

00:28:10.587 --> 00:28:11.508
we will modify it.

00:28:13.508 --> 00:28:14.228
Cease it.

00:28:22.547 --> 00:28:24.748
It doesn't matter
if we don't fully understand.

00:28:25.067 --> 00:28:26.428
We can let it develop first.

00:28:27.188 --> 00:28:29.188
And let time render judgment.

00:28:30.147 --> 00:28:31.428
After some time has passed,

00:28:32.028 --> 00:28:33.347
we'll reevaluate the situation.

00:28:35.067 --> 00:28:37.268
Thus, the provincial leaders
repeatedly emphasize

00:28:37.547 --> 00:28:38.457
that practice

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.748
is the sole criterion for testing truth.

00:28:42.147 --> 00:28:43.908
So regarding
the seven-up, eight-down issue,

00:28:44.228 --> 00:28:45.627
we make no decisions.

00:28:46.908 --> 00:28:47.587
No debates.

00:28:49.107 --> 00:28:49.787
No interventions.

00:28:50.668 --> 00:28:51.547
Let it evolve.

00:28:52.867 --> 00:28:53.587
Then

00:28:54.147 --> 00:28:56.757
we'll review it later

00:28:57.016 --> 00:28:57.627
and decide.

00:29:01.468 --> 00:29:02.468
In short,

00:29:03.188 --> 00:29:04.067
seek truth from facts.

00:29:04.508 --> 00:29:06.228
That is the answer from the committee.

00:29:07.347 --> 00:29:07.948
Good.

00:29:08.347 --> 00:29:09.188
Everyone, applaud.

00:29:17.428 --> 00:29:18.107
Alright.

00:29:19.147 --> 00:29:19.647
Enough.

00:29:19.908 --> 00:29:20.547
Too theatrical.

00:29:22.268 --> 00:29:22.867
Everyone,

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:24.307
Yuehai Town

00:29:24.668 --> 00:29:25.948
proactively reported

00:29:26.307 --> 00:29:27.867
the investigation on the labor issue.

00:29:28.627 --> 00:29:31.307
This received affirmation and praise
from provincial leadership.

00:29:31.627 --> 00:29:32.428
They noted

00:29:32.748 --> 00:29:34.748
that when confronting issues,
Yuehai Town's cadres

00:29:35.387 --> 00:29:37.468
remained composed
and avoided impulsiveness.

00:29:38.028 --> 00:29:39.508
They acted with measured calm.

00:29:40.347 --> 00:29:42.228
Here, I must particularly

00:29:42.908 --> 00:29:44.347
commend Li Qiuping.

00:29:44.827 --> 00:29:46.347
I can tell you.

00:29:46.988 --> 00:29:49.188
You owe gratitude to Qiuping

00:29:49.748 --> 00:29:51.228
for defusing this ticking bomb.

00:29:52.428 --> 00:29:55.188
When this matter surfaced,
she stood her ground,

00:29:56.312 --> 00:29:57.304
and knew what mattered.

00:29:58.228 --> 00:29:58.904
Qiuping,

00:29:59.128 --> 00:30:01.067
because you insisted
on reporting this time,

00:30:01.587 --> 00:30:02.497
what was done

00:30:02.497 --> 00:30:04.307
in secret were brought

00:30:04.428 --> 00:30:05.147
into the open,

00:30:05.307 --> 00:30:07.668
even securing directives
from higher authorities.

00:30:08.107 --> 00:30:08.908
It's good.

00:30:10.948 --> 00:30:12.867
When problems arise,

00:30:12.948 --> 00:30:13.988
you must address them

00:30:14.188 --> 00:30:16.067
openly for resolution.

00:30:16.307 --> 00:30:17.428
So production could proceed.

00:30:18.627 --> 00:30:21.468
So let's give Qiuping some applause.

00:30:30.468 --> 00:30:32.268
Mr. Zhao, please reassign her.

00:30:32.748 --> 00:30:34.988
I know you deployed her to monitor me.

00:30:35.347 --> 00:30:37.147
I recognize my shortcomings now.

00:30:37.428 --> 00:30:38.587
I'll improve later, okay?

00:30:38.627 --> 00:30:39.347
I'll be careful.

00:30:39.468 --> 00:30:41.708
No, you're acting coy after benefiting.

00:30:42.708 --> 00:30:43.468
Be grateful.

00:30:43.547 --> 00:30:45.347
Without her, you'd have faced disaster.

00:30:46.107 --> 00:30:47.107
I know.

00:30:47.347 --> 00:30:49.028
But she creates more trouble.

00:30:49.228 --> 00:30:50.147
With cadres like her,

00:30:50.552 --> 00:30:51.748
gentle critiques are useless,

00:30:51.748 --> 00:30:53.347
and harsh words make her hostile.

00:30:53.908 --> 00:30:54.948
It's a tough situation.

00:30:55.147 --> 00:30:57.787
Can't ignore it, can't fix it.

00:30:58.508 --> 00:31:00.387
She's completed
her grassroots training anyway.

00:31:00.668 --> 00:31:01.787
Just recall her back.

00:31:01.908 --> 00:31:03.067
She's just a young woman.

00:31:03.147 --> 00:31:05.188
Why subject her to township hardships?

00:31:05.228 --> 00:31:06.627
Enough nonsense!

00:31:06.867 --> 00:31:08.188
Zheng Decheng, keep this up,

00:31:08.188 --> 00:31:08.988
and you go back.

00:31:09.428 --> 00:31:10.708
Mr. Guan will enlighten you

00:31:10.748 --> 00:31:12.468
on teamwork and shared purpose.

00:31:12.988 --> 00:31:14.028
This is nonnegotiable.

00:31:14.908 --> 00:31:16.147
I'm leaving Li Qiuping to you.

00:31:16.428 --> 00:31:17.827
You have two years

00:31:17.908 --> 00:31:20.188
to cultivate a competent female cadre.

00:31:20.587 --> 00:31:22.307
If she doesn't grow,
you'll answer for it.

00:31:23.188 --> 00:31:24.428
Stop this nonsense.

00:31:24.547 --> 00:31:25.787
You're treating it as a joke!

00:31:32.428 --> 00:31:33.268
Careful. It's hot.

00:31:33.307 --> 00:31:34.147
Okay, thanks.

00:31:37.668 --> 00:31:38.827
Could I get a spoon?

00:31:41.107 --> 00:31:41.748
Sorry.

00:31:42.028 --> 00:31:42.528
Thank you.

00:31:49.787 --> 00:31:51.147
No worries. I'm alone.

00:31:51.228 --> 00:31:53.067
It's fine, Ms. Li. Take this seat.

00:31:54.147 --> 00:31:54.647
Buddy.

00:32:03.736 --> 00:32:05.016
It's already cold.

00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:11.748
(I understand their hatred.)

00:32:12.347 --> 00:32:13.627
(But facing a risky thing)

00:32:13.627 --> 00:32:14.908
(like seven-up, eight-down,)

00:32:15.107 --> 00:32:17.147
(I'd repeat my actions every time.)

00:32:18.708 --> 00:32:20.827
(And as Yuehai's mayor,)

00:32:21.387 --> 00:32:22.776
(making them grasp my intent)

00:32:22.776 --> 00:32:23.827
(is also my job.)

00:32:24.668 --> 00:32:26.867
(No matter how hard it is,
I have to do it.)

00:32:33.708 --> 00:32:35.708
Mom, Ms. Li is here.

00:32:37.787 --> 00:32:38.360
Xuemei.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.480
Ms. Li, you're here.

00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:41.188
What brings you here?

00:32:41.708 --> 00:32:43.827
Nothing. Just passing by.
Thought I'd visit.

00:32:45.787 --> 00:32:48.347
Make yourself comfortable. I'm swamped.

00:32:58.028 --> 00:32:58.587
Hu.

00:32:58.948 --> 00:33:00.347
It's me, Qian from Yuehai.

00:33:00.867 --> 00:33:01.827
Any update on the order

00:33:01.827 --> 00:33:02.787
we discussed last time?

00:33:02.908 --> 00:33:03.992
When should we meet

00:33:03.992 --> 00:33:04.988
to have another drink?

00:33:06.028 --> 00:33:07.147
We're overwhelmed now.

00:33:07.587 --> 00:33:09.188
My workshop's printing nonstop.

00:33:09.547 --> 00:33:10.587
The Northeast batch,

00:33:11.147 --> 00:33:12.508
the one that almost got canceled.

00:33:16.867 --> 00:33:17.748
Wait a few more days.

00:33:17.827 --> 00:33:19.188
Those workers you fired

00:33:19.587 --> 00:33:20.908
will be rehired, right?

00:33:21.827 --> 00:33:23.948
They've scattered. Where to find them?

00:33:35.827 --> 00:33:37.188
Do you have their information?

00:33:37.428 --> 00:33:38.508
Any information helps.

00:33:38.867 --> 00:33:40.028
I'll help you contact them.

00:33:46.668 --> 00:33:49.188
You never actually fired them, right?

00:33:54.587 --> 00:33:56.497
Training skilled workers is grueling.

00:33:56.497 --> 00:33:57.228
Do you know that?

00:33:57.827 --> 00:33:58.708
Could I bear it?

00:34:07.827 --> 00:34:08.547
Come on.

00:34:08.868 --> 00:34:09.747
Ms. Li, water.

00:34:10.267 --> 00:34:10.788
Thanks.

00:34:10.908 --> 00:34:11.788
Have some peanuts.

00:34:12.508 --> 00:34:13.428
Alright, Qian.

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.832
- Price is not an issue.
- This garment will be finished soon.

00:34:17.067 --> 00:34:17.667
Look.

00:34:17.707 --> 00:34:19.627
I gave you such a low price.

00:34:20.428 --> 00:34:21.428
Maybe next time,

00:34:21.468 --> 00:34:22.627
when I come to you,

00:34:22.667 --> 00:34:24.308
give me a chance to treat you to a meal?

00:34:26.067 --> 00:34:27.308
Do you charge for calls here?

00:34:28.147 --> 00:34:28.707
No charge.

00:34:28.988 --> 00:34:30.587
People who come are all townsfolk.

00:34:32.587 --> 00:34:34.227
They tend to be long calls, huh?

00:34:34.788 --> 00:34:36.468
For discussing business,
it's all normal.

00:34:37.147 --> 00:34:40.067
Qian, my dearest Qian.

00:34:41.028 --> 00:34:42.707
Work doesn't matter.

00:34:43.147 --> 00:34:45.187
Having a meal with you is the big deal.

00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:47.707
Have you ever considered

00:34:48.067 --> 00:34:48.988
that making phone calls

00:34:49.528 --> 00:34:50.908
holds business opportunities too?

00:34:51.988 --> 00:34:53.067
The phone here?

00:34:53.828 --> 00:34:54.747
What opportunities?

00:34:55.348 --> 00:34:56.028
Think about it.

00:34:56.468 --> 00:34:58.104
Businesses in Yuehai are diverse.

00:34:58.104 --> 00:34:59.547
All contact the outside world.

00:34:59.948 --> 00:35:00.747
Since it's free,

00:35:01.067 --> 00:35:03.468
you could turn your phone
into a public phone,

00:35:03.788 --> 00:35:06.147
so everyone comes here
to make calls and discuss business.

00:35:06.388 --> 00:35:09.308
Then, business information
would keep pouring in.

00:35:11.627 --> 00:35:13.227
And my business would be more dynamic.

00:35:13.508 --> 00:35:14.028
Yes.

00:35:14.547 --> 00:35:15.908
Since they use your number,

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:17.788
the sales reps
without their own factories

00:35:18.008 --> 00:35:19.928
can affiliate with you to process
their payments

00:35:20.107 --> 00:35:21.107
through your account,

00:35:21.107 --> 00:35:22.747
increasing your transaction volume too.

00:35:23.547 --> 00:35:25.432
Alright. That's a deal then.

00:35:26.988 --> 00:35:27.587
You hang up.

00:35:29.747 --> 00:35:30.747
You hang up first.

00:35:32.267 --> 00:35:33.348
You hang up first.

00:35:34.667 --> 00:35:36.747
What are you doing?
You've been talking forever.

00:35:36.908 --> 00:35:38.227
Almost done, almost!

00:35:38.468 --> 00:35:40.267
Qian this, Qian that. You're hopeless!

00:35:40.908 --> 00:35:42.468
Qian, I need to go now.

00:35:42.508 --> 00:35:43.348
I've got business.

00:35:43.388 --> 00:35:44.107
Call you later.

00:35:44.147 --> 00:35:45.147
Hurry up!

00:35:45.308 --> 00:35:46.547
Done! All done!

00:35:46.547 --> 00:35:47.508
We're discussing things.

00:35:47.587 --> 00:35:48.428
It's finished.

00:35:49.067 --> 00:35:52.028
Ms. Li, will what you said earlier work?

00:35:52.388 --> 00:35:53.747
It'll work. Give it a try.

00:35:55.627 --> 00:35:57.667
It's getting late.
The town meeting starts soon.

00:35:57.788 --> 00:35:58.627
I'll head out first.

00:36:00.067 --> 00:36:01.428
Wait. Hold on.

00:36:01.747 --> 00:36:03.948
Ms. Li, I truly don't know
how to thank you.

00:36:04.707 --> 00:36:05.948
It's nothing special.

00:36:06.308 --> 00:36:07.547
Take it back for sharing.

00:36:07.547 --> 00:36:08.508
- Come on!
- No, thanks.

00:36:08.508 --> 00:36:09.227
Come on. Take it!

00:36:09.348 --> 00:36:10.227
Take it back to eat!

00:36:10.508 --> 00:36:11.508
Here, off you go.

00:36:12.828 --> 00:36:13.468
That's enough.

00:36:13.627 --> 00:36:14.948
Come on. Take it!

00:36:14.948 --> 00:36:15.988
Take it. It's delicious.

00:36:16.408 --> 00:36:19.288
(Conference Room)

00:36:26.187 --> 00:36:27.267
Is everyone here?

00:36:27.667 --> 00:36:28.468
Yuehai efficiency!

00:36:29.828 --> 00:36:30.868
Everyone's here, right?

00:36:31.388 --> 00:36:32.227
Mr. Zheng,

00:36:32.388 --> 00:36:33.227
Ms. Li isn't here.

00:36:33.627 --> 00:36:34.127
Get started.

00:36:34.908 --> 00:36:36.067
There are still two minutes.

00:36:36.107 --> 00:36:37.187
Get on with the business.

00:36:37.468 --> 00:36:38.147
We're all busy.

00:36:38.828 --> 00:36:41.707
Then let's begin today's agenda, okay?

00:36:45.587 --> 00:36:46.428
She's coming.

00:36:58.627 --> 00:37:00.868
Everyone, regarding
the seven-up, eight-down issue,

00:37:01.428 --> 00:37:03.788
I was terrified Yuehai
would face penalties.

00:37:04.267 --> 00:37:06.308
I dragged you all into this trouble.

00:37:06.388 --> 00:37:07.547
No, no trouble at all.

00:37:08.028 --> 00:37:09.428
But I still want to say

00:37:10.067 --> 00:37:11.608
that if this happens again,

00:37:12.152 --> 00:37:13.067
I will still do it.

00:37:46.547 --> 00:37:47.388
The peanuts are good.

00:37:48.147 --> 00:37:48.707
Quite tasty.

00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:51.028
Mr. Zheng, use this.

00:37:51.747 --> 00:37:53.028
Put the peanut shells here.

00:37:53.587 --> 00:37:54.828
Keep things clean.

00:37:55.468 --> 00:37:55.968
Here.

00:37:56.428 --> 00:37:57.028
Ms. Li.

00:37:57.087 --> 00:37:57.587
Here.

00:37:57.587 --> 00:37:58.107
Thanks.

00:37:58.348 --> 00:37:58.868
Lin.

00:37:59.707 --> 00:38:00.428
Xie.

00:38:00.428 --> 00:38:01.308
Come on. Have some.

00:38:01.828 --> 00:38:03.227
Don't just litter peanut shells.

00:38:03.428 --> 00:38:04.107
This smell

00:38:05.868 --> 00:38:06.428
is familiar.

00:38:07.667 --> 00:38:08.828
Brought it from your place.

00:38:13.187 --> 00:38:13.828
Then dig in.

00:38:14.267 --> 00:38:14.868
Then let's

00:38:15.227 --> 00:38:16.187
start the meeting, okay?

00:38:16.227 --> 00:38:16.828
Okay.

00:38:16.868 --> 00:38:19.348
Well, I've run into some trouble.

00:38:20.547 --> 00:38:22.028
I'd like to ask for your advice.

00:38:23.147 --> 00:38:24.547
Up to today,

00:38:25.187 --> 00:38:26.788
Yuehai's total population stands

00:38:27.828 --> 00:38:30.348
at 30,285 people.

00:38:41.707 --> 00:38:42.308
Mr. Zheng,

00:38:43.667 --> 00:38:44.908
didn't you mention a problem?

00:38:46.107 --> 00:38:47.227
This is the problem.

00:38:52.707 --> 00:38:55.267
It was 30,083 last month.

00:38:55.547 --> 00:38:56.227
That means,

00:38:56.587 --> 00:38:59.107
this month Yuehai only grew
by 202 people.

00:38:59.587 --> 00:39:00.667
Averaged out daily,

00:39:01.107 --> 00:39:02.948
less than 10 people come
to Yuehai per day.

00:39:05.587 --> 00:39:06.348
Indeed.

00:39:09.267 --> 00:39:09.988
As for Yuehai,

00:39:10.667 --> 00:39:11.868
from its founding until today,

00:39:12.988 --> 00:39:14.508
it has attracted over 30,000 people.

00:39:14.667 --> 00:39:16.707
But now, that number has stagnated.

00:39:17.067 --> 00:39:18.067
We won't meet our target.

00:39:19.227 --> 00:39:21.627
Don't you think this is a problem?

00:39:23.428 --> 00:39:24.828
Let's hear everyone's thoughts.

00:39:25.147 --> 00:39:26.788
Share your opinions.

00:39:27.587 --> 00:39:28.348
Who goes first?

00:40:00.747 --> 00:40:01.988
I recall there was a document,

00:40:03.028 --> 00:40:04.908
Pingchuan Government Document
No. 1984-2.

00:40:05.428 --> 00:40:07.308
Wait a moment.
I know where that document is.

00:40:08.267 --> 00:40:09.948
When I worked at the county committee,

00:40:10.267 --> 00:40:13.107
that document was approved
and stamped under my purview.

00:40:14.308 --> 00:40:15.147
I remember

00:40:15.988 --> 00:40:17.587
Article Three of that document states

00:40:17.868 --> 00:40:19.587
that it is proposed

00:40:20.147 --> 00:40:21.948
that cadres
of the County Committee Office

00:40:22.107 --> 00:40:24.468
spare no effort in supporting
Yuehai's construction.

00:40:24.868 --> 00:40:27.308
Step one, relocate ten
state-owned factories to Yuehai.

00:40:27.788 --> 00:40:29.707
Step two, propose that

00:40:29.788 --> 00:40:31.227
leading cadres from all county units

00:40:31.707 --> 00:40:34.067
actively respond to Yuehai's call,

00:40:34.308 --> 00:40:35.428
help Yuehai's construction,

00:40:35.707 --> 00:40:37.187
and build homes and businesses here.

00:40:38.948 --> 00:40:39.667
Amazing!

00:40:40.908 --> 00:40:41.828
Word for word.

00:40:49.707 --> 00:40:50.988
Impressive, Ms. Li.

00:40:51.667 --> 00:40:53.627
You have a photographic memory.

00:40:54.308 --> 00:40:56.587
Alright, go ahead and share your idea.

00:40:57.107 --> 00:40:59.547
I think we should have
county committee cadres take the lead.

00:41:00.428 --> 00:41:02.747
If the cadres all come
to Yuehai to build houses,

00:41:02.788 --> 00:41:05.028
it shows Yuehai has promise.

00:41:05.348 --> 00:41:06.547
It has potential to grow.

00:41:07.028 --> 00:41:09.428
Then others will follow suit.

Ms. Li, since you previously worked
in the county,

00:41:22.788 --> 00:41:24.696
you should have dealt with all

the county units.

00:41:26.147 --> 00:41:28.067
It'll make the work easier.

00:41:28.388 --> 00:41:30.707
So I believe this should be assigned
to you to implement.

00:41:30.908 --> 00:41:31.408
Okay?

00:41:31.948 --> 00:41:32.707

But asking me to take the lead on this
