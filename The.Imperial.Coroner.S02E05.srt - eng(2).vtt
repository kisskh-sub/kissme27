=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.380
(This story is entirely fictional.)

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.700
=Episode 5=

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.400
These past few days,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.319
I have uncovered
every Nanzhao spy in the capital.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.660
What did you get out of them?

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.680
Did you find any news about Peacock?

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.599
Except for this Peacock,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.639
I could not trace even a single feather.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.080
However,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.680
Nanzhao recently sent a revered monk.

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:38.719
He is Master Shenguan.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.990
The nobles of the capital hold him
in the highest regard.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.479
Even Consort Hui invited him
to conduct rituals.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.790
Keep a close watch.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.790
Nanzhao may take advantage
of this to stir trouble.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.290
We must not let down our guard.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.100
(Mahavira Hall)

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.159
Master.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.879
I am a member of the household
of Vice Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Rites.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.990
I wish to invite you to our residence
to conduct a prayer ritual for blessings.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.840
(Master Shenguan, eminent monk of Nanzhao)
Benefactor need only hold sincere faith.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.479
The Buddha will surely respond.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.879
Sincere faith?

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.159
My heart is most sincere.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.199
I heard earlier from the young monk that

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.680
(Jing Yuan, disciple of Shenguan)
your prayer services are already fully scheduled.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:33.159
Benefactor,

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.560
my master's prayer rituals
during this visit

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:36.840
are indeed fully booked.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.580
Knowing that master's
great virtue and renown,

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.000
I therefore reported this matter
to Consort Hui.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.000
This is Her Highness's
handwritten letter.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.800
I humbly ask the Master
to grant this request

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.240
for Her Highness's sake.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.759
Benefactor,

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.479
since your heart is truly sincere,

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.439
I shall go.

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.240
Thank you, Master.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.079
Master,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.399
this is ominous.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.839
Enough.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.399
All is fate.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.600
Master,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.000
you sensed it
already outside the temple,

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.879
yet you have always
followed Heaven's will.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.120
Why did you refuse Mrs. Zhao at first?

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.879
This journey to Great Tang

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:34.199
is for one matter of utmost importance.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.480
It concerns both our lives.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.680
I wished to avoid
unnecessary entanglements,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.600
lest they invite

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.160
further complications.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.079
In Great Tang,
keeping exotic pets has become common.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.519
There are even peacocks.

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:53.839
All are tribute animals
sent from various regions.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.839
Now,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.959
this peacock has flown into the temple.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.079
It seems

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.240
there is a rather unusual
karmic cause behind it.

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:04.959
Amitabha.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.360
Do not move.

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:17.480
Move again, and you will die.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.879
Someone as useless as you

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.279
cannot even bring himself
to kill a beast.

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:26.439
There is no point in keeping you alive.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.480
Get lost.

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.879
Father.

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:39.439
I have been training hard in archery,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.319
hoping to contribute
to the royal ambition

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:43.680
as soon as possible.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.300
(You Chongyuan, King of Nanzhao)

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.800
Gao Luoqian has sent word.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.120
Chen'an has reached the outer palace.

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.519
By now,

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:55.959
he should have already entered Chang'an.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.160
My second brother

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:00.839
has never truly seen hardship.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.199
He caused trouble all along the way,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.519
and still took so long
to reach Chang'an.

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:08.720
For nothing, he has shamed Nanzhao.

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:11.720
Whatever grievances you have with him,

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:14.800
he represents the dignity of Nanzhao.

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:17.319
Relations between Great Tang
and Nanzhao are delicate.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.120
At a time like this,

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:21.480
you must not create further trouble.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.519
Yes.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.439
I understand.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.959
There is no need to worry.

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.519
As things stand in Great Tang,

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:30.279
the board has already been laid.

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:33.319
Once the pieces
that must be taken are removed,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.680
this game

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:37.920
will be ours to win.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.079
Father,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.959
I am willing to lead the charge

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.399
and fight on your behalf.

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:50.160
Longsheng,

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.560
everything I am doing now,

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.680
who do you think it is for?

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.759
Do you truly not understand?

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:00.759
I understand.

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.879
The chief envoy of Nanzhao
delayed the Emperor's birthday,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.319
and indeed angered the Tang Emperor.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.079
This welcome banquet

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:12.519
was arranged rather hastily.

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:14.800
Commandery Prince An did attend.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.399
Whether it was to save face

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.920
or to guard against Nanzhao

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.519
is hard to say.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.839
I heard that

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.000
this chief envoy has quite a background.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.990
He is the adopted son
of the King of Nanzhao.

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:27.480
Sent to Great Tang
at such a sensitive moment,

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:28.800
what else could his purpose be?

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.439
An adopted son?

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:32.199
Only one born of blood is truly a son.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:32.959
Come.

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:36.800
- Good.
- Good.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.180
- Good.
- Good.

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:42.120
Father,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.879
the plump sheep I hunted yesterday

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.519
was specially marinated.

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:48.279
It was slow-roasted
over a gentle fire for hours.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.079
Please have a taste.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.879
You're thoughtful indeed.

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:53.199
Come.

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:54.399
Dine with me.

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:21.490
The flavor is excellent.

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:24.279
Second Prince,

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.560
you have come from afar.

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:27.879
Though you missed
the Emperor's birthday,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.720
this still represents Nanzhao's

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.759
gesture of sincerity toward Great Tang.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.879
I am

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.519
Huang Lv, Vice Minister of Rites.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.480
I gladly drain this cup

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.320
to honor the Second Prince.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.519
Did you hear that?

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:46.879
Every word
from the Vice Minister of Rites

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:49.120
implies that Nanzhao
stands in awe of Great Tang.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.240
This cup of wine

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.600
is not an easy one to drink.

00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:59.080
Back then,

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.519
your second brother

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:03.039
was suddenly brought
back to the Nanzhao royal court,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.240
and became a thorn
in many people's eyes.

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:08.399
They tripped him openly and in secret.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.159
As his father,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.799
I never intervened.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.559
He clenched his teeth

00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:15.759
and survived on his own.

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:19.360
This time,
he arrived safely in Chang'an.

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:20.360
That proves

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:23.159
his life was not meant to end.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.039
Yes.

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:27.759
Nanzhao and Great Tang
border each other,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.559
their fates closely bound.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.639
As a prince of Nanzhao,

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.039
I come under royal command.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.840
This cup of wine

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.400
should be offered by me
to all the honored ministers,

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:39.440
to show Nanzhao's

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.399
desire for goodwill.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.759
Please.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:50.799
Father.

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:53.000
I could also be sent as an envoy.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.279
Do you really think
that is an easy assignment?

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:56.559
If you went,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.080
the Tang Emperor would hold the knife,

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.320
and you would be meat
on his chopping block.

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:01.159
Besides,

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.519
you are a prince.

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:04.039
How could you be sent as an envoy?

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:06.879
It is an honor to meet a prince
of Nanzhao here in Great Tang.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:08.240
A pleasure to meet you.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.720
Xinluo and Nanzhao are separated
by mountains and seas.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.679
I hope that one day
we may pass through Great Tang

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.039
to serve as envoys to Nanzhao.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.080
How interesting.

00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:24.639
It seems Gao Luoqian
shows little concern

00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:26.720
for his own Second Prince.

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:29.879
More than that.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.960
He wants You Chen'an to struggle
at every step in Great Tang.

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:35.519
Sending the second one this time

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:37.879
was also meant to test

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.120
the Tang Emperor's attitude.

00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:40.090
These foreign envoys

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:42.759
seem rather interested
in the Second Prince of Nanzhao.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.360
After all, today's Nanzhao

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.120
is no longer what it once was.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.039
I have another important task

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.279
that I will entrust to you.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.039
Father, please give your orders.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.559
Whether You Chen'an
is merely a decoy or not,

00:10:56.879 --> 00:10:58.639
Nanzhao's wolfish ambition

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:00.679
is plain for all to see.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.039
We wait for the right moment,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.639
then strike Jiaozhou.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.399
Yes.

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:06.960
Come, let me toast the Second Prince.

00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:07.960
My lords,

00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:09.990
on another day I will host a banquet

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.120
to properly entertain you all.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.840
Are you looking down on us, then?

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.380
Second Prince has not yet
recovered from his cold.

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:18.360
He should not drink much.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.559
You gentlemen are so eager
to show hospitality

00:11:20.919 --> 00:11:22.100
that you may not have noticed.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.000
A mere cold...

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:26.440
Lord Qin, you have had too much to drink.

00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:28.279
Go back and get some rest.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.759
I was too focused on watching
the Second Prince enjoy himself.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.950
I drank a bit too much
and my head is aching.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.360
My apologies. Please forgive me.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.639
If Second Prince wishes to change,

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:43.480
I can have someone escort you.

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:47.519
This cup, my thanks to Commandery Prince An
for stepping in.

00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:55.360
And this one,

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.300
to thank Your Highness
and the Princess Consort for saving my life.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.720
What I did was simply my duty.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.279
As for the Princess Consort's wine,
I will drink it in her stead.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.080
I never expected
that on this mission to Great Tang,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.039
I would meet someone
truly worth befriending.

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:30.000
What are you looking at?

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:32.720
You're back.

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:36.399
You've been drinking?

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.679
Just one cup.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.399
Did something happen at the banquet?

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.120
Why did even you have to drink?

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:44.879
Come.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.080
I will explain it slowly.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.360
There's always a sense about him,
like he's used to enduring everything.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.879
Yet he is still
the Second Prince of Nanzhao.

00:12:57.919 --> 00:12:59.440
How did his life end up so miserable?

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.559
Struggles for the throne

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.879
are full of brothers
turning on one another,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.320
of blood ties becoming weapons.

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:05.919
What's more,

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.519
a Second Prince appeared out of nowhere,

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:10.679
without noble blood,

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.559
yet forced into a noble identity.

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:14.600
Clearly,

00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:17.159
he is nothing more than a whetstone

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.160
the King of Nanzhao
prepared for You Longsheng,

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.279
or rather,

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:22.480
a shield.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.230
You Chen'an must understand
the King of Nanzhao's intentions

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.600
very well.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.799
He knows that at any moment,
he could be sacrificed.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.000
That's why he struggles to survive,

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.450
finding a way out through the cracks.

00:13:34.919 --> 00:13:36.200
You're perceptive.

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:37.919
After all I've said,

00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:40.200
shouldn't I be rewarded?

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.120
You smell of wine. Go bathe first.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.399
No hurry.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.519
Hurry.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.279
So many things
have been in chaos lately,

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.350
and the coroner work at the Three Judicial Offices
has been delayed again.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:53.559
Oh, right.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.679
I am on duty tomorrow.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.399
I should make proper preparations.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.820
(Body Preparation Room)

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.679
Everyone's busy.

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:08.480
Princess Consort.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.080
You are finally back.

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:12.519
The Three Judicial Offices
have piled up many cases lately.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.180
They are all waiting
for your examination.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:14.799
Yes.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.890
Recently, the night curfew
in the capital was lifted,

00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:17.860
and murders have increased.

00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:19.770
The ways people died
are all kinds of strange.

00:14:19.879 --> 00:14:21.080
This was indeed my oversight.

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:21.960
All right.

00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:23.159
Leave everything to me.

00:14:29.679 --> 00:14:30.240
Your Highness.

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:31.200
The meal is ready.

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:33.960
Today's braised pork

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.200
turned out especially well.

00:14:36.159 --> 00:14:36.900
Look at this meat.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.790
Where is the Princess Consort?

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.240
Performing an autopsy.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.679
The Princess Consort said
the body was already in pieces.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.200
If she does not examine it now, it will not
even be stitched back together.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.759
Vice Minister, this food
does not suit your appetite?

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.340
(Body Preparation Room)

00:15:22.039 --> 00:15:22.840
Wash your hands.

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:39.240
What is this?

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:41.039
It is fermented tofu.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.080
Does it smell unpleasant?

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.759
Yes.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.559
But it reminds me that

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.890
there are still two corpses that will start
to rot if we do not examine them soon.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.279
You have been examining bodies
for 18 hours straight.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.320
We are short-handed.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.190
Even if you exhaust yourself,
you cannot finish everything.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.840
Why not solve the problem at its root?

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.919
At the root?

00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:01.840
How do we do that?

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.990
The Three Judicial Offices
are recruiting new people these days.

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:07.400
Why not go and see
if there are suitable candidates?

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.830
Bring them in, and have them all placed
under your command.

00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:11.519
Under my command?

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:13.840
Can I really manage them well?

00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:17.320
I believe you absolutely can.

00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:19.559
You have solid,
professional coroner skills,

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.559
a fair and rigorous
approach to investigations,

00:16:21.879 --> 00:16:23.279
and a genuinely kind heart.

00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:24.600
You are that capable.

00:16:25.159 --> 00:16:26.919
Do you not want to guide more coroners,

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.000
and help the world

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.440
change how it sees this profession?

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:31.840
Mm.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.919
You are right.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.759
I need to recruit people.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.159
More coroners, and better ones.

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:44.480
This test focuses
on reconstructing the scene.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.280
We need coroners who can truly help
restore what happened at the scene,

00:16:48.519 --> 00:16:50.240
not those limited to autopsies alone.

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:52.480
That makes sense.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.160
The direction of blood flow here
runs opposite on the thigh and the calf.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.079
What does that tell us?

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:10.730
It shows the deceased

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.560
was not standing upright
in a normal posture.

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.720
If the head was lowered like this,

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.799
then the shape
of the blood drops makes sense,

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.359
and the posture analysis holds.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.200
This is the most basic type of scene,

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:45.240
yet not a single person

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.880
managed to reconstruct it fully.

00:17:47.839 --> 00:17:49.240
For a coroner,

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:51.039
the autopsy itself is fundamental.

00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:53.240
But to truly reconstruct a case,

00:17:53.279 --> 00:17:55.990
one must possess both forensic skill
and investigative insight.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.590
Perhaps my standards are too demanding.

00:17:58.319 --> 00:17:59.519
But you can do it.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.920
That is only because I was fortunate.

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:03.680
I had someone guide me,

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.720
someone who taught me patiently.

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:06.640
In truth,

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:08.599
for many coroners today,

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.720
entering this profession
at all is difficult.

00:18:11.519 --> 00:18:12.559
Let alone...

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.240
From what you are saying,

00:18:16.119 --> 00:18:17.640
you already have someone in mind.

00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:20.559
Unqualified is unqualified.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:22.920
Back when I took the examination,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.839
I did not pass
the coroner selection either.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.390
The reason I was able to enter
the Three Judicial Offices

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.680
was because I trained
under Your Highness for some time.

00:18:30.079 --> 00:18:30.880
So,

00:18:31.359 --> 00:18:32.640
could we also

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.100
first select some promising candidates
into the Three Judicial Offices,

00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:36.400
guide them and teach them,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.790
and let the Three Judicial Offices

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.759
cultivate our own group
of outstanding coroners?

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.180
(Two Merits Hall)

00:18:45.519 --> 00:18:47.839
For today's recruitment of coroners,

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.160
no one passed.

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:51.160
Not a single one.

00:18:52.759 --> 00:18:54.920
In truth, everyone here has more or less

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.880
grasped some basic knowledge.

00:18:57.119 --> 00:19:00.680
What they lack is hands-on practice
and deeper training.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:01.920
Therefore,

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:03.839
after discussing this
with Commandery Prince An,

00:19:04.079 --> 00:19:05.160
if everyone is willing,

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.119
you may first enter
the Three Judicial Offices as apprentices,

00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:11.119
and study
under suitable senior coroners.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.390
- There is a chance.
- There is a chance.

00:19:12.759 --> 00:19:14.279
On the tables in front of you,

00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:16.599
are the profiles
and strengths of each coroner.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.119
You may choose for yourselves.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.920
Allow me to recommend myself.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.039
The registration desk
in the middle is mine.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:22.960
I also truly hope

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.599
to share my experience and methods

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.559
with everyone.

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:28.039
You may begin registering now.

00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:33.559
Imperial gift.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.359
The Imperial Coroner must be formidable.

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:36.640
Brother, think carefully.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.300
She is, after all,
the Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:19:38.319 --> 00:19:41.060
That title likely carries the weight
of Commandery Prince An's influence.

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:41.640
Exactly.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.359
Get too close, and there will be gossip.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.359
Keep too much distance,

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:45.519
and you learn nothing.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.240
In the end,
you might gain nothing at all.

00:20:28.599 --> 00:20:29.400
What is wrong?

00:20:30.279 --> 00:20:31.079
You look unhappy.

00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:34.079
I know, actually,
being a coroner is difficult.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.720
Being a female coroner is even harder
to be acknowledged.

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:41.039
But when no one chose me,
it still hurts.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.319
Come here.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.400
We have solved so many cases together.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.839
I truly feel

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.680
that I am quite capable.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.960
Yet they still think
I am not good enough,

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:00.920
that the title of The Imperial Coroner

00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:03.500
belongs to the Commandery Princess
Consort An, not to myself.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.039
People are always suspicious.

00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:07.279
We only need to keep doing our best.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.680
One day,

00:21:09.599 --> 00:21:11.880
the rivers we crossed
and the mountains we climbed

00:21:12.519 --> 00:21:15.119
will become paths
that guide others forward.

00:21:18.039 --> 00:21:18.920
You are right.

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:21.440
I do not need
to prove my ability to anyone.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.279
I only need to do my part,

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.010
and help everyone I can,

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.839
everyone who truly wishes
to become a coroner.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.759
One day,

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.359
they will see what I am capable of.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.119
Still, it does make me sad.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.410
Then let yourself feel sad
for a little longer.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.519
Official matters

00:21:39.599 --> 00:21:40.519
can wait for a moment.

00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:43.880
I am fine now.

00:21:44.119 --> 00:21:45.230
What were you about to say?

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.890
At present, the Ministry of Justice

00:21:49.319 --> 00:21:51.160
and the local prefectures
all lack coroners.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.799
Among the people,

00:21:53.119 --> 00:21:54.799
there must be those like you,

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.599
who truly aspire to this work.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.559
So I was thinking

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.079
of arranging a special apprentice
recruitment just for you.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.160
Then let us relax the requirements
and post notices across the city.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.640
Regardless of age or gender,

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.279
anyone who passes the basic assessment

00:22:07.319 --> 00:22:09.640
and is determined to become a coroner
may study under me.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:10.400
What do you think?

00:22:13.519 --> 00:22:14.559
I agree.

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:17.880
He?

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.036
(Notice. The Three Judicial Offices
seek coroners. Talents wanted.)

00:22:21.036 --> 00:22:23.400
(Positions open for reserve selection.
Generous terms.)

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.240
The renowned Imperial Coroner herself

00:22:25.279 --> 00:22:27.480
is recruiting apprentices
from among the people.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.359
Anyone may go and try.

00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:30.480
The terms are generous.

00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:32.640
Isn't that
the Imperial Coroner's brother?

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.440
That's right.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.260
When my sister
first began studying as a coroner,

00:22:35.279 --> 00:22:36.480
I was the one who guided her.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:37.990
Anyone who wants to learn from my sister

00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:39.680
must first earn my approval.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.000
And how does one earn your approval?

00:22:42.039 --> 00:22:43.400
The Chu Family Pharmacy ahead

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.740
is run jointly by me
and the authorities.

00:22:44.759 --> 00:22:46.200
Come support my shop more often,

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.000
and my approval will come naturally.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.480
Do give me your patronage.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:51.880
Much obliged.

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:52.799
Thank you for the support.

00:22:52.799 --> 00:22:53.340
Of course.

00:22:58.519 --> 00:22:59.319
An.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.240
He.

00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:01.039
An.

00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:03.508
(Chu Family Pharmacy)
I heard back in Nanzhao

00:23:03.508 --> 00:23:04.559
(Chu Family Pharmacy)
that you were already calling the shots.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.240
I never expected to run into you here.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:08.890
Thinking back, three years ago,
when I was trading medicinal herbs,

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.519
I passed through Nanzhao and met you.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.240
It was you who introduced me
to the King of Nanzhao,

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.950
which allowed me
to take on the commission

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.000
of supplying medicine
to the Imperial Pharmacy.

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:19.240
I never properly thanked you.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.100
There's no need.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:21.390
If you had
not looked after me back then,

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.920
near the Qianzhou border,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.790
I would never have survived
to enter the palace.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.720
Your kindness was like
a spring in drought.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.390
What I returned was
but a drop in response.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:29.960
Still,

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.640
you had been doing well
in that position.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.119
Why come to Chang'an?

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.240
I could never quite stop worrying
about my sister.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.359
I wanted to be closer to her.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.560
She was alone in the capital,

00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:43.680
with no family by her side.

00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:44.960
I simply could not rest easy.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.240
So I came without telling her,

00:23:46.319 --> 00:23:48.480
all the way to Chang'an, to be near her.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:58.839
Take it slow, everyone.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.759
One at a time.

00:24:00.519 --> 00:24:01.480
Line up properly.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.200
Leng Yue.

00:24:04.039 --> 00:24:04.759
Come here, quick.

00:24:06.039 --> 00:24:06.720
See that?

00:24:06.799 --> 00:24:08.359
All these people came because of you.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.910
Where did you
even find this many people?

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.720
Exactly.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.720
I never expected so many people
to be interested in examining bodies.

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:23.359
Are you all right?

00:24:25.359 --> 00:24:26.720
Half the face is gone.

00:24:32.559 --> 00:24:33.880
This smell is unbearable.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.839
Not becoming a coroner

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.920
must mean my ancestors
are watching over me.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:37.799
Let's go.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.200
Mother.

00:24:41.359 --> 00:24:42.440
Mother, I can't do this.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.640
Being a coroner
is not something humans should do.

00:24:48.559 --> 00:24:49.160
Um…

00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:57.599
Are you all right?

00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.720
Do you still want to take the exam?

00:25:03.119 --> 00:25:03.720
Your Highness.

00:25:03.839 --> 00:25:05.319
Could I avoid dissecting the body?

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.060
I could stay nearby

00:25:06.079 --> 00:25:07.119
and help you instead.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.540
Serving tea, running errands, anything.

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:10.119
Didn't you come to test for coroner?

00:25:10.359 --> 00:25:12.880
I was talked into it by
the Commandery Prince's brother-in-law.

00:25:13.079 --> 00:25:13.920
He told us

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.039
this was
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.920
Good monthly pay,
food and lodging included.

00:25:18.039 --> 00:25:18.799
Who knows,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.390
maybe we'd rise through the ranks
and enter official service.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.680
My brother
really went too far this time.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.519
He was worried about you and meant well.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.559
Still, what a useless bunch.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.710
- Not a single one stayed.
- He.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.890
Those who gather for profit drift apart
when profit is gone.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.119
Those who gather for power scatter
when power fades.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.320
If you rely only on rank
and rewards to recruit people,

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.480
you will never find those
truly devoted to the work.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.759
I understand.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.720
Girl, in a few days at the pharmacy,

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.490
I will prepare
your favorite Qianzhou dishes.

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:52.400
Come eat then.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.590
I have also invited
an old acquaintance from Qianzhou.

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:55.599
An old acquaintance?

00:25:56.559 --> 00:25:58.880
You know others in Chang'an besides us?

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:00.039
An old friend of mine.

00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:01.119
You know him as well.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.000
Girl, I just wanted you to help An a little,

00:26:05.039 --> 00:26:06.240
and mention a word or two.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.400
It is nothing serious.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.000
Why did you insist on dragging me here?

00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:10.160
Come on.

00:26:13.279 --> 00:26:13.920
What is it?

00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:16.559
It concerns
the Second Prince of Nanzhao.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.670
Back when my brother
was stationed near the Qianzhou border,

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.400
he happened to know You Chen'an.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.480
You know You Chen'an?

00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:24.440
When I knew him,

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.039
he was not yet
the Second Prince of Nanzhao.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.079
What do you mean?

00:26:31.119 --> 00:26:32.000
These matters,

00:26:32.119 --> 00:26:33.640
I only heard from An.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.119
Many years ago,

00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:37.480
the King of Nanzhao
once inspected the royal stud.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.440
After a banquet, the King of Nanzhao
was heavily drunk.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.759
At that moment,

00:26:43.799 --> 00:26:46.759
An's mother, then a stablewoman
tending the horses, passed by.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.759
The King of Nanzhao dismissed everyone.

00:26:52.599 --> 00:26:54.680
He violated An's mother by force.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.240
When the King of Nanzhao sobered up,

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.000
he despised
the stablewoman's low status,

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:03.480
and refused
to grant An's mother any standing.

00:27:03.759 --> 00:27:06.759
Even toward An, he showed not
the slightest fatherly affection.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.000
In the end,

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.680
he abandoned the mother
and child at the hunting grounds,

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.599
and never looked back.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.319
An's mother raised him there,

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.440
the two of them scraping by
with great hardship.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.790
But life
at the hunting grounds was harsh.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:18.880
In the end, his mother

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.119
sent him to relatives
in Qianzhou to be fostered.

00:27:21.759 --> 00:27:22.920
It was during that time

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.079
that An and I came to know each other.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.640
So that is what happened.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.880
Why did you never tell me
any of this before?

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.839
I promised An back then
that I would keep it secret.

00:27:32.319 --> 00:27:33.759
No wonder You Longsheng

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.279
hates him to the core,

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.559
and wants nothing more than his death.

00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:39.680
And it explains why You Chen'an

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.519
grew up learning to endure and yield.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.279
Your Highness,

00:27:43.559 --> 00:27:44.960
this is no small matter.

00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:47.039
The implications are enormous,

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.799
touching both our court and Nanzhao's.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:50.960
It must be reported.

00:27:55.839 --> 00:27:57.079
Blood of one's own flesh?

00:27:58.079 --> 00:27:59.039
What do you all think?

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.759
It is said the Eldest Prince's
maternal family wields great power,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.990
having encroached on the interests
of many veteran officials.

00:28:04.319 --> 00:28:06.799
Those old ministers unwilling
to serve the Eldest Prince

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.470
now urgently need to rally behind

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.839
a faction of their own.

00:28:10.119 --> 00:28:10.880
Second Prince

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.599
is the most suitable choice.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.079
He seeks neither power

00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:15.240
nor personal gain.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.920
When the time comes, if we lend
the Second Prince measured support,

00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:21.319
it will not only be

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.839
timely aid to him in dire straits,

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.240
but also serve
to restrain the Nanzhao court.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.279
Indeed.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.190
If turmoil breaks out
within the Nanzhao court,

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.920
they will have no energy left
to stir trouble along the border.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.319
In that case,

00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:36.839
the people of our frontier regions
may enjoy more years of peace.

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:37.850
Your Majesty,

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.870
it is rare for the Nanzhao delegation
to enter the capital,

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.279
and they were delayed along the way.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.480
Why not have them remain
in Chang'an a few more days,

00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:46.640
so they may properly observe
the splendor of Great Tang?

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:49.160
Xiao Jinyu,

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.359
what is your view?

00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:53.359
Your Majesty,

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.160
I have concerns.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
You Chen'an does not seem

00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:58.910
as helpless as rumors
from the Nanzhao court suggest,

00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.890
someone easily bullied.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.039
Explain further.

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:02.720
He was born of humble origin,

00:29:03.319 --> 00:29:05.480
and from a young age learned
to endure and submit.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.480
On the surface he appears weak,

00:29:07.799 --> 00:29:10.400
seeking only self-preservation,
yet it is hard to tell for now

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:11.799
whether he harbors other designs.

00:29:12.359 --> 00:29:13.400
Moreover, in recent days,

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:15.990
a large number of Nanzhao outsiders
have slipped into the city in secret.

00:29:16.519 --> 00:29:18.519
In the open,
there is also Master Shenguan,

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.759
a figure revered by the common people.

00:29:21.599 --> 00:29:23.839
His movements are unclear,
his intentions unknown.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.240
Therefore, in dealing
with this Second Prince,

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.119
we must proceed with the utmost caution.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.440
No matter.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.920
He is but a prince.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.340
Since the King of Nanzhao
dares to place this Second Prince

00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:36.519
openly on the board,

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:39.359
we have no reason to refuse the move.

00:29:39.799 --> 00:29:42.720
Let us first host the Second Prince
as a guest of Great Tang.

00:29:43.119 --> 00:29:44.190
As for the rest of the game,

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.400
we can play it out at leisure.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.440
As of today,
the Second Prince of Nanzhao,

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.640
You Chen'an, is noted for a gentle
and steady disposition,

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.630
with broad-minded conduct
and refined bearing.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.519
He is hereby granted leave
to move freely within the capital.

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:01.359
He shall observe our customs,

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.920
and study the ways of Great Tang.

00:30:03.279 --> 00:30:04.960
This decree is hereby issued.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.640
Father.

00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:14.599
I believe the Tang Emperor

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.079
harbors no good intentions at all.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.240
He is clearly keeping
a hostage in Chang'an.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.680
If my second brother is manipulated,

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.039
I fear it may
disrupt Father's entire design.

00:30:25.319 --> 00:30:27.599
I have already seized the key
to breaking the deadlock.

00:30:28.279 --> 00:30:30.559
Great Tang's ranks
of generals are thin now.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.150
The only one
they can send against Nanzhao

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.480
is the Cavalry General,

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.519
Xie Huaiding.

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:35.519
If we pin him down,

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.359
then Great Tang

00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:38.559
will have no commander
left capable of battle.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.759
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.359
Not a single one was willing
to stay and learn.

00:30:57.279 --> 00:30:58.759
I was too eager.

00:31:02.039 --> 00:31:02.839
Perhaps

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.920
I was not fully prepared myself.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.680
Who is there?

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.130
It is only that fate
has not yet arrived.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.279
Why are you here?

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.750
Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:28.720
I originally came to thank you in person

00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:30.000
for saving my life,

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.200
but I could not find you.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.559
The guards at the gate
said I might wait here,

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.890
so I took the liberty of coming in.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.690
I did not break any rules, did I?

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.680
It is fine.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.190
Today's cases have already
been examined and sent away.

00:31:42.519 --> 00:31:43.160
Still,

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:44.880
you waited here alone just now.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.559
This is the autopsy room.

00:31:47.079 --> 00:31:47.920
Were you not afraid?

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.759
At times, I feel

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.810
being among the dead is more reassuring
than being among the living.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.880
What I mean is,

00:31:58.210 --> 00:31:59.599
if there is a chance in the future,

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.160
I hope I may come here often.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.759
He and I go way back.

00:32:04.039 --> 00:32:05.200
We are as close as family.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.839
He often mentions you

00:32:07.119 --> 00:32:07.839
to me.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.799
Then I suppose
he did not praise me much.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.279
He always says

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.119
you are the pride of the Chu family,

00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:16.440
one of the finest coroners

00:32:16.559 --> 00:32:18.000
in the realm.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.720
That is what he said?

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.319
Of course.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.000
It was after hearing him speak of you

00:32:24.039 --> 00:32:25.200
at the pharmacy that day

00:32:25.359 --> 00:32:26.319
that I came up with

00:32:27.839 --> 00:32:29.079
a rather presumptuous idea.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.000
What kind of idea?

00:32:32.319 --> 00:32:33.119
I wish to

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.360
take the Princess Consort of An
as my teacher,

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.160
and learn the art of a coroner from you.

00:32:39.559 --> 00:32:41.160
You want to learn how to be a coroner?

00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:42.000
Yes.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.240
I already have some
basic knowledge of examination,

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.519
and I have long been interested
in this line of work.

00:32:46.839 --> 00:32:49.160
It is just that before,
I never found a suitable teacher.

00:32:49.599 --> 00:32:52.599
But if I could study under
one of the finest coroners in the land,

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.990
it would truly be
an honor beyond measure.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.039
Come with me.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.880
This was the test from a few days ago.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.039
Take a look.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.920
Try to reconstruct the scene.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.420
(Techniques are professional)

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:17.700
(Steps are well structured)

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.020
(Observation is meticulous)

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.599
Bruising on the chest.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.540
(Assessment is accurate)

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.079
The blood flow patterns
on the thigh and calf run opposite.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:37.559
There are abrasion marks
within the bloodstains on the skin.

00:33:37.559 --> 00:33:38.820
(Reasoning is clear)

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.119
This would only occur while squatting.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.580
The victim died in a squatting position.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:44.990
Then what about the killer's clues?

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.519
None of these are
the real traces left by the killer.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.799
These were traps you set, weren't they?

00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:57.960
How so?

00:33:59.119 --> 00:33:59.680
Here.

00:34:00.359 --> 00:34:02.119
This is where the killer
truly left a trace.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.480
(Eliminating distractions.)
The bloodstains here differ from all the others.

00:34:05.079 --> 00:34:06.240
The droplets show a spray pattern.

00:34:06.519 --> 00:34:07.319
And then?

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.119
And then…

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.599
That is as far as I can tell.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.599
This is all I can see.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:23.599
I know my brother's ability

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.960
to teach and guide others.

00:34:27.519 --> 00:34:30.440
As for me, I have seen injuries
and mutilation since childhood.

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.990
I myself have never
been free of wounds, large or small.

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.390
You could say long illness
makes a good healer.

00:34:36.039 --> 00:34:37.000
Learning more

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.390
was also my way of protecting myself
when it truly mattered.

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:40.440
No wonder.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.800
When I watched you examine the body
just now, your technique was very clean.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.119
You seem especially familiar
with the structure of the human body.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.760
Do you have some special method?

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.159
I do.

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.780
(Anatomical charts of bones and organs)

00:35:06.719 --> 00:35:09.119
These charts
are my most treasured possession.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.920
I never lend them to anyone.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.990
But if Your Highness
is willing to take me as your disciple

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.270
and allow me to enter
the Three Judicial Offices to learn real skills,

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.559
then once I have made progress,

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.159
as your disciple,

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.480
I would of course be willing
to share them with my master.

00:35:21.559 --> 00:35:22.280
Very well.

00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:24.310
What sort of charts are they?

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.960
Second Prince, you seem quite concerned
about the Three Judicial Offices.

00:35:29.159 --> 00:35:30.360
Why not talk with me?

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:32.760
Commandery Prince An.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:33.559
Your Highness.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.119
May I ask what charts those are?

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.850
Would it be possible
for me to take a look?

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.030
Since I intend

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.310
to study coroner's techniques
under the Princess Consort,

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.190
it would be better
to wait for her consent first.

00:35:47.679 --> 00:35:49.840
Princess Consort,
I will await your answer.

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:52.519
I shall take my leave.

00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:10.199
Still thinking about those charts?

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.599
I have never seen anything so detailed.

00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:16.000
Every layer of flesh,

00:36:16.159 --> 00:36:17.239
every organ,

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.880
every bone,
even the blood vessels and meridians,

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:21.140
are all marked with absolute clarity.

00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:22.320
There is so much in it

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.000
that I never even knew before.

00:36:24.679 --> 00:36:25.679
It seems You Chen'an

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.880
has shown real sincerity,
just to enter the Three Judicial Offices

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.440
and take you as his teacher.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.280
May I recruit him?

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.480
He is clearly gifted,

00:36:32.559 --> 00:36:33.639
truly eager to learn,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.270
and even understands
examination techniques

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.800
that differ
from those used in Great Tang.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.000
I might even learn something
from him as well.

00:36:40.599 --> 00:36:43.000
At present,
His Majesty keeps him in Chang'an

00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:44.639
under the guise of cultural exchange,

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.490
and it is hard to say this
does not also mean

00:36:46.559 --> 00:36:48.300
using him as leverage
over the Nanzhao King.

00:36:49.199 --> 00:36:50.559
His current position

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:52.199
is extremely delicate.

00:36:54.559 --> 00:36:55.519
I see.

00:36:55.639 --> 00:36:56.880
Then let us leave it for now.

00:36:57.199 --> 00:36:58.760
Matters of the court come first.

00:36:59.079 --> 00:36:59.840
After all,

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.280
training coroners
is never something done overnight.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.719
There will be other chances.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.920
However, if you wish to study
that chart more closely,

00:37:07.719 --> 00:37:09.039
I may be able to find a way.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.360
I do want to see it.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.679
But he seems to treasure it greatly.

00:37:14.239 --> 00:37:15.519
Would he really lend it to me?

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.079
Something so precious,

00:37:18.159 --> 00:37:19.559
since he already let you see it,

00:37:20.199 --> 00:37:21.599
it was no coincidence.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.290
Whether he lends it or not

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.100
(Record of You Chen'an,
Nanzhao Envoy to Tang)

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:26.920
is no longer his decision.

00:37:32.199 --> 00:37:33.000
Vice Minister Jing,

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.480
these are all the recent movements
of Master Shenguan.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.599
A true eminent monk indeed.

00:37:38.159 --> 00:37:40.880
Whether rich or poor,
as long as one asks sincerely,

00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:43.159
he personally conducts the rituals.

00:37:44.039 --> 00:37:45.790
At most, he performs
three ceremonies a day.

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:49.000
Why do you not show
such diligence when on duty?

00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:49.559
I…

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.920
Judging from these movements,

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.119
there truly seems
to be nothing suspicious.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.890
I have followed him for quite some time,

00:37:58.039 --> 00:38:00.559
and he appears
to be a genuine high monk,

00:38:00.639 --> 00:38:02.480
thinking only of delivering all beings.

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:03.790
There seems to be no major issue.

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:06.639
Could it be that we
have been wasting our effort?

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.480
This still requires
the Prince's judgment.

00:38:09.719 --> 00:38:12.230
He would not have us
surveil and investigate without a reason.

00:38:13.159 --> 00:38:14.400
No matter the outcome,

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.960
there must be intent behind it.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:19.770
Vice Minister Jing.

00:38:21.119 --> 00:38:21.860
There is movement.

00:38:22.039 --> 00:38:24.320
Just now, Master Shenguan
changed into plain clothes

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.639
and left Weiguo Temple alone.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.380
Come in.

00:38:49.039 --> 00:38:50.400
Where is he going?

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.719
Do none of you spare
even a little concern for me?

00:39:14.159 --> 00:39:15.159
Concern about what?

00:39:16.159 --> 00:39:17.679
I did not sleep at all last night,

00:39:17.719 --> 00:39:19.840
working alone on cases
at the Three Judicial Offices.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.480
Count yourself lucky.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.599
These past two days,
to protect You Chen'an,

00:39:27.639 --> 00:39:29.199
I have been sleeping on rooftops.

00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:33.480
My dear has worked hard.

00:39:33.719 --> 00:39:34.679
My dear is formidable.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.880
So what did you find?

00:39:36.519 --> 00:39:38.079
More than just finding something.

00:39:38.199 --> 00:39:39.960
I uncovered something major.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.440
That Master Shenguan
the Prince had me watch,

00:39:43.519 --> 00:39:44.760
when he was young,

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.800
was actually a monk of Great Tang.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.320
A Tang native?

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.639
It is said that back then

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.890
he had no reputation at all,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.519
just a wandering monk,

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.000
traveling and practicing austerities.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.880
For reasons unknown, he went to Nanzhao,

00:39:58.039 --> 00:39:58.890
and when he returned,

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.559
he had become
a revered holy monk admired by all.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.239
However,

00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:06.400
just a few nights ago,

00:40:06.599 --> 00:40:09.320
Master Shenguan went to
the Bureau of Entertainment in plain clothes.

00:40:10.239 --> 00:40:12.400
And he clearly was not there
for the first time,

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:13.980
he seemed very familiar with the place.

00:40:16.599 --> 00:40:17.960
If this were to be discovered

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.719
by those in the capital who idolize him,

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.320
it would cause an uproar.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.000
At present, devotion to the holy monk
is sweeping the capital.

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:27.640
If such influence were exploited,

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:29.090
the consequences would be unimaginable.

00:40:29.719 --> 00:40:30.800
Hold on to this lead.

00:40:31.159 --> 00:40:32.559
Following it through step by step,

00:40:32.719 --> 00:40:34.519
we may yet uncover clues
about the Peacock.

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:42.159
He.

00:40:43.159 --> 00:40:44.079
You're here, Chu.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.140
I brought you some food, clothes,
and daily necessities from the manor.

00:40:46.159 --> 00:40:46.870
Where should I put them?

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.559
Anywhere is fine.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.400
Go eat first.

00:40:51.159 --> 00:40:52.440
You even brought cured ham.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:53.250
Let me have a piece.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:04.679
Chu.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.119
Chu.

00:41:09.199 --> 00:41:10.599
About what I mentioned earlier,

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.100
about An wanting to enter
the Three Judicial Offices...

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:12.920
He.

00:41:13.159 --> 00:41:13.800
Not now.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:14.760
Eat first.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.590
Matters of the Three Judicial Offices
are for the Prince to decide.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:19.920
Then what will you do?

00:41:20.599 --> 00:41:21.639
Commandery Prince An and I

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.310
have an appointment
at Guangtai Tower tonight.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.199
When the time comes,

00:41:24.639 --> 00:41:26.000
I will discuss it with him again.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:31.100
I am deeply grateful to Your Highness
for repeatedly standing up for me.

00:41:31.119 --> 00:41:32.950
I originally planned to invite you
for a drink first,

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.000
but someone beat me to it.

00:41:34.639 --> 00:41:36.320
So tonight I borrow the occasion

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.639
to toast you.

00:41:38.039 --> 00:41:38.880
First, to thank you for saving me.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.790
Second, to celebrate meeting
a good friend, far from home.

00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:44.079
It was my duty.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.159
You need not dwell on it.

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:47.159
But as for friendship
with the Second Prince,

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:48.559
it is something I truly welcome.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.990
Coming to the capital,
I gained two great fortunes.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:53.880
The first

00:41:54.679 --> 00:41:55.920
was being reunited with He.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.000
The second was meeting Your Highness.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.990
Hearing you say this,
truly makes me glad.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.400
I heard
the Second Prince possesses a chart

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.159
that is remarkably detailed and precise.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:07.199
May I borrow it for a look?

00:42:09.079 --> 00:42:09.880
So it turns out

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.100
this drink is being offered
on the Princess Consort's behalf.

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:16.870
I had long heard that Your Highness
and Princess Consort are deeply devoted.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.100
It seems the rumors were true.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.320
But to be frank,

00:42:20.719 --> 00:42:21.920
the chart is far too precious.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.490
Please forgive me for not lending it out.

00:42:26.079 --> 00:42:27.519
If it is truly so valuable,

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.239
why did you offer it of your own accord

00:42:30.119 --> 00:42:32.519
as a condition for entering
the Three Judicial Offices?
