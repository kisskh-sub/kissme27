00:00:20.168 --> 00:00:21.228
(Tan Group.)

00:00:21.447 --> 00:00:24.347
(Eight years ago,
you brought my family to ruin.)

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:26.468
(Are you ready to settle the score?)

00:00:36.448 --> 00:00:37.507
Father.

00:00:39.168 --> 00:00:41.068
(From this moment on,)

00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:42.961
(everything here)

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:44.907
(belongs to the Tan Group.)

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.227
From today onward,

00:00:49.688 --> 00:00:51.867
you are nothing more than an outcast.

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:54.148
An outcast,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.589
left to survive on scraps.

00:00:58.607 --> 00:00:59.988
Mr. Tan.

00:01:00.647 --> 00:01:02.148
It is time to collect the interest.

00:01:16.912 --> 00:01:18.619
=Secret By My Name=

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.211
(Adapted from the novel
Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

00:01:21.212 --> 00:01:22.166
=Episode 1=

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:24.806
This suit is our department's
latest design.

00:01:24.807 --> 00:01:27.206
It uses the most popular
striped elements of the moment.

00:01:27.207 --> 00:01:29.307
A design this drawn out,

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:32.227
are you trying to make
the Tan Group a laughingstock?

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:36.420
Do not try to brush me off
with this kind of work again.

00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:46.548
Or you can leave the Tan Group.

00:01:46.968 --> 00:01:47.708
Do you understand?

00:01:48.768 --> 00:01:49.566
Speak.

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:50.366
Did you understand?

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:51.708
I understand.

00:01:54.768 --> 00:01:55.446
Fei.

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:56.268
Fei.

00:01:57.688 --> 00:01:58.908
Do not be anxious.

00:01:59.287 --> 00:02:00.726
Design work like this

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:02.286
needs time to be refined.

00:02:02.287 --> 00:02:03.327
You know that.

00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:05.867
Change the peak lapel
to a lightweight double breasted lapel.

00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:07.867
Raise the waistline by two centimeters.

00:02:25.248 --> 00:02:27.668
Replace the gold plated buttons
with obsidian buttons.

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:44.228
As for this moldy lining,

00:02:49.487 --> 00:02:53.828
if President Wang tries it on himself,
it would actually suit him quite well.

00:02:53.848 --> 00:02:55.708
So it was you.

00:02:56.088 --> 00:02:57.886
Miss Li, eight years ago,

00:02:57.887 --> 00:03:00.307
you were driven out in disgrace.

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:02.446
And now you still have the nerve

00:03:02.447 --> 00:03:04.067
to come back and show your face.

00:03:04.887 --> 00:03:07.027
Mr. Wang, your memory seems rather poor.

00:03:11.928 --> 00:03:13.166
When you were overseas last week

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:15.527
and lost two rosewood production lines,

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.606
the way you knelt
and begged your creditors for mercy

00:03:17.607 --> 00:03:19.508
was far more sincere
than anything you show now.

00:03:20.327 --> 00:03:23.148
You swore you would
repay everything within one month.

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:24.087
Make a sound like a dog,

00:03:24.088 --> 00:03:25.828
and I will let you leave today.

00:03:26.808 --> 00:03:27.747
Woof.

00:03:29.248 --> 00:03:30.347
Woof, woof.

00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:32.708
You... Give that back to me.

00:03:50.887 --> 00:03:53.967
Mr. Wang is now perfectly suited
to endorse Tan Group's new product line.

00:03:53.968 --> 00:03:56.548
After all,
the theme of predatory capital

00:03:56.808 --> 00:03:59.027
is something you portray effortlessly.

00:04:00.047 --> 00:04:00.967
Security.

00:04:00.968 --> 00:04:02.067
Someone come here.

00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:02.967
Security.

00:04:02.968 --> 00:04:05.307
Get this woman out of here.

00:04:08.368 --> 00:04:09.587
Get out.

00:04:20.808 --> 00:04:22.027
You should never have come back.

00:04:23.127 --> 00:04:25.268
I came back this time
to take a few things.

00:04:25.768 --> 00:04:27.027
Your power.

00:04:27.807 --> 00:04:28.907
His life.

00:04:29.848 --> 00:04:30.948
And also,

00:04:34.528 --> 00:04:36.667
the thing you hold every night
when you sleep.

00:04:39.008 --> 00:04:40.708
My old school uniform.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.900
(Tan Group)

00:04:49.888 --> 00:04:52.880
I am very pleased to work with all of you
to create a brilliant future together.

00:04:53.047 --> 00:04:54.227
I appreciate your support.

00:04:58.212 --> 00:04:59.072
Li Shujing.

00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:01.805
You went to great lengths
to stage all of this.

00:05:03.448 --> 00:05:04.628
Did you really think

00:05:05.848 --> 00:05:07.427
this would get you into the Tan Group?

00:05:13.968 --> 00:05:18.227
Li Shujing's consulting agreement

00:05:20.607 --> 00:05:21.948
was signed

00:05:22.848 --> 00:05:24.007
by me personally.

00:05:24.008 --> 00:05:26.547
Mr. Tan disappeared for two years,
and has finally reappeared.

00:05:31.408 --> 00:05:33.388
An agreement signed by the dead

00:05:33.807 --> 00:05:35.427
is overruled by rules set by the living.

00:05:36.848 --> 00:05:38.427
From today onward,

00:05:38.528 --> 00:05:41.587
every single stitch of
the Autumn Winter Alpine Collection

00:05:42.127 --> 00:05:44.107
will follow my rules.

00:06:11.408 --> 00:06:12.587
We are not going home yet.

00:06:13.568 --> 00:06:14.787
We are going somewhere else.

00:06:37.088 --> 00:06:38.347
Eight years.

00:06:39.487 --> 00:06:41.547
And all you learned was
how to burn discarded drafts.

00:06:43.367 --> 00:06:45.308
When you bit through
my collarbone back then,

00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:47.828
you were far more ruthless
than you are now.

00:06:49.927 --> 00:06:52.347
I am designing funeral invitations
for the Tan Group.

00:06:53.208 --> 00:06:54.467
The main image

00:06:55.088 --> 00:06:57.547
should be the bite mark
on your collarbone. What do you think?

00:06:58.047 --> 00:06:59.667
After all, this is the Tan Group's

00:06:59.968 --> 00:07:01.748
only thing that was ever real.

00:07:04.687 --> 00:07:06.246
Instead of burning these useless drafts,

00:07:06.247 --> 00:07:07.667
you might as well burn me.

00:07:08.167 --> 00:07:10.347
That was your plan
eight years ago anyway.

00:07:10.367 --> 00:07:12.547
Back then, you were a truant teenager.

00:07:13.648 --> 00:07:16.188
Now, you are the president
of the Tan Group.

00:07:17.127 --> 00:07:19.027
It does make me feel

00:07:19.807 --> 00:07:21.188
more accomplished than before.

00:07:26.448 --> 00:07:28.347
Then this time,
remember to change the knot.

00:07:28.687 --> 00:07:30.667
The bow you tied back then

00:07:31.008 --> 00:07:32.547
was far too easy to break free from.

00:08:03.127 --> 00:08:04.068
Li Shujing.

00:08:04.687 --> 00:08:07.447
Every sheet of paper you burn here
proves that you still cannot forget

00:08:07.448 --> 00:08:08.567
the fool who willingly let you

00:08:08.568 --> 00:08:09.868
tie him up back then.

00:08:10.328 --> 00:08:11.427
But let me make this clear.

00:08:12.888 --> 00:08:14.308
The Tan Group today

00:08:14.768 --> 00:08:17.068
has no room
for two living corpses in its coffin.

00:08:17.607 --> 00:08:19.606
You do not seriously think
that in these eight years

00:08:19.607 --> 00:08:21.628
all I learned was how to mourn, do you?

00:08:24.807 --> 00:08:26.107
Look closely.

00:08:26.367 --> 00:08:28.868
I carved my own tombstone long ago

00:08:29.088 --> 00:08:30.907
into climbing pitons.

00:08:31.127 --> 00:08:32.508
So tell me,

00:08:32.648 --> 00:08:35.188
from which floor of the Tan Group

00:08:35.927 --> 00:08:37.647
will the sound of bones and lies

00:08:37.648 --> 00:08:39.468
shattering together
be loud enough to hear?

00:08:42.808 --> 00:08:44.547
Then take your pitons

00:08:44.688 --> 00:08:45.988
and move into the top floor.

00:08:46.288 --> 00:08:48.388
After all, the teeth that once
bit through my collarbone

00:08:48.808 --> 00:08:51.667
were never meant to belong
to a well behaved girl.
