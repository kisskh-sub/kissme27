=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.900
(This story is entirely fictional.)

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:45.519
(My name is Chu Chu.)

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.290
(I admired Handsome Judge
since I was young.)

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.359
(I vowed to become
an excellent coroner,)

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.319
(so I went alone to Chang'an)

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.330
(to take the Three Judicial Offices'
coroner exam.)

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.159
(But I mistook His Highness for a test)

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.480
(and nearly stripped him in public.)

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.200
(Fortunately,)

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:02.519
(the prince with godlike judgment)

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.959
(gave me a chance to prove myself.)

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.359
(I gave it my all)

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.319
(and used my unique coroner skills)

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.120
(to stay in the Three Judicial Offices.)

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.560
(From then on, every day began)

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.520
(with the joy of examining bodies.)

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.759
(There,)

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.520
(I met new close friends.)

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.039
(Vice Minister Jing,)

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.319
(clever, sharp,)

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.759
(and skilled at reading people and lies.)

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.479
(Miss Leng,)

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.080
(highly skilled in martial arts)

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.360
(and deeply righteous.)

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.759
(She was injured protecting me,)

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.639
(yet she comforted me instead.)

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:34.159
(I used my coroner skills)

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.520
(to recreate scenes with His Highness.)

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.319
(Together, we solved a major case
threatening the throne.)

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:42.039
(I was thus commended by His Majesty)

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.599
(and granted the title
Imperial Coroner.)

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.680
(His Highness and I
fell in love amid danger.)

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.599
(We're husband and wife)

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.840
(and also partners in battle.)

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.199
(Life after marriage)

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:05.240
(is sweet and fulfilling.)

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.000
(In a blink,)

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.879
(three years passed.)

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.100
=Episode 1=

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.479
(Late mid-Tang dynasty,)

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.479
(Emperor Xuanzong governed tirelessly.)

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.639
(He established Three Judicial Offices)

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.960
(and appointed
Commandery Prince An Xiao Jinyu)

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.360
(to oversee all criminal justice,)

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.080
(punish evil,)

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.599
(redress injustices,)

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.280
(and uphold order.)

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.120
(Yet villains still stirred.)

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.639
(And neighboring nations
watched with predatory eyes.)

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.879
(On the Emperor's birthday,)

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.039
(all realms)

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.719
(sent envoys to the court.)

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.620
It's already this month.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.580
Why is it still so cold?

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.719
Here.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.439
Have some liquor.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.360
It'll warm you up.

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.599
It's quiet tonight.

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.719
Tomorrow is the Emperor's birthday.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.719
The curfew is lifted.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.039
That's when we'll be busy.

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.360
With pay that little,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.680
let's just patrol casually.

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:18.360
All is perfectly peaceful
under the Emperor's nose.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.480
What was that?

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.560
Stay alert.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.580
Envoys arrive
for the birthday banquet tomorrow.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.000
No mistakes are allowed.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.879
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.480
If any of you

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.600
mess this up at this moment,

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.639
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

00:04:58.639 --> 00:04:59.279
He's here.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.439
He's here again.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.240
Why are you so clumsy?

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:02.959
What's here?

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:04.279
A ghost.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.480
It's haunted.

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:06.519
A ghost?

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.279
There are endless ghost tales
in the palace.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.240
Who has seen a real one?

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.000
Get back to work.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.260
(Three Judicial Offices)

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.660
(Chu Chu, Imperial Coroner,
Commandery Princess Consort An)

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.000
Your Highness, look.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.720
(Xiao Jinyu, Commandery Prince An)

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.319
What is it?

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.319
The fontanelle sits too low.

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:16.920
The frontal bone protrudes.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.790
The temporal bones flare outward.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.240
Between the parietal
and occipital bones lacks fullness.

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:24.519
Is something wrong?

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.279
If the hair is styled like this,
my skull looks poorly matched to yours.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.560
Skull?

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.759
Matched to me?

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.800
Eyes can deceive.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.639
Once the hair is done,

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.399
it can make a person's whole skull

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.600
look better than it truly is.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.000
Your skull is naturally excellent.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.759
I must style my hair properly

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.120
to look better matched to you.

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:52.759
Let me have a look.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.839
How could
Commandery Princess Consort An lie?

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.000
We're clearly a perfect match.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.199
The birthday banquet is just a meal.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:09.720
No need to be so nervous.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.720
Rest assured.

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:13.519
I've learned the palace rules.

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:15.000
I won't embarrass us

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.079
nor Three Judicial Offices.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.970
You're busy daily
at the Three Judicial Offices.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.199
Where did you find time to hire a tutor?

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:23.959
Not a tutor.

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:25.399
It was Leng Yue.

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:26.600
Leng Yue?

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:33.639
These rules are not absolutely necessary.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.900
After being married so long,

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.279
this is my first formal palace banquet.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.000
I'm Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:40.439
I can't embarrass ourselves.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.920
I'm the one troubling you
to spare time to go with me.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.839
You willing to go

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.879
already makes me very grateful.

00:07:59.199 --> 00:07:59.800
Chu Chu.

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:01.439
Chu Chu.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:03.920
(Leng Yue, Daughter
of Qianzhongdao's Leng family)

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.519
Chu Chu.

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:07.639
I brought you
clothes and grooming items.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.720
When will you learn
to knock before entering?

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:12.759
And you teach others etiquette?

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.580
Sorry to disturb you both.

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:16.560
Leng Yue.

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:18.439
Why did you deliver these yourself?

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.399
Where is Wu Jiang?

00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:23.199
It seems our carriage
is stuck at the West Market.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.480
She happened to run into it.

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:25.439
How do you know?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.880
The petal shaped paper scraps
in your hair bun

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.439
were thrown during the shop opening.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.480
Move aside.

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:31.319
Move aside.

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:37.879
The gold dust on your clothes and bag

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.730
comes from the scarves hung outside

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.639
West Market tailor shops year round.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.159
The moss on your hem and shoes

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.279
shows you took a shortcut.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.639
A shortcut that draws all eyes.

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:56.159
- Good.
- Good.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.350
People of Commandery Prince An's Mansion

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.250
really lack experience
with joining in the fun.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.720
Today is the Emperor's birthday.

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:02.799
The city is packed.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.190
Yet Wu Jiang still drove a carriage
to deliver things.

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:09.480
Are you

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.320
doing your hair here?

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.279
I have too much work to return home.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:14.919
It happens

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.240
the tools used for preparing bodies
are all here,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.840
so I asked His Highness for help.

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:21.559
Since you're here,

00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:22.840
I'll go prepare as well.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.279
See you soon.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.160
(Jing Yi, Vice Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review)

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.480
(Xiao Jinli, Marquis Duyu)

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.600
Commandery Prince An's reach is too far.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.279
His Three Judicial Offices

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.279
now manage all major and minor cases
in Chang'an.

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:10.000
(Jiang Daohai, Prefect of the Capital)
Capital security.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.720
(Liu Shijiang, Prefect of Jiaozhou)
Reassignment of offending officials.

00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:12.399
Even

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:13.639
envoys from afar

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:15.360
(Huang Lv, Vice Minister of Rites)
must follow his rules.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.039
He wouldn't even spare

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.879
a bit of allowance
for us censors from various prefectures.

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:21.440
Allowance?

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.440
Sirs.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.480
We officials in the capital

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.759
are lucky just to have our pay.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840
Prefect of the Capital.

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:30.960
Speak freely.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.120
Speak freely.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.480
Everyone has their own agenda,

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:39.519
except they unite against Jinyu.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.240
(Zhao Zhaoning, Consort Hui)

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.240
If we say

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:45.039
(Zhao Wanrong, Wife of Prefect of the Capital)
the model among the capital's women,

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:47.989
(Jiang Yufen)
Commandery Princess Consort An

00:10:47.989 --> 00:10:49.440
(Wife of Vice Minister Zhao of Ministry of Rites)
would definitely have a place.

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:52.279
I heard from the previous
Prefect of Qianzhou's wife

00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:53.840
(Shi Qing, Consort Hui's Chief Maid)
that Commandery Prince An

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.039
even personally
made a set o autopsy tools

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.500
for Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:10:57.919 --> 00:10:59.559
What a sinister token of love.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.240
Commandery Princess Consort An
is extraordinary.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.720
She spends her days
in coroner's clothes,

00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:06.399
digging among corpses.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.720
That coroner outfit
is my official uniform.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.399
Look, His Highness and Jing Yi

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.480
can wear uniforms at palace banquets.

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:13.519
I can't.

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:14.440
Clothes

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:17.120
are just for decorating fools.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.480
You're Tang Dynasty's
first imperial coroner.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.759
You're granted personally
by His Majesty. That's rare.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.320
I believe

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:25.720
that one day

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.000
you'll wear this coroner outfit
in the palace.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.159
You're right.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.039
At today's banquet, I'll show them

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:35.080
a coroner princess consort
is no worse than any lady.

00:11:38.919 --> 00:11:40.919
Commandery Prince An has arrived.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.480
- Commandery Prince An.
- Commandery Prince An.

00:11:52.559 --> 00:11:53.799
- Commandery Prince An.
- Commandery Prince An.

00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:54.880
Commandery Prince An.

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:00.399
- Commandery Prince An.
- Commandery Prince An.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.440
Our Xinluo tea is famous far and wide.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:03.879
When you're free,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.840
please try some.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:05.680
Commandery Prince An,

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.880
our envoy has been taken
by the Three Judicial Offices

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.000
for over a month.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.279
Why not let him

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.639
invite you elsewhere for tea?

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.590
Commandery Prince An.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.799
My suburban house
has clear mountains and waters

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.700
and beautiful scenery.

00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:16.720
Take a look.

00:12:16.879 --> 00:12:18.279
Flowers bloom in splendor.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.159
Cooking fires flare.

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:33.559
Ladies and ministers sit separately.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.720
Noble ladies are in the inner section.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.380
(Commandery Princess Consort An
has arrived.)

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:38.000
Currently,

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:40.720
Consort Hui manages the six palaces.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.879
The ladies all honor her.

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:43.960
Exactly.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:45.660
By the way,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.399
if she asks about your work
at the Three Judicial Offices...

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.919
Don't reveal everything truthfully.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.399
We show our faces daily,

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.799
but the palace forbids private contact
between men and women.

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:58.399
Maids and guards are punished
for minor interactions.

00:12:59.919 --> 00:13:01.840
Tang law has no such rule.

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:03.399
Law is law.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.799
Palace rules are palace rules.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.360
Let's not argue with them.

00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:08.919
Congratulations.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.720
Like Commandery Prince An,

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.879
you'll become
a thorn in everyone's eyes.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.799
Your tea leaves

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.279
far exceed reported amounts.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.490
You're suspected of private sale.

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:18.440
Your envoy

00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:20.799
visited 18 of our officials in a month,

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.519
gifting over 10,000 taels of silver.

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:23.600
You

00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:25.919
occupy suburban fields
to build a private mansions.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.900
Three Judicial Offices seized them
in accordance with the law.

00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:28.879
Tea is unnecessary.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.639
Handle official business first.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.159
We're all foreign envoys.

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:36.200
Seeking friendship with you

00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:37.759
is a matter of diplomacy.

00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:40.320
But your actions

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.519
show disregard for us.

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:47.639
Tang law

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:49.039
applies to all.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.120
Coincidentally, Three Judicial Offices,
have official matters needing your help.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.799
I fear

00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:58.600
(Gao Luoqian, Vice Envoy of Nanzhao)
I can't help you.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.200
According to Three Judicial Offices'
investigation, recent years,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.600
many border villagers
were lured with high wages

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.720
and tricked
into illegally crossing to Nanzhao.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.480
Three Judicial Offices have investigated
but many remain missing.

00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:12.240
We hope Nanzhao will assist
as much as possible

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:15.159
to apprehend the wanted criminals
and return Tang's missing citizens,

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.639
so they can come home soon.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.620
We want to see them,
whether they're alive or dead.

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:19.879
Then the case may be closed.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.039
And justice
will be restored to the victims.

00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:27.200
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.320
Please rise.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.440
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:14:39.399 --> 00:14:40.120
Be careful.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.519
Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.279
How can you
bring a weapon into the palace?

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:46.519
This isn't a weapon.

00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:48.320
These are tools for my autopsies.

00:14:53.919 --> 00:14:55.120
Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:57.440
Today is His Majesty's birthday banquet.

00:14:57.679 --> 00:14:59.480
How could you bring such unlucky items?

00:14:59.679 --> 00:15:00.320
Fortunately,

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.279
none of the ladies here are pregnant.

00:15:02.559 --> 00:15:03.240
Otherwise,

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.240
it would be bad luck.

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:05.639
Mrs. Zhao, rest assured.

00:15:06.279 --> 00:15:07.480
After each autopsy,

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:09.000
I clean the tools thoroughly.

00:15:09.399 --> 00:15:11.879
Dissected bodies
are carefully sewn back.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.320
We respect the dead,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.120
speaking for what they cannot,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.559
so there's no bad luck.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:17.919
Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.879
Say less.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.120
Take your seats.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.990
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.399
Also, regarding the cases

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:29.200
related to each of you,

00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:32.039
Three Judicial Offices
have sorted the details

00:15:32.159 --> 00:15:33.799
and sent them to your lodging inns.

00:15:34.159 --> 00:15:35.679
I hope you cooperate fully.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.480
Don't let a single criminal

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:39.440
escape justice.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.320
Commandery Prince An.

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:49.080
His Majesty has arrived.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.740
(Jinbao, Chief Eunuch)

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:05.590
- We respectfully welcome Your Majesty.
- We respectfully welcome Your Majesty.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.120
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

00:16:09.799 --> 00:16:10.879
Honored ministers.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.600
Rise.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.690
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.639
Jinbao.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.879
Begin.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.320
Did you all hear that?

00:16:54.919 --> 00:16:56.039
- Long live.
- Long live.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.500
- Long live.
- Long live.

00:16:57.519 --> 00:16:58.320
General Xiao.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.200
Please.

00:16:59.879 --> 00:17:00.480
Please.

00:17:02.679 --> 00:17:04.759
I arranged today's banquet.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:06.359
Try

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.920
and see if it suits your taste.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.880
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

00:17:16.279 --> 00:17:17.319
I'm good with this.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.960
I feel like

00:17:35.319 --> 00:17:36.160
she's

00:17:36.559 --> 00:17:37.799
treating the roasted meat

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.519
as a corpse.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.920
Protect the Emperor!

00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:05.200
Protect the Emperor!

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.480
The skull is moving.

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:44.960
Ghost!

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.319
- Ghost!
- Ghost!

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.700
- There's a ghost!
- There's a ghost!

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:53.359
What happened?

00:18:55.279 --> 00:18:56.039
Don't panic.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.039
This is just a dead person's skull.

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:01.279
Don't panic.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.400
Some animal
must have entered this cavity.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.519
How do you know?

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.160
Chu Chu mentioned it before.

00:19:09.079 --> 00:19:10.200
There's a toad inside.

00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:11.480
People or animals

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.480
sometimes fall in ponds.

00:19:13.559 --> 00:19:15.839
It must have entered while still small

00:19:16.039 --> 00:19:18.000
to feed on the brain of the deceased.

00:19:18.279 --> 00:19:19.079
Later it grew

00:19:19.119 --> 00:19:19.960
and couldn't get out.

00:19:20.039 --> 00:19:21.400
Cases where animals carry bones

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.160
do occur sometimes.

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:28.279
You mean there are human bones

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:29.480
in this lotus pond?

00:19:31.359 --> 00:19:33.799
The part connecting the skull
to the neck

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.759
is much cleaner than the rest,

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:38.000
indicating it was recently detached
from the neck.

00:19:38.359 --> 00:19:40.720
The rest of the body
is likely still in the pond.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.480
How could such unlucky things
exist in the palace?

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.200
Quickly summon the palace official.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.039
The royal palace
is always heavily guarded.

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:55.519
How could there be a corpse

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.440
in this pond?

00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:58.240
Chu Chu.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.759
Did you discover anything?

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:00.640
Yes.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.680
(Skull Maturity)
The deceased's skull is mature.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:03.920
The forehead is flat.

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:05.799
Occipital and brow bones protrude.

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:07.200
Mandible angle is wide.

00:20:07.279 --> 00:20:08.319
Zygomatic arch is strong.

00:20:08.519 --> 00:20:09.799
It should be an adult male.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.920
(Teeth Wear)
Judging from the teeth,

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.090
he was about 30 years old.

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:14.480
Orbital edges are rounded,

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:15.759
and nose is sunken.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.920
These are features
of a Central Plains person.

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:23.640
During decomposition,
the body was covered in algae.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.880
It must have been soaking there
for at least half a year.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.060
- Half a year?
- Half a year?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.920
Your Highness, forgive me.
I arrived late.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.800
We'll take the remains away immediately
and investigate thoroughly.

00:20:44.079 --> 00:20:45.000
Just put it in here.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.100
Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.480
I know you're the coroner
of the Three Judicial Offices,

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.200
but this matter
happened inside the palace

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.990
and should be handled
by the palace official.

00:20:58.039 --> 00:20:59.839
Do you know who the deceased is?

00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:04.119
How would I know?

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.880
The palace guards are strict,

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.359
and all entries are logged in detail.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.519
The deceased is very likely someone
from the palace.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.270
You oversee the six palaces, Your Highness.

00:21:12.319 --> 00:21:14.119
If someone
had been missing for this long,

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.920
it should have been
reported to you already.

00:21:16.119 --> 00:21:16.640
Impudent.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.370
Are you interrogating Her Highness?

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.119
Moreover,

00:21:20.519 --> 00:21:21.839
if he died unnaturally,

00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:24.559
the culprit could very well
be someone in the palace.

00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:26.920
Commandery Princess Consort An,
don't scare us.

00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:29.559
Today, many foreign envoys
are here for the banquet.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.480
You insist on making this unlucky matter

00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:32.680
widely known.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.000
What are your intentions?

00:21:34.599 --> 00:21:35.160
Jinbao.

00:21:35.839 --> 00:21:38.480
Arrange for the ministers
to go to Ziyun House for the banquet.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.519
Yes.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.820
Why are you standing there?

00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:46.400
Go

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.400
and remove the filth.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.990
If you disturb His Majesty,
you will pay with your heads.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.079
How dare you?

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.990
Dare you offend
Commandery Princess Consort An?

00:21:56.119 --> 00:21:58.240
Leave her to me then.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.519
Miss Shi Qing.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:14.759
Enough.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.359
Commandery Prince An.

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:24.519
Vice Minister Jing.

00:22:25.119 --> 00:22:26.200
Come with me to take a look.

00:22:26.319 --> 00:22:26.880
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.480
How dare you
be so reckless in the palace,

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:36.200
disobeying superiors
and spreading rumors?

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.450
If not punished severely,
how can palace rules be upheld?

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.279
Your Highness.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.319
Commandery Princess Consort An acted
for your safety and His Majesty's.

00:22:42.359 --> 00:22:44.640
His Majesty has arrived.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.290
- We respectfully welcome Your Majesty.
- We respectfully welcome Your Majesty.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:50.039
No need for ceremony.

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:51.520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.480
What happened?

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:56.920
Reporting to Your Majesty.

00:22:57.119 --> 00:22:58.039
A palace staff

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.200
was found drowned in the pond.

00:23:00.519 --> 00:23:01.720
I'm handling it.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.119
Is it the head

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.860
Commandery Princess Consort An
is holding?

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.480
Yes.

00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:10.480
Consort Hui is truly perceptive,

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:11.700
and godlike in solving cases.

00:23:12.079 --> 00:23:14.480
Just by looking
at the skull in someone else's hands,

00:23:14.839 --> 00:23:17.880
she could determine the deceased
was a palace staff who fell and drowned.

00:23:19.599 --> 00:23:20.240
Leng Yue.

00:23:21.119 --> 00:23:21.880
You explain.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.370
Reporting to Your Majesty.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.400
Just now, this skull

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.920
suddenly jumped from the pond

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.020
and was restrained
by Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.120
Her Highness wanted
the palace official to handle it,

00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:34.839
but Commandery Princess Consort An
feared the cause of death was unclear

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.279
and that the culprit
might still be hiding in the palace.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:38.680
Therefore,

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.799
a dispute occurred.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:42.680
Your Majesty.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.559
I didn't mean to offend Consort Hui.

00:23:46.359 --> 00:23:46.920
It's just that

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.440
the rest of the deceased's remains
should still be in the pond

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.079
and the cause of death is still unknown.

00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:53.519
As the only coroner
in the Imperial Garden,

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.119
I must prioritize the deceased.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.720
You're

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.119
truly a coroner favored by His Majesty.

00:23:59.319 --> 00:24:01.240
You're always
performing your duties diligently.

00:24:01.319 --> 00:24:02.519
It's truly admirable.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.720
But matters inside the palace

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.890
don't fall under the jurisdiction
of Three Judicial Offices.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.990
The palace has its own rules.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.680
This matter

00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:10.920
is better handled
by the palace official.

00:24:14.079 --> 00:24:15.480
You're right.

00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:17.480
However,

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:18.610
Your Majesty,

00:24:19.839 --> 00:24:22.640
today's banquet is filled
with officials and foreign envoys.

00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:23.890
If another coroner is chosen

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.990
and the palace official
brought in a group to investigate,

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.920
it may risk escalating the situation.

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:31.799
Better to handle it on the spot.

00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:33.480
Let me and His Highness handle it.

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:35.990
If Your Majesty permits,

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.880
I'm willing to lead everyone present

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.240
to conduct a swift investigation.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.359
If this matter

00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:41.799
truly involves foul play,

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.660
we'll leave the final judgment
to Your Majesty.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.680
Consort Hui also said earlier

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.680
that Your Majesty highly favors

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.720
Chu Chu's coroner skills.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.000
Your Highness always aligns

00:24:50.079 --> 00:24:50.920
with His Majesty.

00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:52.480
I'm sure

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.160
Your Highness values Chu Chu as well.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.400
Naturally.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.519
As Commandery Prince An suggests,

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.880
investigate swiftly
and report back to me.

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:00.559
Yes.

00:25:01.599 --> 00:25:02.240
Consort Hui.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.240
Come with me.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.610
- Safe journey, Your Majesty.
- Safe journey, Your Majesty.

00:25:12.359 --> 00:25:13.240
Your Highness, look.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.039
This tooth of the deceased
was decayed in life,

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.079
showing he often had toothaches.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.640
He likely had dietary restrictions.

00:25:19.759 --> 00:25:21.599
Those close to him would know this well.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.240
Check with the guards
and eunuchs tomorrow.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:24.960
Leave it to me.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:26.880
As for the palace maids...

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:28.780
It's easier for me and Leng Yue
to speak with them.

00:25:28.799 --> 00:25:29.880
We'll go together tomorrow.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:30.880
Alright.

00:25:31.519 --> 00:25:32.319
Sorry to trouble you

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.759
to haul up the body tonight.

00:25:34.079 --> 00:25:35.079
Why so polite?

00:25:35.519 --> 00:25:37.519
Staying up to handle work
is our specialty.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.079
Hurry back.

00:25:40.319 --> 00:25:41.000
Hurry.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.680
What's the matter with you today?

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.640
I behaved improperly.

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.480
I beg Your Majesty for punishment.

00:25:53.799 --> 00:25:55.799
You've managed the harem for years.

00:25:56.359 --> 00:25:59.440
You're always composed and generous,
handling matters meticulously.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.519
Why act less tactfully than a young girl

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.720
in such a grand occasion?

00:26:07.839 --> 00:26:08.640
With respect,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.319
it was truly sudden.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.359
Her Highness
really did her best to manage it.

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:15.720
And you, having served
in the palace for years,

00:26:16.319 --> 00:26:17.599
you laid hands on someone

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.799
in public.

00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:19.680
If this spreads,

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.880
what would people think?

00:26:21.519 --> 00:26:22.400
I know my fault.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.480
I lost control in the moment of urgency.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.990
I beg Your Majesty and Her Highness
for punishment.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.500
Your Majesty, calm your anger.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.480
I know Commandery Princess Consort An

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:35.559
isn't like ordinary royal women.

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.390
Her work in the Three Judicial Offices
is by Your Majesty's decree.

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:39.839
Today,

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.279
at the imperial birthday banquet,

00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:43.390
she caused a disruption
disregarding the big picture.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.960
If this spreads,

00:26:45.599 --> 00:26:46.160
then...

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.900
Are you really alright?

00:26:57.759 --> 00:26:58.799
I'm fine.

00:27:00.039 --> 00:27:02.319
Even a few more people
couldn't touch a hair.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.839
If you don't believe me,
I can hit you and you'll see.

00:27:06.839 --> 00:27:07.599
Impressive.

00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:11.279
Don't you think

00:27:11.319 --> 00:27:13.279
Consort Hui is acting strange tonight?

00:27:14.279 --> 00:27:15.079
You think so too?

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:17.680
Tonight,

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.319
the Wife of Prefect of the Capital

00:27:19.359 --> 00:27:20.680
keeps stirring trouble,

00:27:22.119 --> 00:27:23.319
but I keep feeling

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.119
Consort Hui isn't angry at all.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.920
She seems more afraid.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.799
Not afraid of the head,

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.039
but afraid of

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.200
Chu Chu.

00:27:36.359 --> 00:27:37.200
Chu Chu?

00:27:39.559 --> 00:27:41.119
You all are too careless.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.240
Now look, Three Judicial Offices
are involved.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:44.920
What kind of person is Xiao Jinyu?

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.700
Even the King of Hell has to let him
check the Book of Life and Death.

00:27:47.759 --> 00:27:49.440
If he discovers anything...

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.359
It's my negligence.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.580
I truly didn't expect
Three Judicial Offices to overstep

00:27:53.599 --> 00:27:54.680
into the inner palace.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.480
If it comes to

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.319
the day even I can't protect this...

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.759
She'll know what to do.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.300
(Discern the bigger picture
from small hints)

00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:16.000
You've worked hard.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.559
It's so late,

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.100
and you're still studying this skull.

00:28:19.119 --> 00:28:20.119
It's so heavy.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.960
My neck is getting stiff.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.390
I'll take it apart for you.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.359
Here.

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:27.440
Being a princess consort is much harder
than being a coroner.

00:28:30.519 --> 00:28:32.640
It's my fault
for neglecting social ties,

00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:34.400
causing you to be wronged.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.200
I'll explain things to Consort Hui.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.559
Don't worry.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.200
I was careless.

00:28:41.599 --> 00:28:44.039
I've always
tried to be mindful of my status,

00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:45.480
but

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.079
when I see this corpse and case,

00:28:48.519 --> 00:28:49.359
I can't help myself.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.720
And I caused such a mess.

00:28:51.839 --> 00:28:52.640
I'm sorry.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.039
Does your shoulder hurt?

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.550
I'll massage them for you.

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:02.119
Your Highness.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.160
Guess what I was thinking

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.500
while holding this skull?

00:29:06.759 --> 00:29:07.440
What?

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.559
As expected,

00:29:08.759 --> 00:29:10.000
most people's skulls

00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:11.119
aren't as pretty as yours.

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.960
If it wasn't pretty,
you wouldn't have held it so tightly.

00:29:15.839 --> 00:29:17.279
My beautiful skull

00:29:17.319 --> 00:29:18.800
has never been held like this before.

00:29:19.119 --> 00:29:21.559
If someone tried to dispose
of your skull recklessly,

00:29:21.599 --> 00:29:23.000
I wouldn't let go either.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.480
Then my skull thanks you in advance.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.300
(Discern the bigger picture
from small hints)

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:38.440
Ouch.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.559
Bold thief.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.990
You've broken
into the Three Judicial Offices.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.039
I'm not a thief.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.290
I came here openly and honestly.

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:53.160
Girl.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.119
Help.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.079
Girl?

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.240
Chu He?

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:58.920
Who?

00:29:59.319 --> 00:29:59.960
Go.

00:30:01.119 --> 00:30:01.640
He.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.079
Are you alright?

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.319
Why are you here?

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.890
(Chu He, Chu Chu's Brother)
Of course I came to see you.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.340
I only found out you hadn't been back

00:30:08.359 --> 00:30:09.990
to the mansion in a long time
after going there.

00:30:10.119 --> 00:30:11.359
(Wu Jiang)
That's why I came here.

00:30:11.759 --> 00:30:12.519
(Commandery Prince An's Guard)
Mr. Chu.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.720
Be the bigger person.

00:30:14.039 --> 00:30:15.079
I didn't hold back

00:30:15.359 --> 00:30:16.240
just now.

00:30:16.799 --> 00:30:18.200
You know I'm Mr. Chu?

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:19.920
I knew it.

00:30:20.039 --> 00:30:21.690
Three Judicial Offices
is heavily guarded.

00:30:22.079 --> 00:30:24.000
No ordinary petty thief could get in.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.759
Chu Chu sent a letter praising
Commandery Prince An's Mansion.

00:30:28.079 --> 00:30:29.160
I had to see it myself

00:30:29.319 --> 00:30:30.519
whether she was wronged.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:31.559
He.

00:30:31.839 --> 00:30:32.759
Good thing I came.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.870
Why is being a princess consort
even harder than before?

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.230
You're still up at this late hour.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.950
Three Judicial Offices
have been busy recently.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.920
I wasn't considerate.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.119
And there's a case
at today's birthday banquet.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.700
That's why we've been working until now.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.780
I'll make sure she gets more rest
in the future.

00:30:46.039 --> 00:30:47.480
Future?

00:30:47.759 --> 00:30:48.720
Go rest now.

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:51.359
Wu Jiang.

00:30:52.039 --> 00:30:53.240
Take my brother back first.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.759
I'll tidy up for a bit.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.319
I'll be back right after.

00:30:56.519 --> 00:30:57.119
Girl.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:57.880
I'll be back soon.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.440
Mr. Chu.

00:30:58.599 --> 00:30:59.039
This way.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:00.680
I even prepared the bathwater for you.

00:31:12.839 --> 00:31:14.319
My brother has always been like this,

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.640
worrying about whether I'm doing well.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.480
(Lian Qiao, Chu Chu's Personal Maid)

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.240
I'm all grown up now,

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.279
but he still treats me like I'm a child.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.319
He's not worried about you,

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:24.559
he's worried about me.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.160
Worried about you?

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.400
Worried about what?

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.680
He's worried that I'd bully you.

00:31:32.279 --> 00:31:32.839
Your Highness.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.559
Your Highness.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.240
Mr. Chu came.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:38.799
Wow.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:40.480
This...

00:31:40.759 --> 00:31:42.000
This is my home.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.160
From Qianzhou?

00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:43.759
Yes.

00:31:43.839 --> 00:31:44.640
Remember?

00:31:44.839 --> 00:31:46.599
These are all from my home in Qianzhou.

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:51.920
Wow.

00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:54.200
I made this little dog myself.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.130
Does it look like real?

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:57.680
It does.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.640
When I first wanted to be a coroner,

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.759
Yamen wouldn't accept me.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:04.519
They said no woman
had ever been a coroner.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.680
Even my brother
took in other apprentices,

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.640
but wouldn't take me.

00:32:08.079 --> 00:32:08.920
Many of these manuals

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.079
were written for me by Sir Witch Doctor.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.720
I even secretly read
my father and brother's books

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.599
and case files.

00:32:16.359 --> 00:32:18.279
Later I realized they already knew

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.599
but didn't expose me.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:23.880
Come here.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:27.720
Your Highness, you know what?

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.270
Summers in Qianzhou are hot.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.820
My father would have my brother
go to the mountains to cut rattan

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:32.880
and learn to weave mats.

00:32:33.359 --> 00:32:34.839
Every year they made new ones for me.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.160
It's cooling to lie on this.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.000
Want to try?

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.319
Sure.

00:32:42.359 --> 00:32:43.319
It really is cool.

00:32:43.519 --> 00:32:44.759
And this mosquito net.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.880
There were a lot of bugs back home.

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:47.920
My brother said

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.640
a girl shouldn't get scars from bites,

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.359
so he secretly used his wages
to buy this net for me.

00:32:52.759 --> 00:32:54.039
I'd hang it every summer.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.160
He thought it would help.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.200
It's not as good as
my father's mugwort sachet.

00:32:59.599 --> 00:33:00.240
This one.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.120
Your Highness,
do you want to carry one on you?

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.480
Besides mugwort, my father added
lots of medicinal powders inside.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.480
We often go into damp places.

00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:10.880
This repels bugs really well.

00:33:13.319 --> 00:33:14.599
Thank you then.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.519
Chu Chu.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.359
I'm very happy.

00:33:25.839 --> 00:33:26.720
What?

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.240
I'm happy that you never gave up
being a coroner.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.839
Because with you,
the only female coroner,

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.120
Three Judicial Offices
could intervene in this case.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.690
You want to investigate this case too?

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.480
You also think Consort Hui,

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:41.200
the palace official, and that chief maid
are a bit off?

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.119
Exactly.

00:33:43.319 --> 00:33:44.759
Their reactions to the remains

00:33:45.519 --> 00:33:46.279
were unusual.

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:49.039
When people are nervous or lying,

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.119
the skin on their face

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.000
involuntarily stiffens and tightens.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.119
To hide it, they display
inappropriate forced smiles.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.950
Surrounding skin
will be pulled toward the eyes,

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.640
but the eyes

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.160
don't move at all.

00:33:59.799 --> 00:34:01.759
The eyebrows lift and draw together,

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.839
and their gazes avoid the questioner.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.359
Blinking increases noticeably.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.799
Some even

00:34:07.119 --> 00:34:09.400
swallow repeatedly due to a dry throat.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:12.360
Forehead, eye sockets,
and sides of the nose start sweating.

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:15.360
So their reactions
indicate something's wrong.

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:18.559
They don't want us to take the corpse.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.119
Or rather, the secret

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:21.800
behind this corpse involves them.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.400
No wonder you always say

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:24.760
a person's expression

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.599
can betray their thoughts.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.360
When it comes to reading people,

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.920
your husband is one of the best in Tang.

00:34:33.119 --> 00:34:34.000
Really?

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.119
Then in your opinion,

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:37.559
do I usually look fierce?

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.199
Of course not.

00:34:41.039 --> 00:34:42.199
Stiff face,

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:46.400
swallowing,

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:49.280
forced smiles.

00:34:51.039 --> 00:34:52.719
Looks like in your eyes,

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:55.000
I really am as the capital rumors say,

00:34:55.039 --> 00:34:56.000
not very good-tempered.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:56.880
No.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.320
My dear.

00:34:57.559 --> 00:34:58.800
Hear me out.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.000
Expressions can be misleading too.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:01.880
Also,

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:02.559
in my opinion,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
a matriarch should be a little imposing.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.360
It stabilizes the household.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.440
Imposing?

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.280
You've learned to anticipate things now?

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.400
I'm familiar with the process.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.599
Alright.

00:35:25.639 --> 00:35:26.199
Here.

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:38.039
I'll never anticipate again.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.119
Jinli.

00:35:50.159 --> 00:35:50.690
Your Highness.

00:35:50.719 --> 00:35:51.239
Chu Chu.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.950
Congratulations,
you finally achieved your wish

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.310
of wearing coroner robes in the palace.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.220
Thanks to His Highness.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:58.360
We couldn't find the corpse.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.440
I ordered people

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.760
to carefully search

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.170
along where the skull jumped out

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.159
but found nothing.

00:36:04.679 --> 00:36:05.079
Chu Chu.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.400
You said the deceased
had been dead at least half a year.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.079
So that would be last winter.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.719
Last winter was mild.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.400
When water didn't freeze anywhere,

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.320
the corpse
should have floated in a few days.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:19.199
Someone should have found it already.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.400
Maybe it got stuck between rocks

00:36:21.719 --> 00:36:22.719
when it fell

00:36:23.039 --> 00:36:25.239
or someone tied a weight to it.

00:36:26.719 --> 00:36:27.320
It's possible.

00:36:27.559 --> 00:36:29.360
But we only have the skull,

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.559
so we can't tell how he fell.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.280
The skull moved with the toad,

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.119
but even if scattered by fish,

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.920
the rest would spread outward

00:36:49.159 --> 00:36:50.159
from the sinking point.

00:36:51.159 --> 00:36:53.210
It should be around
the imperial garden waterways.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:53.880
Search again.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.199
See if there are other clues.

00:37:00.559 --> 00:37:01.800
Lotus Garden has been preparing

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:03.760
for the Emperor's birthday
these past six months.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.000
If someone fell in,

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.400
someone would notice.

00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:08.400
It must have happened at night.

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:09.079
Yes.

00:37:09.239 --> 00:37:10.320
Even with guards at night,

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.679
they patrol according to schedule.

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:15.800
The shape and position of this rockery

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.239
would cast a large shadow at night.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.800
Guards might overlook it.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:25.490
Enter the water from here and check.

00:37:26.159 --> 00:37:26.440
Yes.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:27.920
You all.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:28.970
Enter the water from here.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.119
Your Highness, come here.

00:37:43.239 --> 00:37:45.039
Why are there pumpkin vines here?

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.039
Pumpkin?

00:37:46.519 --> 00:37:46.840
Yes.

00:37:47.639 --> 00:37:50.039
Pumpkins are sown
in early autumn to thrive.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.519
But

00:37:51.639 --> 00:37:53.119
this spot is shady and dry.

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:55.639
Seeds dropping in winter
could sprout in spring.

00:37:56.039 --> 00:37:57.719
With suitable temperature and rain,

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.039
they'd still grow.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.520
It's just that sunlight is poor,

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:01.690
so it doesn't grow very well.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.360
This spot looks like
it's been rubbed by something.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.159
Jinli.

00:38:11.159 --> 00:38:11.559
