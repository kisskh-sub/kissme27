WEBVTT

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.894
Minwoo, you must be busy these days.
I hardly see you anymore.

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:21.563
Not especially.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.149
Oh please.

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:27.360
That boyfriend I saw outside your office
the other day — he was pretty cute.

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.155
What did you want to talk about?

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.906
Come on~

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.242
Since when can't we talk about stuff like that?

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:36.244
Don't be so stiff.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.209
Seriously?

00:00:46.087 --> 00:00:48.381
You always said you weren't interested in dating.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.469
I didn't think you'd go this far.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.848
Actually…

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.440
I don't see what's so funny.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.734
That's not like you at all, Jung Minwoo!

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:10.737
Seriously…

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.782
'Tae-woong'

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.709
Did you fight again?

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:28.755
I'm breaking up with him.

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:31.466
I don't see a future with him.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.347
We've been together over a year…

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:40.016
and he's never even mentioned marriage.

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:44.062
He just wants to keep dating forever.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.981
Ugh, so annoying.

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:53.446
But I'm ridiculous too, aren't I?

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:57.826
Still hanging on even when it's like this.

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:04.791
Ah…

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:07.043
Maybe I should try this fake boyfriend thing too.

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:09.003
So suddenly?

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:11.339
Think about it.

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.342
If my boyfriend sees me with another guy…

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:16.261
he'll go crazy with jealousy.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.347
Maybe he'll just dump me on his own.

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:20.974
That's so immature.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:24.269
You just don't get it. Love is immature.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:29.440
Emotions are messy and pathetic…

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:33.111
but that's what makes us human.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.239
Give me his number.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.283
What?

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:39.951
Yooha's number.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.744
I want to hire him too.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.079
Are you serious?

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:43.788
Why?

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:45.540
You can and I can't?

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:47.500
What's wrong with you?

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.545
Are you his guardian or something?

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:53.965
Don't worry, I'll treat him nicely.

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.468
"I just wanted to earn some money."

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:16.946
Thanks, Minwoo.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.242
What's that childish furry thing?

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:24.078
Actually, it's kind of cute.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:37.008

(Chapter 8: Earthquake)

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:36.275
Minwoo even bought me this perfume…

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:12.812
Good morning.

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:14.188
Morning…

00:05:19.193 --> 00:05:22.113
Well then, I'll be off now.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:35.418
Ugh…

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.670
Should I not have told her?

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:00.943
Hello.

00:06:03.237 --> 00:06:05.823
Wow, hello!

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.667
Did Minwoo pick that outfit for you?

00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:18.586
How did you know?

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:21.589
I know everything.

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:28.054
I bet he picked the perfume too.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.263
Uh, yeah.

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.274
Actually, I asked Minwoo for your number.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:43.236
I needed someone too — a fake boyfriend, that is.

00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:47.073
I see.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:53.788
You weren't offended when he gave me your number, right?

00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:56.833
I…

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.168
wasn't offended.

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:02.130
I guess Minwoo trusted you, Director.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:04.507
I don't think so.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.177
I think he trusted you more than me.

00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:10.221
He believed in you.

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:16.978
Like I said over the phone…

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:20.940
just pretend to be my boyfriend in front of my ex.

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.278
He should be here in about an hour.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.863
Okay.

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.615
Anything you want to order?

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:31.450
I'm fine with anything.

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:33.995
But your preferences matter too.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:36.747
Even if it's just pretense,

00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:39.250
I hope we have a good time.

00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:42.879
Then I'll have an Americano.

00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:45.840
Americano it is.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.968
Hot or iced?

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.511
Iced, please.

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:51.762
Iced? Got it.

00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:53.264
Okay.

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:54.724
What about you?

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:57.518
- I'll have the same one.
- Alright.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:02.440
Shall we go?

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:07.653
Do you like Americanos?

00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:10.656
Well… I just drink them.

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:12.700
- Because of the calories.
- Right, the calories.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:14.994
Really?

00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:17.121
Minwoo said that?

00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:18.497
He really did.

00:08:19.123 --> 00:08:20.124
No way…

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:22.543
Do you know what his nickname was in college?

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:24.879
Robot. He was called a robot.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:25.963
Oh, really?

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:30.426
Yeah, he can be cold and blunt…

00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:32.136
but once you get to know him…

00:08:32.136 --> 00:08:34.472
he's warmer than he seems.

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:39.727
You two seem close.

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:40.937
Ah…

00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:43.147
Do we really?

00:08:47.443 --> 00:08:50.196
I bet you've dated a lot.

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:53.491
Not really.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.826
I don't have money…

00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:57.870
and I've been too busy saving up.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:01.207
And… my brother is really strict.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.001
You have a brother?

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:07.088
Sounds like he really cares about you.

00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:12.468
Right?

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:17.139
But… I think it's more than just caring.

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:22.478
What does he do?

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:25.147
He runs a cocktail bar.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:28.067
Wow, that sounds cool.

00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:31.445
Tell me where it is. I want to visit sometime.

00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:36.450
Do you know Yeonnam-dong?
There's a famous dim sum place.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.911
It's on the third floor of the building next to it.

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:43.791
There's a rose decoration on the railing — you can't miss it.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:10.693
Anyway, that's what he said at the time…

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:12.278
- He was like…
- Hey! Ha Suyeon.

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:18.576
What are you doing here?

00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:22.038
Can I help you?

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:25.291
Who's this?

00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:28.878
Is this your new boyfriend?

00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:33.924
That's right.

00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:36.302
I'm Suyeon's boyfriend.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.556
That's right.

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:42.016
So just go.

00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:45.019
- Get lost.
- Hey! You can't end things like this!

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:46.020
That's enough.

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.023
I'm sure Suyeon has her reasons for this.

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:51.817
Or maybe…

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:56.155
Maybe you didn't give her enough reason to trust you.

00:10:58.574 --> 00:10:59.658
Move aside.

00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:01.077
- I said stop it.
- Excuse me!

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:02.203
That's enough!

00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:03.537
Ugh, what now?

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.251
Jung Minwoo?

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:11.003
Minwoo?!

00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:14.632
Huh?

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:17.343
Who's this now?

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.136
Your boyfriend's boyfriend?

00:11:19.136 --> 00:11:19.970
Or…

00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:21.222
Ha Suyeon's…

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:23.099
second boyfriend?

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:24.433
Stop…

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:26.811
Or I'll call the police.

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:27.978
Go ahead!!!

00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:32.108
Call them! I dare you!

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:33.359
Hey—

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.069
I said stop!

00:11:59.593 --> 00:12:01.262
You were amazing, Minwoo.

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:04.807
Stepping in like that for Yooha…

00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:06.142
Director…

00:12:06.475 --> 00:12:08.018
this isn't the time for jokes.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.813
I'm not joking. I mean it.

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:14.191
You were worried about Yooha, weren't you?

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:20.573
Or… was it me you were worried about?

00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:30.916
I'm sorry… for dragging you into this mess.

00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:34.170
And thank you.

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:39.550
It's okay. I just did what I had to.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:42.720
Let's go, Yooha.

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:45.181
Already?

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.933
I was hoping to hang out a little longer.

00:12:50.978 --> 00:12:52.062
Ah…

00:12:52.062 --> 00:12:53.564
Scary~

00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.399
Got it.

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.903
See you again, Yooha.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.155
Yes.

00:13:04.408 --> 00:13:05.534
Goodbye.

00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:29.642
They didn't have tofu at the convenience store…
So I bought soy milk instead.

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.003
I'll compensate you.

00:13:59.004 --> 00:13:59.922
Huh?

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.551
It was my fault.

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:08.430
I introduced you to Suyeon.

00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:15.854
You don't have to.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.649
No, I need to make it right.

00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:21.527
Do you think money solves everything, Minwoo?

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:23.153
That's not what I meant…

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:28.367
We have a contract, and because of that…

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:32.913
I think that's my responsibility, too.

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:36.375
I acted inappropriately as the client.

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:43.799
So that's all we are.

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:48.429
Ours was just a relationship built on a contract —

00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:52.224
nothing more, nothing less.

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:59.356
I never saw this as a real relationship.
But you…

00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:02.109
Yooha, I...

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:03.569
Please stop.

00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:08.282
I'm fine.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.619
Just treat me according to the contract…

00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:15.372
like how a client would.

00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:39.832
Hello, my name is Son Taeha.

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:43.127
I run a small bar, and I'm Yooha's older brother.

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:44.336
And this young man?

00:16:45.045 --> 00:16:46.171
Hello.

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:48.424
I'm Bae Jaemin.

00:16:48.882 --> 00:16:53.929
I'm Yooha's schoolmate, and now his closest friend.

00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:57.433
I didn't know it before,
but Jaemin is actually really good with his hands.

00:16:57.433 --> 00:17:00.436
He's eager to work and very diligent.

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.271
Though he still makes a lot of mistakes.

00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:06.442
But I think he'll get better with time,
so I'm looking forward to seeing his growth.

00:17:06.942 --> 00:17:09.611
There's still a lot I need to learn.

00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:12.322
And honestly, I've made so many mistakes.

00:17:12.322 --> 00:17:16.368
Lately, Taeha's been scolding me a lot too.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.995
No, no, that's…

00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:21.582
It's just because you get so down when you make mistakes.
I'm not actually that angry.

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:23.125
I have high hopes for him.

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:27.004
Honestly, everything he does looks so cool to me.

00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:30.174
I want to be like him someday.

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:32.926
You're doing well already.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:36.013
Hearing you say that really reassures me.

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:38.432
But I'll work even harder.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.100
Please watch me grow.

00:17:40.517 --> 00:17:42.436
Yes, please keep an eye on our Jaemin.

00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:43.937
- We're counting on him.
- You too, Taeha.

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:45.564
- I also…
- I was speaking!

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:46.899
You too, Taeha. Watch me.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.400
Bye~
