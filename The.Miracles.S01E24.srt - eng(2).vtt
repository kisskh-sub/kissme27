WEBVTT

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.320
Practice diligently, keep skills close

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.760
Cultivate righteousness, avoid reckless conflict

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.280
Be gentle in your worldly dealings

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.239
Support the weak, use martial arts to aid benevolence

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.120
I've read everyone's resumes

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:36.280
It's fair to say

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.120
you come from all over the country

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.000
masters of the dance world

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.840
I want to ask you all a question

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:42.719
Why did you come to Shenzhen

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.040
I want the chance to realize

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.840
my childhood dream

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.120
Since I was small, I've always dreamed of being the lead on stage

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.319
And Shenzhen is a hotbed for all dreamers

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.599
Soon, the troupe started creating the dance drama *Wing Chun*

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.560
From that day on, I strove to become Ip Man

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.799
Master Ip

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:07.480
Please

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:08.479
Please

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.360
Wanting to be Master Ip

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.520
isn't that easy, is it?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.360
Come on, learn from the movie

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:25.240
Let me see

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.960
Come on, Bong Sau

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:32.360
Fook Sau

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.120
Sun-Character Thrust Punch

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.840
Right, right, right

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.680
This move is cool, this move is cool

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.280
Careful, careful

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:43.159
Pick up the speed

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.039
That one

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.520
It's good for a young man to have drive

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.199
It seems this Master Ip

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.080
is hard to play

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.120
To combine martial arts and dance

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.080
together

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.240
is even harder

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.080
Dance is about posture and rhythm

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.639
Martial arts is about power and striking

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.319
To merge these two things together

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.680
isn't just about imitating movements

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.520
We have to follow the martial arts coach first

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.639
and learn every move and style

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.400
Then slowly infuse the power into the dance

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:29.639
But power and dance feel

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.520
are like two streams of water

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.919
To make them flow together

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.719
you have to grind and practice repeatedly

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.360
Practiced again and again

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.360
still can't catch the feeling

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.599
I started to panic a bit inside

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.400
Even doubting

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.639
if I

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:50.919
can really do it

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.080
Hongji

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.120
Is the Ip Man training going well

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.400
It's okay

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.879
Just can't find the character's feeling

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.199
Mom believes you can definitely do it

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.160
I have a dream

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.839
When I grow up

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.480
I want to go to a bigger stage

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.120
to dance

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:38.279
To be the lead once

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:40.879
Mom coming to watch me dance

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.120
will definitely be very happy

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.319
Don't cry, don't cry

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.439
I believe in you

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.240
You will definitely dance the best in the future

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.360
You two rascals

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.560
If you don't play on the stage

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:45.920
why are you playing here

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.439
Are you out of your minds

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:48.560
Let me do it. Sorry, Auntie

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.879
Keep practicing

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:54.319
Okay

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.759
The human mind is precarious; the mind of the Way is subtle

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.240
Be discriminating and unified; hold fast to the Mean

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.240
I wish to support and protect the people

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:06.199
It is indeed difficult

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:08.959
Only by overcoming difficulties can one perfect virtue

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.680
Dragging my tired body home every day

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.199
the frustration of losing direction followed me like a shadow

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:19.000
Just like that tango competition in my childhood

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.639
Mom's encouragement

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:22.680
childhood determination

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.199
calmed me down

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:27.759
The firmness of martial arts

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.560
the softness of dance

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:32.759
firmness and softness complementing each other

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:35.120
Internal tension, external relaxation

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.680
Merging hardness with gentle beauty

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.759
Dancing out a dance language unique to China

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.720
At that moment, I finally understood.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.480
Dance isn't just striking a pose.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.439
And martial arts isn't just throwing punches and kicks.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.360
Dance and martial arts aren't just techniques.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.240
They are a conviction.

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:29.120
The body is an extension of the heart.

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:36.399
Mom, I think I've realized it.

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:38.160
Every punch, every palm strike.

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:39.319
Every step, every dance.

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:41.399
It's not simply imitating Ip Man.

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:43.560
But taking his strength as the core,

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:46.439
and softening it into a new, modern context.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.439
To truly fuse dance and martial arts

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:51.240
together on the stage.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.759
Our dance drama, "Wing Chun,"

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:55.560
is a first.

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:58.560
This is both a brand-new attempt

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.360
and a bold challenge.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.120
But fusion is exactly what we want.

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:05.360
We want breakthroughs and innovation.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:05.879
Right?

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:07.000
Right!

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:11.759
Mom,

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.759
that dream I wrote about

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:14.680
in my essays as a child...

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.199
Today, I've really achieved it.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.240
I want you to see for yourself

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.759
who I've grown up to be.

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:22.000
To see how I stand on that stage.

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:24.120
Tomorrow

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.920
is our premiere.

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:29.839
Honestly, is everyone nervous?

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.399
Nervous!

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.320
Do you remember in the movie "Ip Man,"

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.440
there's a specific line?

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.000
"I want to fight ten!"

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:42.399
Ip Man wasn't just fighting with his fists.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:43.559
It was a spirit.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.080
It was a spirit.

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:45.320
Right.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.200
Wing Chun

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.559
is authentic Chinese Kung Fu.

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:52.639
In the future, when you have the chance

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:54.000
to stand on the world stage,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.519
what you represent

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.919
is the spirit of the Chinese people.

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:00.200
It is the vast Chinese culture.

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:01.240
Remember,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.240
what you express through dance

00:09:03.799 --> 00:09:05.559
is the image of the Chinese people.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.080
Good, good, good!

00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:16.080
Mom, I did it.

00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:18.320
When I was little, I said

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.759
I wanted to stand on a bigger stage.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.159
But today I finally understand,

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.279
it's not about how big the stage is.

00:12:24.559 --> 00:12:26.519
It's about using our own artistic creation

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:28.559
to let the world see the Chinese spirit.

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:40.840
Wing Chun.

00:12:40.919 --> 00:12:41.440
Please.

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:42.440
Wing Chun.

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:43.159
Please.

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:47.440
Practice diligently, keep skills sharp.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.960
Cultivate righteousness, avoid conflict.

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:57.279
Be gentle in your manner.

00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:01.799
Support the weak, use martial arts for benevolence.
