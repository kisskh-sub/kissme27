WEBVTT

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:17.894
Ms. Li, your schedule
needs a new addition.

00:00:18.174 --> 00:00:19.333
Every Friday,

00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:22.095
you are required to accompany the boss
on an outing.

00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:25.133
That doesn't look like me at all.

00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:26.614
Your skill is getting worse.

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:29.054
Looks like you have
had no time for drawing

00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:30.614
since you became Chairman.

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:44.960
That bakery in the west district
is shutting down.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.455
These are their last almond croissants.
If you're late, you miss it.

00:00:47.574 --> 00:00:48.574
Where should I sit?

00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:49.775
Are we taking a cab?

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:05.293
What are you doing?

00:01:05.294 --> 00:01:06.414
I'm fastening your seat belt.

00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:08.134
What kind of melodrama
are you acting out?

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:09.414
You're choking my neck.

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:10.294
Sorry.

00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:12.454
Sorry?

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:14.374
Do you even know how to do it?

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:20.934
This amount of calories could
power me through half a day of meetings.

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:22.895
In that case, you're writing
today's report for me.

00:01:27.494 --> 00:01:28.213
Should you

00:01:28.214 --> 00:01:29.894
review workplace etiquette again?

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:31.895
At the very least,
you should thank the boss.

00:01:33.414 --> 00:01:35.335
I can report you
for workplace harassment.

00:01:38.455 --> 00:01:39.975
Where are we going now?

00:01:41.214 --> 00:01:42.055
A secret.

00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:43.895
Childish.

00:01:45.774 --> 00:01:47.055
You're the mature one.

00:01:58.275 --> 00:01:59.619
=Secret By My Name=

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.599

Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.370
=Episode 8=

00:02:04.694 --> 00:02:06.133
Do you want this?

00:02:06.134 --> 00:02:07.174
Yes.

00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:08.734
If you do,
let's play rock-paper-scissors.

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:09.333
Okay.

00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:10.855
If you win, I'll give it to you, okay?

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:11.615
Come on.

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:14.414
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:16.895
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:02:17.494 --> 00:02:18.333
Alright, alright.

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:19.254
You win.

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:20.174
Here you go.

00:02:20.175 --> 00:02:21.454
Thank you, big sister.

00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:22.213
You are welcome.

00:02:22.214 --> 00:02:24.175
Ms. Li, your negotiation skills
have slipped.

00:02:24.334 --> 00:02:26.055
You can't beat a child.

00:02:27.255 --> 00:02:29.495
Mr. Tan, on the other hand,
has improved.

00:02:29.575 --> 00:02:31.574
You used to only make little rabbits.

00:02:31.575 --> 00:02:33.414
Now you have switched to abstract art.

00:02:33.975 --> 00:02:35.215
There's something on your head.

00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:36.414
Where?

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:39.773
Come on, come on.

00:02:39.774 --> 00:02:40.814
I'm coming.

00:02:40.855 --> 00:02:42.014
Childish.

00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:43.213
There are so many people around.

00:02:43.214 --> 00:02:44.335
It's gone.

00:02:47.895 --> 00:02:48.454
Thank you.

00:02:48.455 --> 00:02:49.694
Sorry for the trouble.

00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:50.333
Not at all.

00:02:50.334 --> 00:02:50.653
Come on.

00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:51.694
Say thank you to big sister.

00:02:51.695 --> 00:02:52.574
Thank you, big sister.

00:02:52.575 --> 00:02:55.615
I'll give you
my favorite fairy tale book.

00:02:56.814 --> 00:02:57.933
Thank you.

00:02:57.934 --> 00:02:58.813
You're welcome.

00:02:58.814 --> 00:02:59.773
Say goodbye.

00:02:59.774 --> 00:03:01.254
Goodbye, big sister.

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:02.493
Bye-bye.

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:03.814
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

00:03:04.094 --> 00:03:05.640
Shall we go take a look over there?

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.933
Okay.

00:03:05.934 --> 00:03:07.575
Alright, let's go.

00:03:07.814 --> 00:03:09.175
Off we go.

00:03:17.774 --> 00:03:18.974
Dad.

00:03:32.225 --> 00:03:34.845
♪It has been so long
since I last saw you♪

00:03:35.654 --> 00:03:36.894
When we were kids,

00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:38.575
we loved reading fairy tales.

00:03:39.175 --> 00:03:40.773
We even argued over it back then.

00:03:40.774 --> 00:03:42.934
But now I only believe
in expired fairy tales,

00:03:43.175 --> 00:03:45.495
like the chemical experiment
that turns a prince into a frog.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.333
♪Yet even that cannot be fulfilled♪

00:03:48.334 --> 00:03:48.894
I'm leaving.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:49.895
I'll give you a ride.

00:03:49.934 --> 00:03:50.775
No need.

00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:52.335
I still have somewhere to go.

00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:17.854
Alright.

00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:18.854
I'll be right there.

00:04:21.214 --> 00:04:23.853
I'm stepping out for a moment.
Watch carefully. Don't leave here.

00:04:23.854 --> 00:04:25.054
Understood, Mr. Liang.

00:04:44.654 --> 00:04:46.854
Back then, you forced my dad
to take his own life.

00:04:47.294 --> 00:04:48.014
My mom told me

00:04:48.015 --> 00:04:50.294
it only took him three days
to make that decision.

00:04:54.414 --> 00:04:56.815
Now I'll give you
thirty seconds to breathe.

00:04:58.135 --> 00:05:01.294
Do you think that's enough to understand
what it felt like for him to wait for death?

00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:13.882
Do not rush.

00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:17.054
Wait until your own son, Tan Jianfei,

00:05:17.055 --> 00:05:19.255
personally seals the coffin for you.

00:05:20.334 --> 00:05:21.494
When that moment comes,

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:25.414
I'll dance in the red dress
you despise the most.

00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:42.854
What?

00:05:43.287 --> 00:05:44.768
My mom is missing?

00:05:52.174 --> 00:05:53.413
I've already checked.

00:05:53.414 --> 00:05:55.135
There's nothing
on the hospital cameras.

00:05:55.294 --> 00:05:58.135
It's likely that when she was taken,
they deliberately avoided surveillance.

00:05:59.015 --> 00:05:59.773
No.

00:05:59.774 --> 00:06:00.733
Pull every single footage

00:06:00.734 --> 00:06:03.215
one more time. I want to go through them
frame by frame.

00:06:57.255 --> 00:06:59.335
Ms. Li,

00:06:59.414 --> 00:07:03.614
you look far more striking than when
you were trying on wedding dresses.

00:07:08.015 --> 00:07:08.895
What?

00:07:09.654 --> 00:07:10.814
Did you come here

00:07:10.815 --> 00:07:11.935
to cry injustice at me?

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:14.575
What do you actually want?

00:07:15.455 --> 00:07:16.414
Shares?

00:07:16.974 --> 00:07:17.895
Patents?

00:07:18.135 --> 00:07:20.654
Or take me to a bridal shop
and make me kneel in public?

00:07:22.214 --> 00:07:23.494
Just say it.

00:07:31.734 --> 00:07:33.255
How pitiful.

00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:38.294
Eight years ago,

00:07:38.615 --> 00:07:40.773
when your dad was hanging
from the beam,

00:07:40.774 --> 00:07:44.294
did you beg that old man like this too?

00:07:51.575 --> 00:07:52.534
Too bad.

00:07:52.615 --> 00:07:55.015
I'm only interested in
living leverage now.

00:07:58.935 --> 00:08:00.895
Tan Zuoyan, you're asking to die!

00:08:03.854 --> 00:08:05.895
So eager to stage a tragic act?

00:08:05.935 --> 00:08:07.973
Should I add

00:08:07.974 --> 00:08:09.375
some background music for you?

00:08:11.015 --> 00:08:12.135
Let her go.

00:08:13.815 --> 00:08:15.775
Mr. Tan, what are you playing at?

00:08:16.014 --> 00:08:17.934
When my dad was hanging
from the beam eight years ago,

00:08:17.935 --> 00:08:19.455
you didn't step up as a hero.

00:08:20.214 --> 00:08:22.294
Now you suddenly act like a saint.

00:08:23.375 --> 00:08:24.294
Shujing,

00:08:24.774 --> 00:08:25.333
we can...

00:08:25.334 --> 00:08:26.414
Shut up.

00:08:28.414 --> 00:08:30.335
Tan Zuoyan, what do you want?

00:08:35.255 --> 00:08:36.293
I want

00:08:36.294 --> 00:08:38.774
Tan Zheng'en.

00:08:44.615 --> 00:08:46.134
Any leads?

00:08:46.615 --> 00:08:47.655
Not yet.

00:08:49.294 --> 00:08:51.014
So the old man really is with you.

00:08:52.495 --> 00:08:53.614
How are the arrangements going

00:08:53.615 --> 00:08:54.533
for moving Tan Zheng'en?

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:55.854
When does the helicopter arrive?

00:08:56.015 --> 00:08:57.374
Everything is basically in place.

00:08:57.375 --> 00:08:59.453
The helicopter will land on the rooftop
in forty minutes.

00:08:59.454 --> 00:09:00.173
But

00:09:00.174 --> 00:09:01.894
Tan Zuoyan wants us
to hand him over first.

00:09:02.255 --> 00:09:03.935
You actually believe that nonsense?

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:05.894
If your mom were in his hands,

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:07.933
he would've sent a live video by now.

00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:09.415
Do you think he is a philanthropist?

00:09:11.694 --> 00:09:12.974
Calm your mind.

00:09:12.975 --> 00:09:14.053
Let's wait a bit longer.

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:15.614
Of course you're not in a hurry.

00:09:15.614 --> 00:09:17.494
You're afraid that
once Tan Zheng'en is handed over,

00:09:17.495 --> 00:09:19.575
the chairman of Tan Group
will become Tan Zuoyan, right?

00:09:22.135 --> 00:09:23.335
Is that how you see me?

00:09:26.495 --> 00:09:28.413
I honestly don't care
where Tan Zheng'en is

00:09:28.414 --> 00:09:29.134
or who he is with.

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:30.293
I truly do not.

00:09:30.294 --> 00:09:31.334
But I do know this.

00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:32.815
If you hand him over now,

00:09:32.934 --> 00:09:34.894
you'll be driving the final nail

00:09:35.135 --> 00:09:36.655
into your mom's coffin.

00:09:40.735 --> 00:09:41.535
Jingshu.

00:09:41.654 --> 00:09:43.494
Something about this is off.

00:09:43.895 --> 00:09:46.614
Tan Zuoyan keeps stalling and refuses
to make the exchange face-to-face.

00:09:46.615 --> 00:09:47.854
That is suspicious.

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:49.494
Is it possible

00:09:49.495 --> 00:09:51.655
that your mom isn't
in Tan Zuoyan's hands at all?

00:09:51.735 --> 00:09:53.655
Or maybe she went missing on her own?

00:09:53.694 --> 00:09:56.175
Even if there is only
a one percent chance, I have to try.

00:09:57.335 --> 00:09:58.974
We can hand over Tan Zheng'en,

00:09:58.975 --> 00:09:59.734
but we must

00:09:59.735 --> 00:10:01.494
see your mom first before doing so.

00:10:01.615 --> 00:10:03.334
If we give up our only leverage

00:10:03.335 --> 00:10:04.533
and then

00:10:04.534 --> 00:10:05.813
still do not see her,

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.094
we'll lose the upper hand.

00:10:17.934 --> 00:10:19.413
What's your problem?

00:10:19.414 --> 00:10:20.800
You shouldn't have played that card.

00:10:21.174 --> 00:10:23.374
You're making a mess of everything
like that madwoman.

00:10:23.375 --> 00:10:24.254
At least now

00:10:24.255 --> 00:10:25.535
she's finally asleep.

00:10:25.574 --> 00:10:26.413
Exactly.

00:10:26.414 --> 00:10:27.774
It's finally quiet for a while.

00:10:31.335 --> 00:10:33.415
Doesn't it feel a little too quiet?

00:10:39.335 --> 00:10:40.854
No way! She's gone!

00:10:41.855 --> 00:10:43.053
Alive!

00:10:43.054 --> 00:10:44.533
I wanted her alive.

00:10:44.534 --> 00:10:45.773
You useless lot!

00:10:45.774 --> 00:10:47.894
You couldn't even keep
one madwoman under watch, huh?

00:10:47.895 --> 00:10:50.134
If you can't handle that,
don't come back.

00:10:59.294 --> 00:11:00.695
Too many blind spots on the cameras.

00:11:01.654 --> 00:11:03.134
Still no leads.

00:11:17.694 --> 00:11:18.655
Mom.

00:11:20.774 --> 00:11:21.894
Shu… Shujing.

00:11:26.215 --> 00:11:28.774
If I lose my mother,

00:11:29.895 --> 00:11:32.254
then I really have no home left.

00:11:33.015 --> 00:11:33.894
Shujing.

00:11:34.654 --> 00:11:36.254
I'll help you find her.

00:11:38.855 --> 00:11:40.215
I'll stay by your side too.

00:11:40.975 --> 00:11:41.974
In the future,

00:11:43.095 --> 00:11:44.453
we could even have a child.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:46.134
You won't be without a home. We can...

00:11:46.135 --> 00:11:47.374
We can think of many ways.

00:11:47.375 --> 00:11:48.695
Get lost!

00:11:50.495 --> 00:11:51.813
This is where my dad

00:11:51.814 --> 00:11:53.695
was driven to his death
by the Tan family.

00:11:53.975 --> 00:11:56.894
And now, my mom can't live in peace.

00:12:01.255 --> 00:12:02.215
I'm sorry.
