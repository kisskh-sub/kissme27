WEBVTT

00:00:01.105 --> 00:00:04.265
The fact that the killer used
this game as a gimmick

00:00:04.345 --> 00:00:07.105
suggests they know them quite well.

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:10.225
I think Tonkla is definitely hiding
something from us.

00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:11.145
Who else knows about this?

00:00:11.225 --> 00:00:12.225
Just Champ.

00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:13.705
He helped me.

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:16.545
After Tonkla, who do you think
the next target will be?

00:00:20.105 --> 00:00:21.385
Next time, you should be careful.

00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:27.825
You're the first I've treated.

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:15.865
I'm sorry.

00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:18.985
I think

00:01:20.065 --> 00:01:21.345
my wound is fine now.

00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:24.305
Yeah.

00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:30.505
Well then, I'm going to get some rest.

00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:32.505
I've got a lot of work tomorrow.

00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:35.865
Yeah.

00:02:27.785 --> 00:02:29.025
Stop.

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:35.385
Just stop thinking.

00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:37.545
It was just a moment.

00:02:38.665 --> 00:02:39.745
A moment.

00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:42.945
A moment.

00:02:44.145 --> 00:02:45.905
What the hell kind of moment was that?

00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:49.665
Why am I overthinking this?

00:02:50.425 --> 00:02:55.105
Coworkers accidentally kissing
happens all the time, right?

00:02:58.265 --> 00:03:00.305
Don't overthink it.

00:04:16.425 --> 00:04:17.624
Good morning.

00:04:21.384 --> 00:04:22.905
The weather's nice today, isn't it?

00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:26.945
I'm heading to work now.

00:04:29.065 --> 00:04:31.025
At least stay and eat first.

00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:32.945
Jay bought a lot of food.

00:04:53.865 --> 00:04:57.145
Ta-da! Here you are.

00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:00.385
What is this?

00:05:00.465 --> 00:05:01.785
Breakfast.

00:05:03.025 --> 00:05:05.185
-Why do I only get this much?
-We ran out of it.

00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:07.665
Is your wound fully healed, Kamin?

00:05:08.905 --> 00:05:09.865
I'm fine now.

00:05:09.945 --> 00:05:12.265
"Kamin." Yeah. Whatever.
You two seem so close, huh?

00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:15.665
What are you complaining about?

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:20.585
Nothing.

00:05:20.665 --> 00:05:22.905
It's just that someone's
renting the house for a few nights,

00:05:22.985 --> 00:05:25.745
and you seem closer to him
than to your own brother.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.025
Of course.

00:05:27.105 --> 00:05:29.105
You're not exactly the type
people get close to.

00:05:29.185 --> 00:05:32.345
-I swear I'll smack you.
-Come on then. Hit me.

00:05:33.145 --> 00:05:35.625
Did you ever ask him
if he wants to be close to you?

00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:37.825
Since we're at it, bro,

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:42.425
if we're going to get closer,

00:05:43.105 --> 00:05:46.465
I want to know why you moved
from the US to Thailand.

00:05:50.505 --> 00:05:53.425
Well, my dad passed away.

00:05:54.545 --> 00:05:57.225
My mom wanted to retire.

00:05:57.865 --> 00:06:03.225
So we decided to sell the business
in the US and move to Thailand.

00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:04.225
It should be more comfortable here.

00:06:04.305 --> 00:06:06.585
Don't you get lonely?

00:06:06.665 --> 00:06:08.345
What about your partner?
What did they say?

00:06:08.425 --> 00:06:09.345
Are they okay with this?

00:06:09.425 --> 00:06:10.745
There isn't one.

00:06:11.425 --> 00:06:13.665
I don't have a partner.

00:06:15.425 --> 00:06:17.465
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:19.985
You're this handsome and still single?

00:06:20.065 --> 00:06:21.145
Or you're in talking stage with anyone?

00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:23.545
-Someone who--
-Hey, Jay.

00:06:24.185 --> 00:06:26.065
Why are you asking so much?

00:06:26.145 --> 00:06:28.065
Are you making a documentary about him?

00:06:28.145 --> 00:06:32.065
I'm just curious
what a cop's daily life is like.

00:06:32.145 --> 00:06:34.425
Look at you.
You're working all day, every day.

00:06:34.505 --> 00:06:35.745
I've never seen you date anyone.

00:06:35.825 --> 00:06:37.665
Not even once.

00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:41.265
But wait.

00:06:42.545 --> 00:06:44.065
Or do you actually have one?

00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:46.065
What about Yu?

00:06:47.225 --> 00:06:48.705
Are you two dating?

00:06:51.665 --> 00:06:53.385
Stop poking your nose
into other people's business.

00:06:53.465 --> 00:06:54.585
Eat up.

00:06:56.305 --> 00:06:57.305
Where are you going today?

00:06:57.385 --> 00:06:58.985
To campus. I have a presentation.

00:06:59.065 --> 00:07:01.025
You're not going.

00:07:01.105 --> 00:07:02.785
-What?
-Come with me.

00:07:02.865 --> 00:07:03.825
Why would you say that?

00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:05.145
It's graded, you know.

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:06.745
What kind of guardian are you?

00:07:06.825 --> 00:07:08.345
I'm worried about you.

00:07:09.065 --> 00:07:10.305
So what do you want?

00:07:10.385 --> 00:07:12.865
Your grades or your life?

00:07:21.545 --> 00:07:23.185
-Jay.
-Yeah?

00:07:24.065 --> 00:07:25.625
Find somewhere to sit.

00:07:25.705 --> 00:07:28.985
Don't get in anyone's way.
People are working here.

00:07:29.065 --> 00:07:31.465
Then I'll go downstairs
and get some coffee first.

00:07:31.545 --> 00:07:33.505
Do you want anything?

00:07:33.585 --> 00:07:35.025
No, I'm good.

00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:37.785
Won't you ask me?

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:43.865
Hey.

00:07:45.385 --> 00:07:47.345
Are you really going to act
like nothing happened?

00:07:50.945 --> 00:07:52.705
There was nothing.

00:07:54.065 --> 00:07:55.545
Kamin.

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:57.665
This is a workplace.

00:07:58.225 --> 00:07:59.505
Call me Inspector.

00:08:00.145 --> 00:08:01.705
Yes, Inspector.

00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:06.345
But could you at least tell me
what happened last night?

00:08:10.305 --> 00:08:12.145
If you're so distracted,

00:08:12.945 --> 00:08:14.865
shouldn't you get
a search warrant instead?

00:08:28.505 --> 00:08:29.825
WHERE ARE YOU? WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW UP
FOR THE PRESENTATION?

00:08:29.905 --> 00:08:31.665
Hey, pick up my call.

00:08:45.705 --> 00:08:47.225
Bell won't come?

00:08:49.745 --> 00:08:51.265
She didn't pick up my calls.

00:08:57.345 --> 00:08:58.265
Hello?

00:08:58.865 --> 00:09:00.065
Are you with Bell?

00:09:01.425 --> 00:09:02.905
Why would I be with Bell?

00:09:02.985 --> 00:09:05.105
You skipped your presentation.

00:09:05.185 --> 00:09:06.865
My brother told me to stay with him.

00:09:06.945 --> 00:09:08.465
He said he wanted to keep an eye on me.

00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:10.945
He's afraid something might happen.
Why are you asking about Bell?

00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:14.825
Bell didn't show up for the presentation.

00:09:14.905 --> 00:09:17.105
I called, but she didn't answer.

00:09:19.185 --> 00:09:20.905
Do you think

00:09:20.985 --> 00:09:23.425
this has something to do with the letter?

00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:34.505
Hello, Jay?

00:09:34.585 --> 00:09:38.345
Kamin, I think Bell is in danger.

00:09:39.465 --> 00:09:40.305
What's going on?

00:09:40.385 --> 00:09:41.785
Bell didn't go to class today.

00:09:41.865 --> 00:09:44.945
Cherreen called me,
saying she couldn't reach Bell at all,

00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:46.985
even with a presentation today.

00:09:47.065 --> 00:09:48.665
Maybe Bell's still working on it?

00:09:48.745 --> 00:09:49.865
That's impossible.

00:09:49.945 --> 00:09:51.665
She's very serious about studying.

00:09:51.745 --> 00:09:54.465
Even though she likes picking fights
with people, she never skips class.

00:09:54.545 --> 00:09:56.145
-Even when she's sick, she still shows up.
-Jay.

00:09:56.225 --> 00:09:58.345
You know where Bell's condo is, right?

00:09:59.305 --> 00:10:00.665
Inspector, good morning.

00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:04.225
-Anything unusual, Sergeant?
-No, sir.

00:10:04.305 --> 00:10:06.985
I've been watching since last night.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

00:10:07.065 --> 00:10:08.065
Let's go up, quickly.

00:10:09.265 --> 00:10:11.105
Let's go. Lead the way, Sergeant.

00:10:13.665 --> 00:10:14.625
Hey!

00:10:14.705 --> 00:10:15.585
What?

00:10:16.145 --> 00:10:18.625
Stay here. We'll go up ourselves.

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:38.785
This way, please.

00:10:49.585 --> 00:10:50.905
This is the room.

00:10:57.745 --> 00:10:59.145
May I have the key card, please?

00:11:19.505 --> 00:11:20.465
The smell is coming from this direction.

00:11:43.305 --> 00:11:45.025
-Shit!
-Sergeant.

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:46.745
Call for forensics.

00:11:47.385 --> 00:11:48.585
Now!

00:11:53.665 --> 00:11:54.985
Check everything thoroughly.

00:11:55.065 --> 00:11:56.145
Yes.

00:11:57.745 --> 00:12:00.985
Manmai, collect images over there first.

00:12:01.065 --> 00:12:02.305
Got it.

00:12:07.985 --> 00:12:09.585
Please take photos here as well.

00:12:18.625 --> 00:12:19.985
No fingerprints found.

00:12:20.065 --> 00:12:21.745
No footprints either.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:25.185
And there are no signs
of anyone else besides Bell.

00:12:29.185 --> 00:12:31.545
I'll leave the rest to you
to examine the evidence more closely.

00:12:34.785 --> 00:12:37.825
Doctor, it looks like a heavy day today.

00:12:38.945 --> 00:12:40.425
Not really.

00:12:40.505 --> 00:12:42.945
For you, Inspector, this is nothing.

00:12:44.705 --> 00:12:46.305
You don't have to do it for me.

00:12:47.305 --> 00:12:50.625
Just do your duty and find the truth.
That's enough.

00:12:53.465 --> 00:12:54.345
Yes.

00:12:54.425 --> 00:12:57.345
Doctor, we're done here.

00:12:58.025 --> 00:12:59.185
Okay.

00:12:59.265 --> 00:13:01.945
My team will head back first then.

00:13:03.585 --> 00:13:05.425
Here you are. A mask.

00:13:05.505 --> 00:13:07.385
Just in case there are
hazardous substances inside.

00:13:10.585 --> 00:13:11.945
Please take it.

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:14.665
Thank you.

00:13:14.745 --> 00:13:16.225
I'll get going now.

00:13:26.425 --> 00:13:27.465
Hey.

00:13:29.265 --> 00:13:30.625
Put on this mask.

00:13:34.705 --> 00:13:37.905
So you're worried about me?

00:13:38.945 --> 00:13:41.225
Captain, this is a crime scene.

00:13:41.305 --> 00:13:42.785
There could be dangerous substances.

00:13:44.545 --> 00:13:46.385
I'll wear it

00:13:46.465 --> 00:13:49.945
if you admit you're worried about me.

00:13:50.025 --> 00:13:51.825
Why do you have to turn
everything into a joke?

00:13:52.425 --> 00:13:53.625
Come here.

00:13:55.505 --> 00:13:57.265
Oh, I'll help.

00:13:57.345 --> 00:13:58.225
Come on, Inspector.

00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:00.505
Ouch, that hurts.

00:14:04.265 --> 00:14:05.945
If you hadn't been stubborn
in the first place,

00:14:06.025 --> 00:14:06.985
it wouldn't have hurt.

00:14:08.785 --> 00:14:11.745
If you'd just admitted
you were worried from the start,

00:14:11.825 --> 00:14:12.825
we'd be done already.

00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:20.945
Thank you.

00:15:12.225 --> 00:15:14.025
Talk to Jay properly, okay?

00:15:33.345 --> 00:15:35.825
-Are you okay?
-How could I be?

00:15:35.905 --> 00:15:37.705
My friend is dead!

00:15:37.785 --> 00:15:40.425
You said the police were watching us,
but why is there another body?

00:15:40.505 --> 00:15:41.505
Calm down, Jay.

00:15:41.585 --> 00:15:43.505
Calm my ass!

00:15:43.585 --> 00:15:45.785
I don't even know
if I'll be the next corpse!

00:16:01.545 --> 00:16:02.945
Jay,

00:16:04.585 --> 00:16:05.865
let me ask you.

00:16:06.945 --> 00:16:09.345
Did Bell and Cherreen
have any problems with each other?

00:16:13.265 --> 00:16:14.865
They were close.

00:16:16.625 --> 00:16:19.265
Cherreen was the only one
who had a key card to Bell's room.

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:36.145
What was your relationship with Bell?

00:16:36.225 --> 00:16:37.425
Well,

00:16:38.745 --> 00:16:40.305
we were friends.

00:16:41.785 --> 00:16:43.665
Can you tell us about your friend?

00:16:47.025 --> 00:16:49.105
Bell was serious about studying.

00:16:50.825 --> 00:16:53.025
She once said

00:16:53.105 --> 00:16:56.305
there were two things
she was good at in life.

00:16:57.065 --> 00:16:58.905
One was studying,

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:02.065
and the other was beating people up.

00:17:09.745 --> 00:17:10.785
You got some nerve, bitch!

00:17:10.865 --> 00:17:13.785
She was sharp-tongued
and good at picking fights.

00:17:13.865 --> 00:17:15.944
When someone in our group had trouble,

00:17:16.025 --> 00:17:18.385
she'd always be the one
to speak up for us.

00:17:19.865 --> 00:17:21.625
But sometimes she was way too reckless.

00:17:21.704 --> 00:17:22.865
Sit down!

00:17:22.944 --> 00:17:24.785
You think you're so tough?

00:17:28.025 --> 00:17:29.665
You're tough, huh?

00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:37.945
Bell had a motto.

00:17:39.105 --> 00:17:40.825
She can lose anything

00:17:41.945 --> 00:17:43.665
but will never lose face.

00:17:45.105 --> 00:17:46.785
There was one night

00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:52.785
when Bell told us
to drop her off at a condo.

00:17:52.865 --> 00:17:53.985
When we got there,

00:17:54.065 --> 00:17:57.785
she told us to turn off
the engine and the lights.

00:17:59.385 --> 00:18:01.185
So why did you bring us here?

00:18:04.105 --> 00:18:06.185
Then a woman walked out.

00:18:13.665 --> 00:18:14.745
Bitch!

00:18:15.425 --> 00:18:17.985
-Hey!
-Are you that damn horny?

00:18:20.665 --> 00:18:22.425
She splashed acid on her.

00:18:23.025 --> 00:18:25.585
You know that if she presses charges,

00:18:25.665 --> 00:18:27.865
you'll be charged
as an accomplice too, right?

00:18:27.945 --> 00:18:29.145
Are you aware of that?

00:18:29.225 --> 00:18:30.505
I know.

00:18:30.585 --> 00:18:32.705
I never thought Bell would do
something like that.

00:18:34.185 --> 00:18:36.145
Everything happened so fast.

00:18:37.065 --> 00:18:39.145
I really thought I did the best I could.

00:18:41.865 --> 00:18:44.945
She messaged me last night too,

00:18:45.865 --> 00:18:48.385
but I didn't understand what it meant.

00:18:49.065 --> 00:18:52.865
I called her back this morning,
but she didn't answer.

00:18:52.945 --> 00:18:55.145
I couldn't reach her at all.

00:18:58.545 --> 00:19:00.345
I'm not lying, officers.

00:19:00.425 --> 00:19:02.345
I'm telling the truth.

00:19:03.945 --> 00:19:05.945
Please believe me.

00:19:14.145 --> 00:19:16.705
THE NEXT TARGET? WHO IS THE KILLER?

00:19:22.785 --> 00:19:25.625
This case is similar
to the one at Drink Me.

00:19:26.305 --> 00:19:27.825
Between 1 and 2 a.m.,

00:19:27.905 --> 00:19:30.945
both the cameras in the lobby
and on Bell's floor,

00:19:31.025 --> 00:19:32.505
malfunctioned at the same time.

00:19:32.585 --> 00:19:35.545
So we can barely use any
of the condo's CCTV footage.

00:20:02.945 --> 00:20:04.385
Who says this is a dead end?

00:20:06.025 --> 00:20:07.345
Lieutenant Pai,

00:20:07.425 --> 00:20:10.665
track down the owner of this car
and get the footage.

00:20:10.745 --> 00:20:12.105
Got it.

00:20:17.345 --> 00:20:18.625
I'm coming for you.

00:20:25.185 --> 00:20:27.705
Captain, we've got something.

00:20:28.625 --> 00:20:30.105
Let's take a look.

00:20:32.305 --> 00:20:34.705
The footage is from
a dash cam we obtained.

00:20:43.705 --> 00:20:44.785
Wait.

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:48.745
From the CCTV timestamp,

00:20:48.825 --> 00:20:52.705
it's almost the same time
the condo's CCTV went down.

00:20:52.785 --> 00:20:55.105
So that means the culprit
likely used this route,

00:20:56.305 --> 00:20:59.785
sabotaged the CCTV first
and then carried out the crime.

00:21:03.185 --> 00:21:05.225
And what's this?

00:21:06.385 --> 00:21:07.305
Hold on.

00:21:16.905 --> 00:21:18.385
The culprit is probably wearing glasses.

00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:24.905
Wow, Inspector, you're amazing.

00:21:24.985 --> 00:21:26.825
They really are glasses.

00:21:40.585 --> 00:21:41.625
Why are you following me?

00:21:41.705 --> 00:21:44.065
Wow, Inspector.

00:21:44.625 --> 00:21:46.985
You're not even going to compliment me?

00:21:47.065 --> 00:21:48.105
For what?

00:21:48.185 --> 00:21:52.105
I went out of my way to find
an important lead on the suspect,

00:21:52.705 --> 00:21:54.665
and you're not going to praise me
even once?

00:21:56.265 --> 00:21:57.985
Wait, are you three years old?

00:21:58.065 --> 00:21:59.185
You need compliments?

00:22:03.745 --> 00:22:05.785
Fine, I'll praise you.

00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:10.625
Good boy.

00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:13.105
You did a great job.

00:22:14.345 --> 00:22:15.825
I'm not a dog.

00:22:19.545 --> 00:22:20.665
You're hard to please.

00:22:22.265 --> 00:22:24.945
Honestly, I didn't really want praise.

00:22:26.705 --> 00:22:28.065
I just wanted to try.

00:22:29.745 --> 00:22:31.865
At first, I thought
you wouldn't talk to me anymore.

00:22:33.625 --> 00:22:37.505
But from what I could tell, I knew

00:22:38.185 --> 00:22:40.785
you couldn't resist arguing back with me.

00:22:50.105 --> 00:22:51.465
I already told you,

00:22:53.425 --> 00:22:54.745
my mouth works well.

00:23:12.345 --> 00:23:13.905
If you can handle it, then just endure it.

00:23:24.865 --> 00:23:27.505
The acid caused the skin
at the affected area

00:23:27.585 --> 00:23:29.305
to turn grayish white,

00:23:29.385 --> 00:23:31.825
with some parts turning black.

00:23:32.345 --> 00:23:38.665
In the stomach, we also found
sulfuric acid and hydrofluoric acid.

00:23:40.625 --> 00:23:42.265
The glass-etching one.

00:23:44.625 --> 00:23:45.545
Yes, exactly.

00:23:46.265 --> 00:23:48.225
You really are impressive, Inspector.

00:23:55.465 --> 00:23:59.305
Who could even buy that much acid
to soak a body?

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:01.585
That's the thing.

00:24:01.665 --> 00:24:05.625
The manner of death is brutally inhumane.

00:24:08.985 --> 00:24:11.945
The culprit probably bought all
from the black market.

00:24:12.465 --> 00:24:17.025
And they must have quite a bit
of knowledge in chemistry.

00:24:17.825 --> 00:24:21.625
Also, I've just sent tissue samples
for further analysis.

00:24:21.705 --> 00:24:24.785
I'll update you if there's anything new.

00:24:25.465 --> 00:24:27.025
Thank you.

00:24:27.705 --> 00:24:28.865
In that case,

00:24:28.945 --> 00:24:30.265
may I have your phone number?

00:24:30.345 --> 00:24:31.465
So I can call you with updates.

00:24:37.065 --> 00:24:38.385
You already have my email.

00:24:38.465 --> 00:24:39.825
Email isn't fast enough.

00:24:40.905 --> 00:24:44.585
Also, if something urgent comes up,
I can call you right away.

00:24:45.385 --> 00:24:47.345
Email is just text.

00:24:47.425 --> 00:24:49.225
I want to hear your voice,

00:24:49.305 --> 00:24:51.985
so I know what you're thinking.

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:54.825
Sure.

00:24:56.305 --> 00:24:58.425
Take my number first, Doctor.

00:24:58.505 --> 00:25:02.465
The Inspector is very busy.

00:25:02.545 --> 00:25:04.905
He won't have time to answer your calls.

00:25:04.985 --> 00:25:06.465
Here you go.

00:25:08.265 --> 00:25:09.745
If anything happens, call me.

00:25:16.385 --> 00:25:17.625
Inspector…

00:25:19.905 --> 00:25:22.945
A murder this serious…
What are the police even doing?

00:25:23.025 --> 00:25:26.625
I feel so bad for Bell. She has no family.

00:25:26.705 --> 00:25:29.225
What the hell is going on
with the Avengers?

00:25:51.265 --> 00:25:53.185
I already made the image.

00:25:53.265 --> 00:25:55.105
Just share it in the class group chat.

00:25:56.145 --> 00:25:57.985
YOU'RE INVITED TO A MERIT-MAKING CEREMONY

00:25:58.065 --> 00:25:59.225
IN MEMORY OF PUNNITA THOMANART (BELL)

00:25:59.825 --> 00:26:01.385
Stay strong, everyone.

00:26:01.985 --> 00:26:03.625
This will pass.

00:26:03.705 --> 00:26:05.465
Are you guys going?

00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:07.985
We might find out who's next.

00:27:07.585 --> 00:27:08.665
Hey.

00:27:10.425 --> 00:27:12.145
What exactly is your problem
with Dr. Tankhun?

00:27:12.745 --> 00:27:14.185
You've been like this since the hospital,

00:27:14.785 --> 00:27:16.385
and now even at home.

00:27:17.265 --> 00:27:19.305
Shouldn't I be asking that instead?

00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:22.105
The one running away from the problem

00:27:22.185 --> 00:27:24.945
and refusing to talk
about what happened isn't me.

00:27:25.025 --> 00:27:26.545
It's you.

00:27:26.625 --> 00:27:27.825
Why?

00:27:28.665 --> 00:27:30.185
Did you want to kiss me and then run away?

00:27:30.265 --> 00:27:31.305
Lower your voice.

00:27:31.385 --> 00:27:32.385
This is my house.

00:27:32.465 --> 00:27:34.345
We aren't alone, are we?

00:27:35.265 --> 00:27:37.105
Are you afraid Jay might hear us,

00:27:39.065 --> 00:27:41.305
or is it that
you don't feel anything for me?

00:27:44.105 --> 00:27:45.545
Captain, here's the thing.

00:27:45.625 --> 00:27:49.745
Inspector, if you have something to say,
say it straight.

00:27:49.825 --> 00:27:51.865
We kissed once.

00:27:52.425 --> 00:27:54.025
I don't think much of it.

00:27:55.425 --> 00:27:57.385
I just don't like people who aren't clear,

00:27:58.665 --> 00:28:00.265
plus the whole renting-the-house thing.

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:02.105
Can we talk about this later?

00:28:02.665 --> 00:28:05.585
You know how chaotic
the case is right now.

00:28:05.665 --> 00:28:07.665
It's actually very simple.

00:28:07.745 --> 00:28:08.785
Just sign it.

00:28:08.865 --> 00:28:10.425
You've read the details already.

00:28:10.505 --> 00:28:12.825
I want to read it carefully one more time.

00:28:12.905 --> 00:28:14.425
I'll give you three days.

00:28:15.145 --> 00:28:16.185
What's with you?

00:28:16.265 --> 00:28:18.705
I'll come back for your answer

00:28:20.305 --> 00:28:21.785
both about the lease

00:28:22.945 --> 00:28:23.865
and about the kiss.

00:28:30.425 --> 00:28:32.265
Fine.

00:28:33.665 --> 00:28:34.865
Three days it is.

00:28:34.945 --> 00:28:38.345
But when we're on duty,
try to be professional, okay?

00:28:38.425 --> 00:28:40.345
I can do that, of course.

00:28:40.425 --> 00:28:42.865
Watch yourself.

00:28:42.945 --> 00:28:44.865
You might be the one who cannot handle it.

00:28:53.025 --> 00:28:54.665
He's sulking again.

00:29:05.305 --> 00:29:06.505
Please mindfully pour the water

00:29:06.585 --> 00:29:09.225
and dedicate the merit
to your karmic creditors.

00:29:09.865 --> 00:29:11.465
Not many people showed up.

00:29:12.905 --> 00:29:15.545
Given her past, that's not too surprising.

00:29:15.625 --> 00:29:17.665
Her friend group is pretty bonded though.

00:29:18.425 --> 00:29:20.385
Even though the body was seized,

00:29:21.425 --> 00:29:22.905
they still held a ceremony first.

00:29:22.985 --> 00:29:25.265
What about Puifai and Tar's
merit ceremony?

00:29:25.345 --> 00:29:27.465
They both have families.

00:29:28.305 --> 00:29:29.865
Their families already arranged that.

00:29:37.225 --> 00:29:38.465
Thanks a lot.

00:29:40.225 --> 00:29:41.665
See you.

00:29:49.825 --> 00:29:52.345
At a time like this,
you're still thinking about taking money?

00:29:56.905 --> 00:29:58.185
No one will know.

00:29:59.905 --> 00:30:02.265
You said you'd protect me.

00:30:02.345 --> 00:30:05.025
Do you really think
you can protect me by acting like this?

00:30:06.385 --> 00:30:07.545
I can.

00:30:07.625 --> 00:30:08.745
If it weren't for me today,

00:30:09.385 --> 00:30:11.185
it might've been your ceremony.

00:30:11.265 --> 00:30:12.785
What do you mean?

00:30:12.865 --> 00:30:15.145
That truth or dare letter thing.

00:30:15.225 --> 00:30:18.305
This time, it wasn't just Bell
who got one.

00:30:23.105 --> 00:30:24.185
I did too.

00:30:31.825 --> 00:30:33.345
You…

00:30:33.425 --> 00:30:34.345
Yes.

00:30:35.105 --> 00:30:37.505
I was the one who chose
Bell's name instead of yours.

00:30:39.705 --> 00:30:41.265
See, Cher?

00:30:41.345 --> 00:30:44.945
I don't have to be
an MP's son to protect you.

00:30:48.145 --> 00:30:49.625
I'll protect you myself.

00:30:57.945 --> 00:31:00.625
Cherreen is definitely hiding
something from us.

00:31:01.225 --> 00:31:05.105
We saw that the letter Bell received
had Cherreen's name on it.

00:31:06.505 --> 00:31:09.825
So whose letter had Bell's name on it?

00:31:11.185 --> 00:31:14.785
Someone must have received a letter
and hasn't told us yet.

00:31:16.465 --> 00:31:18.545
And that person could be Tonkla.

00:31:48.625 --> 00:31:50.465
Hey! Where are you going?

00:31:53.705 --> 00:31:55.145
What the hell is this?

00:31:59.105 --> 00:32:00.825
There's something we need to check.

00:32:00.905 --> 00:32:03.985
Check what? I'm not the culprit.

00:32:04.065 --> 00:32:05.545
We'll see soon enough.

00:32:07.305 --> 00:32:10.265
We searched the cabinet and found
a flash drive, but it's encrypted.

00:32:18.785 --> 00:32:20.385
What is this flash drive?

00:32:22.865 --> 00:32:24.105
It's a flash drive that…

00:32:26.705 --> 00:32:28.745
-If you want to know, find out yourself.
-He's asking nicely.

00:32:28.825 --> 00:32:30.345
-Can't you answer nicely?
-So what?

00:32:30.425 --> 00:32:32.425
Hey, it's okay.

00:32:43.345 --> 00:32:45.305
You don't have to tell us right away.

00:32:47.025 --> 00:32:49.145
Either way,
you'll be staying here for a while.

00:32:50.545 --> 00:32:51.425
Take him.

00:32:52.105 --> 00:32:53.785
-Move.
-Where are you taking me?

00:32:53.865 --> 00:32:55.425
-Now.
-What the hell? I'm not going!

00:32:55.505 --> 00:32:57.385
You don't need to know where. Now!

00:32:57.465 --> 00:32:58.785
Get lost!

00:33:18.985 --> 00:33:20.665
-Sergeant.
-Yes?

00:33:20.745 --> 00:33:21.945
Let's go.

00:33:43.105 --> 00:33:44.225
Hello, Inspector.

00:33:44.305 --> 00:33:45.185
Hello.

00:33:45.825 --> 00:33:47.945
I'm here to summarize yesterday's results.

00:33:48.945 --> 00:33:50.545
Oh, wait a moment.

00:33:53.425 --> 00:33:54.545
Here.

00:33:54.625 --> 00:33:57.865
I was worried you might be tired,
so I bought you this.

00:34:04.105 --> 00:34:05.345
Thank you.

00:34:05.905 --> 00:34:06.825
You're welcome.

00:34:06.905 --> 00:34:09.465
Then shall we eat inside?

00:34:09.545 --> 00:34:10.665
All right.

00:34:10.744 --> 00:34:11.945
Okay.

00:34:12.705 --> 00:34:14.465
Captain, please bring it along.

00:34:15.145 --> 00:34:16.425
After you.

00:34:18.985 --> 00:34:21.385
Here, Inspector. Try some.

00:34:21.465 --> 00:34:23.145
This place makes really good desserts.

00:34:23.225 --> 00:34:24.465
Thank you.

00:34:24.545 --> 00:34:25.824
No problem.

00:34:33.145 --> 00:34:34.585
It's okay.

00:34:34.665 --> 00:34:36.344
There are plenty left.

00:34:40.505 --> 00:34:42.185
Here you are. Try it.

00:34:52.945 --> 00:34:55.905
Shall we get started then?

00:34:55.985 --> 00:34:58.265
Oh, sure.

00:35:01.185 --> 00:35:05.105
Do you remember earlier
we found ketamine in Tar's body?

00:35:05.705 --> 00:35:07.505
According to what Mirin told us,

00:35:07.585 --> 00:35:09.865
ketamine was found all over Bell's room.

00:35:10.825 --> 00:35:13.305
But before these student murder cases,

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:17.825
I've also encountered other bodies
that contained ketamine.

00:35:17.905 --> 00:35:21.945
So does that mean it's the same killer?

00:35:24.705 --> 00:35:28.185
I don't think so yet.

00:35:29.105 --> 00:35:31.985
The manner of death is different.

00:35:32.905 --> 00:35:37.345
But I'm certain the drugs
came from the same source.

00:35:38.465 --> 00:35:42.105
Right, I remember now.

00:35:42.185 --> 00:35:44.705
This drug spread around
quite a bit at one point.

00:35:47.865 --> 00:35:50.545
Anyway, thank you
for letting us know, Doctor.

00:35:51.745 --> 00:35:53.065
My pleasure.

00:35:53.625 --> 00:35:56.145
And if you don't mind,

00:35:56.945 --> 00:35:58.945
-may I have your number--
-I do mind.

00:36:00.945 --> 00:36:01.865
I'm in a hurry.

00:36:02.665 --> 00:36:06.185
Let's go, Inspector, or we'll be late.

00:36:08.665 --> 00:36:10.505
-Inspector…
-Hey.

00:36:12.305 --> 00:36:13.185
Wait.

00:36:15.665 --> 00:36:16.545
Where are we going?

00:36:18.865 --> 00:36:20.385
Well…

00:36:20.465 --> 00:36:22.425
I'm taking you out

00:36:22.505 --> 00:36:23.505
on patrol.

00:36:24.105 --> 00:36:24.945
Patrol?

00:36:26.425 --> 00:36:27.305
Where?

00:36:27.945 --> 00:36:29.505
Wait, where?

00:36:29.585 --> 00:36:33.505
I just remembered where those kids
arrange drug deliveries.

00:36:34.305 --> 00:36:35.345
So we're going there.

00:36:35.425 --> 00:36:36.385
Right now?

00:36:36.465 --> 00:36:37.705
Yeah.

00:36:38.825 --> 00:36:42.145
What about Tonkla,
the one we just brought in?

00:36:42.225 --> 00:36:43.905
Who's going to question him?

00:36:49.345 --> 00:36:50.625
Right.

00:36:50.705 --> 00:36:51.745
How about this?

00:36:52.305 --> 00:36:54.865
You and Lieutenant Ken go ahead.

00:36:54.945 --> 00:36:57.385
I'll finish up here
and follow right after.

00:36:59.745 --> 00:37:01.225
All right.

00:37:01.305 --> 00:37:02.825
Take care of it for me.

00:37:04.985 --> 00:37:05.905
Yes.

00:37:07.545 --> 00:37:08.425
Wait.

00:37:11.625 --> 00:37:14.465
Anything else you'd like me
to take care of?

00:37:17.585 --> 00:37:19.065
Be careful.

00:37:24.385 --> 00:37:25.585
Come on, Inspector.

00:37:26.465 --> 00:37:29.185
If you're worried,
just say you're worried.

00:37:36.025 --> 00:37:37.105
I'm worried.

00:37:45.465 --> 00:37:46.665
Then…

00:37:47.425 --> 00:37:48.345
I'll see you at home.

00:38:05.065 --> 00:38:06.625
Hey, stop!

00:38:10.385 --> 00:38:11.745
Where the hell are you running to,
you punk?

00:38:11.825 --> 00:38:12.825
I'm sorry.

00:38:12.905 --> 00:38:14.585
I'm sorry! I won't do it again!

00:38:14.665 --> 00:38:16.385
You'll be punished for sure.

00:38:17.785 --> 00:38:19.465
But right now, tell me.
Where did you get the drugs?

00:38:20.585 --> 00:38:21.865
I can't tell you.

00:38:21.945 --> 00:38:24.105
You think I'm negotiating with you, huh?

00:38:24.745 --> 00:38:25.665
I'll ask again!

00:38:25.745 --> 00:38:26.785
I'm sorry.

00:38:27.385 --> 00:38:28.585
Where did you get the drugs?

00:38:32.025 --> 00:38:33.105
I'm sorry.

00:38:36.185 --> 00:38:38.665
-I'm sorry.
-I'm counting to three.

00:38:38.745 --> 00:38:39.985
Three!

00:38:40.065 --> 00:38:41.305
Sorry, sir.

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:42.705
-Two!
-Wild Hunt.

00:38:42.785 --> 00:38:44.785
-What?
-Wild Hunt.

00:38:46.345 --> 00:38:47.825
That's it.

00:38:48.545 --> 00:38:50.745
Ken, take it from here.

00:38:50.825 --> 00:38:51.705
Yes.

00:38:51.785 --> 00:38:52.825
Turn around.

00:38:53.425 --> 00:38:55.145
Now. Hands behind your back.

00:39:09.545 --> 00:39:11.065
Hey!

00:39:14.865 --> 00:39:15.985
Hello?

00:39:16.065 --> 00:39:22.625
Have you ever heard that
curiosity kills the cat?

00:39:23.345 --> 00:39:24.425
Who are you?

00:39:25.305 --> 00:39:27.985
I understand you're new.

00:39:28.065 --> 00:39:30.585
You probably don't know much yet.

00:39:30.665 --> 00:39:33.625
Let this be a lesson.

00:39:34.265 --> 00:39:35.385
What do you mean by that?

00:39:35.465 --> 00:39:36.665
Hey!

00:39:44.665 --> 00:39:45.625
Jade!

00:39:45.705 --> 00:39:50.905
KAMIN

00:40:09.545 --> 00:40:11.305
I heard you were looking for me.

00:40:12.505 --> 00:40:14.865
Captain, you really wanted to see me,
didn't you?

00:40:17.785 --> 00:40:19.265
It's me, Seon Jae.

00:40:22.905 --> 00:40:25.385
Lieutenant, where is Captain Jade now?

00:40:25.465 --> 00:40:27.665
He went after a drug case at Wild Hunt.

00:40:27.745 --> 00:40:29.785
Send me the location now.

00:40:38.105 --> 00:40:39.825
KAMIN

00:40:41.345 --> 00:40:42.745
Pick up my call!

00:41:05.425 --> 00:41:07.585
Lieutenant, send backup immediately.

00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:09.345
Captain is in danger.

00:41:12.865 --> 00:41:15.665
THE NIGHT BEFORE

00:41:20.265 --> 00:41:21.865
Hey.

00:41:21.945 --> 00:41:24.225
That's filthy. It's my bed.

00:41:24.985 --> 00:41:26.265
Come on.

00:41:26.345 --> 00:41:28.065
I'm exhausted.

00:41:28.145 --> 00:41:29.665
Can't you let me lie down for a bit?

00:41:34.705 --> 00:41:37.785
Inspector, since you're wearing pajamas,
come to sleep already.

00:41:38.465 --> 00:41:40.185
You work like a robot.

00:41:40.265 --> 00:41:41.745
Don't you know how to rest?

00:41:41.825 --> 00:41:43.825
I just want to finish the case,

00:41:44.505 --> 00:41:46.505
so I won't have anything to worry about.

00:41:47.225 --> 00:41:50.545
If you can't sleep tonight,

00:41:52.185 --> 00:41:53.545
I can sleep here with you.

00:41:54.585 --> 00:41:55.825
You'll feel safer.

00:41:57.625 --> 00:41:59.785
And how do you know I can't sleep?

00:42:01.345 --> 00:42:03.545
Your room light is on every night,

00:42:04.145 --> 00:42:05.745
so I figured you couldn't sleep.

00:42:13.785 --> 00:42:14.865
Come on, lie down.

00:42:15.465 --> 00:42:17.105
You can work tomorrow.

00:42:18.345 --> 00:42:19.625
Here you go.

00:42:19.705 --> 00:42:20.945
You've been working so hard.

00:42:35.945 --> 00:42:37.185
I'm not a kid.

00:42:39.345 --> 00:42:40.785
If you're not a kid,

00:42:40.865 --> 00:42:42.185
sleep already.

00:42:44.265 --> 00:42:45.345
Good night.

00:42:51.305 --> 00:42:52.945
You said that like

00:42:53.865 --> 00:42:57.145
sleeping here with you
would make me fall asleep faster.

00:43:16.665 --> 00:43:17.825
Just sleep.

00:43:18.985 --> 00:43:21.625
Nothing will happen tonight.

00:43:23.705 --> 00:43:25.545
Everyone will be safe.

00:43:27.625 --> 00:43:28.665
I promise.

00:43:53.625 --> 00:43:54.785
Inspector.

00:43:58.945 --> 00:44:00.185
Inspector.

00:44:21.825 --> 00:44:23.065
A dinner invitation?

00:44:23.145 --> 00:44:24.305
So that means tonight

00:44:24.385 --> 00:44:26.385
you're going straight into the lion's den,
just like they invited you to?

00:44:26.465 --> 00:44:28.985
I don't know if you're worried
because Seon Jae is one step ahead of us

00:44:29.065 --> 00:44:30.465
or because it's about Captain Jade.

00:44:30.545 --> 00:44:34.945
When I say I'm worried,
I don't say this to just anyone.

00:44:35.025 --> 00:44:38.385
And every time I say it, I mean it.

00:44:40.345 --> 00:44:41.345
You don't have to worry.

00:44:41.425 --> 00:44:43.225
I'll fight every case in your place.

00:44:43.305 --> 00:44:48.345
Before we talk about the case,
what is this between us?
