00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.760
Father.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.790
Escort Young Master Jingxu back to rest.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.960
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.400
You two think you can

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.590
bring me down?

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.590
It is far too early for
such confidence, Old Madam.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.310
Once we find the Fan Scorpion Poison

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.200
and prove you killed Qin Ruoyi,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.710
no clever words will save you then.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.630
What Fan Scorpion Poison?

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.680
I've never even heard of it.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.190
And I didn't kill her.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.030
I have nothing to fear.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.630
Even now, you're still hiding the truth.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.710
Why would I need to hide anything?

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.240
Just the two of you?

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.800
Against me? Such arrogance.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.030
Then what about me?

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.640
You...

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.870
You're awake?

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.590
Brother,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.430
Father has awakened.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.840
Is the case concluded?

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.400
You just woke up.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.520
How do you know?

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.240
Wan'er told me everything.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.630
Master, you've just woken up.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.800
You haven't recovered...

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.640
That's fine.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.870
I've been confined to this sickbed.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.520
I've had quite enough of it.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.310
However,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.150
during all those years of my coma,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.590
I was not entirely unaware.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.560
Today, at the Court of Judicial Review,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.150
you talked your way out of the charges.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.030
Now you've returned to the Marquis Manor,

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.960
I, as the Marquis,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.240
will conduct my own trial.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.080
Zhao Qingru,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.990
kneel.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.190
Kneel!

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.470
You wretch,

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.680
how dare you collude with others

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.280
to harm the descendants of the Li family!

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.190
While I lay in a coma,
you humiliated me again and again.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.870
Every single of these matters,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.630
others may not know,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.800
but I know them all!

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.030
I was left unconscious for so long.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.960
You were the one

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.750
who poisoned me, weren't you?

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.790
It was her!

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.120
Your precious daughter
found the poison for you!

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.150
I did not.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.390
Mother, why do you falsely accuse me?

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.160
I've lived a sheltered life.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.600
How could I know about poisons?

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.920
Besides, Father treats me so kindly.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.000
He cherishes me deeply.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.630
How could I ever harm him?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.560
You deceitful girl!

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.480
I should have ended you!

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.600
Silence!

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.360
You wretch,

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.510
even now,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.600
you're still trying to frame Wan'er!

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.830
Do you think that while I was in a coma,

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.510
I couldn't hear what you said

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.750
or know what you did?

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.800
Open your eyes and look clearly!

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.240
How dare you humiliate me like this!

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.870
If you truly could hear,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.630
then you should know

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.270
why I did what I did!

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.750
We've been married for so many years,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.800
why do you still resent me so deeply?

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.630
Is it all because of Jingchuan and Yan?

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.430
So many years have passed,

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.480
yet you still can't let it go?

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.480
How easily those words escape your lips.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.190
But they've haunted me
every sleepless night!

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.040
Back then, I defied my father's objections

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.680
and insisted on marrying you.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.160
I was a fool to believe you.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.190
You promised me a lifetime of devotion.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.870
But in the end,

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.160
I was the one left behind.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.800
It was all because of that woman!

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.750
We hadn't even been married two years

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.720
when she came straight to
my door with that jerk!

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.160
Everyone in the capital knew.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.430
She turned me into a laughingstock!

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.720
Don't you dare mention my mother.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.520
Who would have known

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.600
that woman died the very next year,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.430
leaving behind her son

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.480
who outshone my own at every turn.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.360
How could I possibly accept that?

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.600
As the matriarch,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.920
you were expected to be magnanimous

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.830
and treat concubines' children kindly.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.950
This title of matriarch

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.430
has weighed on me my whole life!

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.920
Why must I be forgiving?

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.310
Why must I be magnanimous?

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.070
I refuse!

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.240
I want everyone who stand in my son's way

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.800
to die!

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.950
Zhao Qingru.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.510
Zhao Qingru,

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.120
you are no longer fit to be the matriarch.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.480
For your years presiding
over this household,

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.040
you will be told to have
succumbed to a sudden illness.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.120
You'll spend the rest of your days

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.600
in the back courtyard.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.470
No.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.720
Master! Master!

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.800
I can give up the title of matriarch,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.000
but Xu'er...

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.310
Xu'er is your legitimate son.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.190
He must inherit your title.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.310
It must go to Xu'er,

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.830
- not your eldest son!
- Let go!

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.480
I am not dead yet.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.920
I still rule this household!

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.080
No.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.510
Xu'er is your legitimate son.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.480
He must inherit the title.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.080
He must inherit the title.

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:37.550
I'll kill you.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.390
I'll kill you.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.670
- I'll kill you.
- Guards!

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.600
Take her away!

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.550
I'll kill you.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.720
- Take her away!
- Let me go!

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.600
I'll kill you.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.550
My Xu'er is the rightful heir!

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.360
My Xu'er must inherit the title!

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:52.750
I'll kill you.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.570
- My son is the heir!
- Announce her death!

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.080
Wan'er.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:13.960
Father.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.160
Come here.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.750
Sit by my side.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.320
My Wan'er has grown up.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.390
You've become more lovely and graceful.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.720
Thanks for your concern, Father.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.000
During all the years I was in a coma,

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.630
you rarely came to see me.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.960
I feared angering Mother,

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:41.480
so I dared not visit you.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.270
That no longer matters.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.390
That wretch is gone for good.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.960
From now on, you can
stay by my side every day.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.840
My Lady,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.750
you've rubbed it red.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.590
Leave.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.800
- My lady...
- Go!

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.440
Why is it me?

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.600
