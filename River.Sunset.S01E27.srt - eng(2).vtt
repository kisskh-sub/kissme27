WEBVTT

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.959
Boss Geng

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:36.319
Where do we make the move?

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:37.599
There are too many eyes at the hotel.

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:38.560
It's hard to make a move there.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.920
Go and wait on the road.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.040
As soon as those two show up...

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.519
Gun them down.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.159
Understood.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.879
Boss Geng

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.120
I'm taking them now.

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.959
You must succeed.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.799
Failure is not an option.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:06.280
Yes, sir.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.560
Go.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.680
Macau Sakae Agency

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.319
Vice Captain Inoue Kamakura of my unit...

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.199
...died suddenly last night.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.400
Please notify Captain Oshima Hiroshi...

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.879
...to return to base immediately.

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:51.719
Come in.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.080
Sir.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.919
Sanzao Island...

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.280
...6th Air Base...

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.240
...Special Police Battalion sent a telegram.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.520
The Police Battalion Vice Captain...

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.520
...died last night.

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.560
Go to the Lisboa Hotel immediately.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.080
Give this telegram to Oshima.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.560
Yes, sir.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.199
I'm heading to the hotel right now.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.000
Hurry.

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:21.960
That base of theirs...

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.800
...is indeed quite troublesome.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.560
It's almost time.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:01.960
Come in.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.960
Here.

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.520
Captain Oshima.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.360
A telegram for you.

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.639
When was it sent?

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.080
Received just this morning.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.720
What happened?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.120
Inoue is dead.

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:46.160
How is that possible?

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.800
Sasaki.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:50.120
Here.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.160
We're going back immediately.

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:53.959
Yes, sir.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.519
Yamaguchi.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.920
This morning's meeting...

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:58.800
...is cancelled.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.680
We have to rush back.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.360
Please explain to Colonel Sakae...

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.399
...on my behalf.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.519
Please rest assured, sir.

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:07.959
We will do our best.

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:09.720
Let me see you out.

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:10.680
No need.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:12.519
We'll see ourselves out.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.399
Yes.

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:16.519
Let's move, hurry.

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:17.040
Yes, sir.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.759
Oshima Hiroshi.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:39.839
Go.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.920
Let's do this.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.199
Yes.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.639
I need to use the phone.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.360
Hello?

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.000
Get me Boss Sakae.

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:03.199
Yamaguchi.

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:03.680
Yes.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.519
You're back just in time.

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:04.959
The guys from the Eighth District...

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:05.480
...are planning to assassinate Oshima.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.759
Take the Action Squad immediately.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.600
Hurry up!

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.519
Yes, sir.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.600
All Action Squad members!

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.839
Assemble!

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:14.000
Move it!

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.040
Yes, sir!

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.879
Make way!

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:01.600
Stop the car!

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.120
Move, move!

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.319
Something's happened!

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:10.519
Run, hurry!

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:12.199
Stop looking, let's go!

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.320
I'm out of bullets.

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:29.840
I won't take advantage of you.

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:32.480
No one use guns.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.559
Come on out.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.279
These people...

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.200
...are all from Sanzao Island.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.279
Move it.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:14.919
Retreat!

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:20.480
Captain Oshima.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.480
Are you all right?

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:23.120
Quick, first aid kit.

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:24.360
No need.

00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:26.480
Who are they?

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:28.200
They are all people from Anlan Tang.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.120
Rest assured, sir.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.960
I definitely won't let them get away.

00:11:32.279 --> 00:11:33.080
Let me escort you.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.200
No need.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.360
We'll go back on our own.

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:40.639
You guys go, quickly.

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:41.679
I'll hold them off.

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:43.480
Go!

00:11:50.759 --> 00:11:51.759
Halt.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.559
Dad.

00:12:08.679 --> 00:12:09.759
I'm back.

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:11.240
Oh.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.480
We're eating soon.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.000
Okay.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.679
Ju'er.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.159
What are you doing here?

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.399
I've been waiting for you for ages.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Why wait for me?

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:42.480
I have something to tell you.

00:12:45.159 --> 00:12:46.720
I have nothing to say to you.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.039
Ju'er.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.080
What's taking so long?

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:04.960
You stinking brat.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.279
Look at you.

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:08.960
You keep pestering our Ju'er.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.399
How long are you going to keep pestering her?

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.360
What did you say that day?

00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:16.399
If you were a man,

00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:17.799
even if you farted,

00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:19.720
it should make a sound.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.399
Get out!

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:26.240
Not leaving, huh?

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.679
Let me tell you.

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:30.720
Before, out of respect for Master De,

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.360
I gave you face.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.159
I...

00:13:33.159 --> 00:13:34.960
It seems there's no need for that today.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.120
Good.

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:37.399
You stinking brat.

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:38.200
Are you leaving?

00:13:39.159 --> 00:13:39.960
Are you leaving?

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.039
Are you leaving?

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:42.840
Are you leaving?

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:43.840
Are you leaving?

00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:44.600
Are you leaving?

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:46.279
I won't go.

00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:48.000
I won't go.

00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:49.039
Dad!

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:49.919
Stop hitting him!

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.039
What do you want to say?

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:03.840
Say it.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.840
Let's go outside and talk.

00:14:09.879 --> 00:14:11.360
Ju'er, you're not going anywhere.

00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:12.120
Don't go.

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:14.720
What are you doing?

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.159
Dad.

00:14:18.159 --> 00:14:19.600
I'll come back once I make it clear to him.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.399
You...

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.320
Everyone, stand by.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.159
Yes, sir.

00:14:58.639 --> 00:14:59.320
Come in.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.200
How was the matter handled?

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.159
Is Captain Oshima safe?

00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:04.919
Captain Oshima is safe.

00:15:04.919 --> 00:15:05.639
However...

00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:07.279
His assistant suffered minor injuries.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.840
Have they all gone back?

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.080
Don't worry.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.559
They have returned safely.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.639
Yamaguchi-kun.

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:20.039
The attack at the pier...

00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:21.919
It was Rat from Anlan Tang who led the attack.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.080
I know.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.639
The action team is standing by downstairs.

00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:26.519
Should I take some men...

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:27.480
...and bring them back?

00:15:28.039 --> 00:15:29.480
Let them all dismiss and rest.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.759
We received the news in advance this time.

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:34.480
It's thanks to Rat.

00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:36.879
I see.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.600
These Eighth District boys...

00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:41.399
...really aren't easy to deal with.

00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:42.799
Excellency.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.879
Before Captain Oshima left...

00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:46.320
He asked me to tell you...

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:47.679
...about the matter discussed yesterday.

00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:49.320
He asks you to give it your attention.

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:54.480
Captain Oshima is a meticulous man.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.919
It certainly wouldn't be baseless.

00:15:58.159 --> 00:15:59.200
Find a time...

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.039
...to go find Rat.

00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:03.039
Investigate quietly...

00:16:03.039 --> 00:16:05.720
...and find this communication channel.

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:07.039
Yes, sir.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.399
Don't speak of anything else.

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:13.039
Yes, sir.

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:24.759
Ju'er.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.360
Ju'er.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.000
Listen to me.

00:16:36.759 --> 00:16:37.879
Didn't you say...

00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:40.080
...you wouldn't look for me anymore?

00:16:42.679 --> 00:16:43.240
Fine.

00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:46.080
What do you want to say?

00:16:46.759 --> 00:16:47.399
Say it.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:49.879
Ju'er.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.399
Actually, that day...

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.080
...what I said to your father...

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.720
Actually...

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.919
I've liked you since we were little.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.679
You know...

00:16:59.679 --> 00:17:00.960
I'm happy whenever I see you.

00:17:03.679 --> 00:17:05.480
I can do anything for you.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.960
I'd even be willing to die for you.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.319
But yesterday...

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:13.279
...what you said in front of my father...

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.480
...made me understand completely.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.920
You don't care at all...

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.519
...about our engagement.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:25.680
I understand your feelings now.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:27.839
You should go.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:29.480
Don't come looking for me again.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.000
Ju'er, I'm sorry.

00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:32.240
It's all my fault.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:32.839
I was wrong.

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:33.599
I was being a fool.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.759
And I kept putting you in danger time and again.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.480
All of this is my fault.

00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:39.400
You don't need to say sorry to me.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.279
And I don't need your apology.

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:43.920
Nor do I regret...

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.720
...helping you and Ying'er do those things.

00:17:47.279 --> 00:17:48.400
I am a Chinese.

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:50.519
A person of Sanzao Island.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.119
I also understand the national cause.

00:17:53.599 --> 00:17:54.799
Right from wrong.

00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:57.480
My father might...

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.680
...to save my life...

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.559
...go and work for the Japanese.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.119
But I can also, to drive out the Japanese...

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:07.119
...give up my life.

00:18:11.519 --> 00:18:12.160
Ju'er.

00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:14.400
You did it all.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.039
You did very well.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.759
Everyone dies sooner or later.

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:22.759
But until yesterday...

00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:24.839
...I didn't realize...

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.200
...that death was so close to me.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:30.839
Ju'er.

00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:33.519
Let's forget about those demons.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.160
Let's try to forget...

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.599
...everything else, okay?

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:41.920
Before a person dies

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.079
is there a sign?

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:48.240
In another world

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:50.960
calling out to another person

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.839
will he hear it?

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.119
Ju'er, listen to me

00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:03.759
Our loneliest

00:19:03.759 --> 00:19:04.880
and hardest days

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.079
are already past

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.200
Hold on

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:08.480
We must have

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.880
the courage to live on

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.799
Brother Longxia

00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:15.599
I know

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.559
you have a restless heart

00:19:20.599 --> 00:19:22.200
As long as you leave this island

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.319
your dreams can set sail

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.599
Those Japanese

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:29.759
and that police brigade

00:19:29.759 --> 00:19:31.599
mean nothing to you

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.319
But that's not what I want

00:19:37.519 --> 00:19:39.559
I just want a simple life

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.480
a shoulder I can rely on

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.759
hoping for a small home

00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:54.920
Ju'er

00:19:56.599 --> 00:19:57.880
In my life

00:19:58.279 --> 00:20:00.279
two things have made me happiest

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:01.799
The first thing is

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.559
when I was three years old

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.839
the Ye parents adopted me

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.480
and gave me a home

00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:10.720
The second thing is

00:20:11.759 --> 00:20:12.920
that I was able to meet you

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.759
You let me know that in this world

00:20:14.759 --> 00:20:16.079
there is such a woman

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.160
who isn't afraid to die for me

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.839
and isn't afraid of a hard life

00:20:22.359 --> 00:20:24.240
I know what you're still worried about

00:20:24.759 --> 00:20:26.119
You're afraid our relationship

00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:28.200
won't be blessed by your dad, right?

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.559
Actually, it's not easy for your dad either

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.559
He does all this for you

00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:38.759
I just don't like his status

00:20:39.079 --> 00:20:41.000
and how he acts in front of the Japanese

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.720
that groveling attitude of his

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.559
But I can't change him

00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:49.759
As long as I marry you

00:20:49.759 --> 00:20:51.200
then your dad is my dad

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.480
I can make him change

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.519
As long as he doesn't help the Japs do evil

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:55.960
I can tolerate everything else

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.319
What did you

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.640
just say?

00:21:03.119 --> 00:21:03.960
Ju'er

00:21:04.599 --> 00:21:05.920
I will definitely marry you

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.119
I've waited for those words

00:21:19.359 --> 00:21:20.519
It seems

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.799
seems like I've waited a lifetime

00:21:38.759 --> 00:21:39.480
Look

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.200
Over there

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.720
Great

00:21:46.599 --> 00:21:47.359
Let's go

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:51.359
What's there to be happy about?

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.519
Lovers finally together

00:21:53.519 --> 00:21:55.079
Of course I'm happy

00:21:56.039 --> 00:21:57.480
Having feelings isn't necessarily good

00:21:58.079 --> 00:21:59.240
It adds a worry

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.880
and adds a danger

00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:03.839
I actually think that in troubled times

00:22:04.119 --> 00:22:04.880
feelings

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.519
are what keep them close together

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.799
Having someone to love

00:22:08.279 --> 00:22:09.599
makes one live with more strength

00:22:09.599 --> 00:22:10.400
more bravery

00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:12.359
and more hope

00:22:14.359 --> 00:22:15.680
From another angle

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.720
it also makes them more afraid

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.480
Afraid of losing everything they have

00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:23.119
Making them, when facing things

00:22:23.519 --> 00:22:24.559
become weak

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.799
become panicked

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.640
Making them, because of this hopeless fate

00:22:29.079 --> 00:22:30.400
live in even greater despair

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.799
I can't argue with you

00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:33.720
But I think

00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:36.480
love is humanity's greatest emotion

00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:38.519
It is the most

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.079
amazing thing in this world

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:41.559
Look

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.039
At least right now they are

00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:45.759
the happiest people in the world

00:22:45.759 --> 00:22:46.759
Aren't they?

00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:52.400
Wumu Ichiro

00:22:53.359 --> 00:22:54.960
do you have no love in your heart?

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.640
If what you're talking about

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.039
is just that thing between men and women

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.720
I'm glad that I don't

00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:01.079
Glad?

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:02.359
That's quite pathetic

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.680
Dad

00:23:21.119 --> 00:23:22.359
Whatever we do,

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:24.599
shouldn't we respect life?

00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:26.279
Yes.

00:23:27.319 --> 00:23:29.359
Then saving people knows no borders, right?

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.200
It doesn't.

00:23:32.839 --> 00:23:35.039
So being a nurse in a Japanese hospital,

00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:36.880
that counts as saving lives too.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.960
Don't you think?

00:23:41.359 --> 00:23:42.119
Yes.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.519
Then being a nurse in a Japanese hospital

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:50.119
wouldn't tarnish your reputation, right?

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.720
It wouldn't.

00:23:54.519 --> 00:23:55.279
But being the Maintenance Association President would.

00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:56.319
But being the Maintenance Association President would.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.359
Dad.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.759
You understand everything.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.160
You said it so clearly,

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:08.920
so directly.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.839
How could I not understand?

00:24:11.079 --> 00:24:12.279
What do you want to say?

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.960
I...

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.519
Think before you speak.

00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:34.279
I want to marry her.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.799
Dad.

00:24:45.799 --> 00:24:47.200
I want to marry Ju'er.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.319
Do you agree?

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.720
Xia'er.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.839
These past few years

00:25:03.839 --> 00:25:06.079
have been the darkest days on the island.

00:25:07.599 --> 00:25:09.480
Only when you are with Ju'er

00:25:10.119 --> 00:25:11.839
are your happiest days.

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:15.079
Now,

00:25:16.079 --> 00:25:17.599
as long as you've thought it through

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.000
and go do it,

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:21.880
I will naturally respect your choice.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:33.920
Thank you, Dad.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.119
Good.

00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:40.599
Go have a chat with your mom.

00:25:40.759 --> 00:25:41.519
Okay.

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:43.400
Here.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.079
There.

00:25:44.079 --> 00:25:45.240
Where are you running to?

00:26:10.119 --> 00:26:11.079
Mom.

00:26:11.079 --> 00:26:12.599
I want to marry Ju'er.

00:26:13.319 --> 00:26:14.920
Can you give me your blessing?

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.400
De Gong!

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.480
Good news!

00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:42.920
De Gong, De Gong!

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:45.599
What is it?

00:26:45.599 --> 00:26:46.480
Why so excited?

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.519
This time it's really great news.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.279
Since the Japanese came to the island,

00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:54.000
what great news could there be?

00:26:56.039 --> 00:26:57.039
The Japanese...

00:26:57.119 --> 00:26:58.359
aren't they setting up some...

00:26:58.359 --> 00:26:59.559
Maintenance Association?

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.880
The President of that Maintenance Association,

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.039
they let me be it!

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.720
Look.

00:27:06.759 --> 00:27:09.519
Our Ju'er and Xia'er's wedding date,

00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:11.000
can go ahead as planned!

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.279
From now on, the Japanese

00:27:13.519 --> 00:27:14.759
won't touch our two families.

00:27:16.599 --> 00:27:17.400
Maybe,

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.119
they'll even protect us.

00:27:27.839 --> 00:27:28.960
With the nation in crisis,

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.400
every man has a duty.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.359
Alas, I am old.

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:37.359
Powerless to drive the jackals and tigers from our China.

00:27:38.599 --> 00:27:39.559
Whenever I think of this,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.359
I feel deeply ashamed.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.839
I have but one breath left.

00:27:45.839 --> 00:27:47.200
All I can do is

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.079
stand tall with a straight back,

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.920
and not disgrace the loyal souls of my Sanzao clansmen.

00:27:56.039 --> 00:27:57.119
Bingchen.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:58.920
No.

00:28:00.039 --> 00:28:01.920
I should call you President Tang.

00:28:04.119 --> 00:28:05.039
You and I...

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.720
Our paths diverge; we cannot work together.

00:28:06.839 --> 00:28:07.880
From now on,

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.400
let us go our separate ways.

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:11.839
No...

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.880
De Gong...

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.960
The engagement between the two children...

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.240
The engagement?

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.559
From this day on, mention it no more.

00:28:21.359 --> 00:28:21.960
No!

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:44.920
Captain

00:28:46.359 --> 00:28:47.000
Captain Oshima

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:47.920
How did you get injured?

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:48.839
Don't worry about that.

00:28:48.839 --> 00:28:49.680
What's the situation on your end?

00:28:50.519 --> 00:28:51.079
It looks like a car accident.

00:28:51.079 --> 00:28:51.880
Is the scene still preserved?

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:52.680
We didn't dare touch the scene.

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:53.559
We have men guarding it.

00:28:53.559 --> 00:28:54.279
Waiting for your return.

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:54.960
Sasaki

00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:55.759
You go to the hospital first.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.279
Take him to the hospital.

00:28:58.279 --> 00:28:59.000
Yes, sir.

00:28:59.839 --> 00:29:00.400
Good work.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.480
Even dogs don't come to this place.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.839
What was he doing here?

00:29:18.359 --> 00:29:19.400
I don't know.

00:29:20.079 --> 00:29:21.359
Did Vice Captain Inoue drink too much again?

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:22.799
And drove all the way here?

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.599
Captain.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.880
You're finally here.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.160
Captain.

00:29:50.839 --> 00:29:52.240
You don't look well.

00:29:53.119 --> 00:29:54.599
Maybe you shouldn't go down there.

00:29:54.599 --> 00:29:55.480
Move.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.200
Captain.

00:30:16.839 --> 00:30:17.920
Burned like this, can we be sure it's Inoue?

00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:18.920
Confirmed.

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:21.039
The clothes are basically all burned off.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.319
His ID was pressed under his body.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.799
Hey, where's the ID?

00:30:29.119 --> 00:30:30.759
Only this bit is left after the fire.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.559
The license plate number is correct.

00:30:34.079 --> 00:30:38.319
It's almost certainly Vice Captain Inoue.

00:30:40.079 --> 00:30:41.039
Have you surveyed the surrounding area?

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.039
Any findings?

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.839
We have.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.039
The road up the mountain is all stone.

00:30:46.039 --> 00:30:47.960
No traces were left.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.720
We conducted a thorough search of the surroundings.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.920
And found nothing.

00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:52.319
Hey.

00:30:54.839 --> 00:30:55.680
Captain.

00:30:57.079 --> 00:30:58.480
Can we determine if Vice Captain Inoue...

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.920
...died after falling here...

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:01.160
...or was moved down here after death?

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.839
That requires an autopsy.

00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:04.000
If Captain Inoue...

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.480
...fell off the cliff after death...

00:31:06.519 --> 00:31:08.400
...and the motorcycle caught fire afterwards...

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.000
...then his organs and chest cavity...

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.920
...would definitely not have inhaled smoke.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.519
Can the time of death be determined?

00:31:14.359 --> 00:31:15.599
That can also be determined.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.599
All right then.

00:31:18.359 --> 00:31:19.720
Take the body back for an autopsy.

00:31:20.119 --> 00:31:21.480
Get everything clear for me.

00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:22.559
Yes, we'll do our best.

00:31:25.359 --> 00:31:26.480
My intuition tells me...

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.880
...this was no accident.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.079
Sasaki.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:55.960
Yes, sir.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.039
How is your injury?

00:31:57.039 --> 00:31:58.400
Do you need to rest a bit?

00:32:00.119 --> 00:32:01.000
It's nothing.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.480
Captain.

00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:15.119
Don't be too sad.

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:18.000
Mmh.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.480
Sasaki.

00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:23.559
Do you think Inoue...

00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:24.839
...had a traffic accident?

00:32:26.039 --> 00:32:27.119
Like hell I believe that.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.160
These past few days...

00:32:30.319 --> 00:32:31.799
...we've encountered too many things.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.079
If it wasn't a traffic accident...

00:32:36.039 --> 00:32:37.920
...there must be a primary crime scene.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.920
Where is this primary scene?

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.680
I don't think that's hard.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.480
As long as we investigate Inoue's...

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.680
...activities yesterday...

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.480
...and follow his route...

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.400
...we should be able to find the scene.

00:32:55.319 --> 00:32:57.759
Then let's wait for the doctor's conclusion.

00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:11.640
The eyes belong to Fire

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.640
The mouth and ears belong to Water

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.960
The nose belongs to Earth

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.599
The forehead belongs to Wood

00:33:19.319 --> 00:33:21.200
Your eyes reveal a fierce light

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:22.720
Your internal fire is too strong

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.960
You will surely meet disaster by fire

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.000
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:32.559
That old fortune teller was actually quite accurate

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:35.480
There really was a disaster

00:33:36.759 --> 00:33:38.359
And it was a fire disaster

00:33:38.359 --> 00:33:39.359
What are you muttering about?

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.160
Do you remember?

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:46.279
The old fortune teller we arrested last time

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.759
When he saw Captain Inoue, he said

00:33:48.759 --> 00:33:50.160
Captain Inoue's forehead was dark

00:33:50.599 --> 00:33:52.240
Predicting an unforeseen disaster

00:33:53.119 --> 00:33:57.640
He also said the fire in his eyes was too strong

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.279
And that he would die by fire

00:34:02.599 --> 00:34:03.400
We just thought he was talking nonsense then

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.000
I didn't expect him to be so accurate

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:04.799
Sasaki

00:34:07.319 --> 00:34:08.159
As a soldier of the Empire

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:09.199
How can you believe the Chinese?

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.360
Believe in these

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.159
Absurd and baseless superstitious remarks

00:34:13.519 --> 00:34:14.599
I was foolish, sir

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:16.840
Besides

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.840
We still can't be sure

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.400
How exactly Inoue died

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.159
You are right

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.480
That old fortune teller

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.039
Where is he now?

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.000
He is still locked up by us

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.239
Oh

00:34:38.079 --> 00:34:38.800
I actually

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.840
Forgot about this person

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.599
That jerk

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:44.280
How dare he curse my subordinate

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.159
Spreading rumors to confuse the public

00:34:49.039 --> 00:34:51.039
I won't let him see tomorrow's sun

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.039
Are the results out?

00:34:56.039 --> 00:34:57.679
What exactly happened?

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.480
How exactly did Vice Captain Inoue die?

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:00.199
Captain

00:35:02.719 --> 00:35:03.679
What's the situation?

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.360
Preliminary conclusion

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.480
Vice Captain Inoue's time of death

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.599
Was probably around 4 or 5 PM yesterday

00:35:10.199 --> 00:35:11.880
He drank alcohol before he died

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.880
In his gastric fluid

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.599
We found traces of alcohol

00:35:14.599 --> 00:35:15.840
After opening the trachea, we didn't find

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.800
Any signs of inhaling smoke or dust

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.559
So Vice Captain Inoue

00:35:19.559 --> 00:35:20.960
Before the motorcycle caught fire

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.559
Was already dead

00:35:22.639 --> 00:35:24.039
So Inoue was killed by someone first?

00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:26.119
We can't say that yet

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.239
What is the true cause of death?

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.079
Asphyxiation caused by a broken neck

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.480
His neck was broken

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:32.800
Neck broken?

00:35:34.239 --> 00:35:35.599
You mean the neck broke from the fall?

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.920
After the motorcycle fell off the cliff

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.480
If Captain Inoue's neck hit the ground first

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.800
It could have caused the neck to break

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.920
Leading to asphyxiation

00:35:43.559 --> 00:35:44.880
The motorcycle might have

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.039
Caught fire afterwards

00:35:46.039 --> 00:35:47.760
But at least before the motorcycle caught fire

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.199
The Captain had already stopped breathing

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.719
So, is this a murder?

00:35:53.039 --> 00:35:54.360
We can't say that either

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.559
Were there any gunshot wounds found on him?

00:35:56.559 --> 00:35:57.480
Or knife wounds?

00:35:58.079 --> 00:35:58.880
No

00:35:59.199 --> 00:36:00.119
But Dr. Ozu said

00:36:00.239 --> 00:36:02.000
When he came to the hospital before

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.159
He was treated for a bite wound

00:36:03.159 --> 00:36:04.280
On his arm

00:36:06.519 --> 00:36:07.239
A bite wound?

00:36:08.159 --> 00:36:08.960
Who bit him?

00:36:10.119 --> 00:36:10.960
I don't know

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.480
Pass down the order

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.880
I require the military hospital

00:36:17.039 --> 00:36:18.239
All staff members

00:36:18.239 --> 00:36:19.719
To return to their posts immediately

00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:20.519
Yes, sir

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.480
You men

00:36:26.679 --> 00:36:28.039
Investigate the following details thoroughly

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.239
At what time did Inoue

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.519
Arrive at the military hospital?

00:36:30.519 --> 00:36:31.800
What time did he leave?

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.119
Who did he interact with at the hospital?

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.119
What did he do?

00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:36.400
What did he say?

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.400
Don't miss a single detail

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.119
Get clear answers for everything

00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:41.000
Yes, sir

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.159
Nurse Tang,

00:38:05.679 --> 00:38:07.519
you have two words written on your face:

00:38:09.079 --> 00:38:10.159
"Arrest me."

00:38:13.199 --> 00:38:15.199
Why haven't Biying and Wumu arrived yet?

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:19.000
If they were to

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.800
appear at the hospital right now,

00:38:21.039 --> 00:38:22.519
it would be like admitting

00:38:22.519 --> 00:38:24.239
that they are involved in this matter.

00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:26.320
Do you understand?

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.880
Aren't you worried at all?

00:38:29.199 --> 00:38:30.719
Does worrying help?

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.519
If they trace it back to here,

00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:38.800
we might lose our lives.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.639
Are you not afraid at all?

00:38:40.639 --> 00:38:43.000
Fear can't help us right now.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.039
Nurse Tang,

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.159
what you need now is to take a deep breath.

00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:50.800
Calm down.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.639
Think of the people we love.

00:38:55.079 --> 00:38:56.840
For our beliefs.

00:38:57.599 --> 00:38:58.840
Don't be afraid.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.239
You are a brave girl.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.400
God will protect us.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.400
Everything will be fine.

00:39:38.519 --> 00:39:39.519
Take a few men

00:39:39.519 --> 00:39:40.480
and execute that old fortune teller.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:41.760
Do it now?

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.639
Immediately.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.320
Yes, sir.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.559
Captain, you wanted to see me?

00:40:10.039 --> 00:40:11.280
Regarding Vice Captain Inoue,

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.280
how should we notify his father, Akira Inoue?

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.559
Inoue

00:40:17.159 --> 00:40:18.480
died a horrible death.

00:40:19.599 --> 00:40:22.719
The body is beyond recognition.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.480
Telling Akira Inoue the truth

00:40:26.239 --> 00:40:28.079
is probably not a good idea.

00:40:29.719 --> 00:40:30.920
I have a feeling

00:40:33.199 --> 00:40:35.360
that there is definitely something wrong here.

00:40:36.639 --> 00:40:38.039
What exactly is going on?

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.800
I am truly

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.480
unconvinced.

00:40:49.519 --> 00:40:50.000
Sasaki.

00:40:50.599 --> 00:40:50.960
Here.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.639
Secretly investigate two things for me.

00:41:00.039 --> 00:41:00.679
First,

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.079
on the day of Inoue's accident,

00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:06.800
check all of Colonel Wumu's activities.

00:41:08.159 --> 00:41:09.079
Second,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.199
investigate all of Inoue's activities that day.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.239
I want to see if their activities

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:16.559
had any intersection.

00:41:17.719 --> 00:41:18.320
If

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.400
it matches the time

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.719
of Inoue's death,

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.599
then everything will be clear.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.360
I'll organize a team immediately

00:41:33.199 --> 00:41:34.400
to investigate these two matters.

00:41:35.119 --> 00:41:36.159
Also,

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.880
send Mr. Akira Inoue

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.480
a telegram.

00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:44.519
Understood.

00:41:46.039 --> 00:41:46.800
During an enemy

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.079
attack on the 6th Air Base,

00:41:50.119 --> 00:41:51.480
Vice Captain Kamakura Inoue

00:41:52.719 --> 00:41:56.480
fought bravely

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:03.280
and was killed in action.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.719
All right, understood.
