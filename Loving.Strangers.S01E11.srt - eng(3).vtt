from when he was little.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.420
And we've got a soccer team too.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.250
Ding Zhe,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.380
our team's Tony Leung.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.140
Quit it!

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:22.860
Fei,

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.660
a chubby guy.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.220
I'm the captain, Chi.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.810
Shortest guy, best drinker!

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:27.980
Oh, shut it for a second.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.530
This place is Ms. Dan's.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.420
Everyone calls her Ms. Dan.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.220
What "Ms. Dan"?

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.900
You're making me sound old.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.290
I'm Chu Dan, the owner here.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:36.140
Welcome.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.290
Come on, let's all have a drink.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.420
Welcome!

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.050
- Welcome! - Welcome!

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:45.980
Enjoy. I'm going back to work.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.660
So tell us.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.730
How did you two meet?

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.730
I acted in Director Jiang's film before.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.770
Director Jiang even won awards,

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:56.700
you all know that, right?

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.980
Can you not bring that up here?

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.620
That short film was seriously brilliant!

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.380
After I watched it back then,

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.810
I swear, even in my dreams,

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.220
I wanted to be in his movie.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.050
Then a month later,

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:10.490
my agent called me

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.050
and asked me to play the female lead

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.250
in Director Jiang's new film!

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.620
I'm telling you,

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.140
I was over the moon!

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.980
Every day I obsessed over the script.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.220
And then...

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:21.980
first day of shooting, I was stunned.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.620
One scene of mine

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.570
was shot dozens of times,

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.290
and it still didn't pass.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:30.380
In the end, Director Jiang told me

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.250
to use my eyes

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.380
to scream without making a sound.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.770
Chi, hey.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.730
Look!

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.620
You all think that's weird, right?

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.810
Director Jiang had

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:55.660
a lot of weird ideas.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.660
Every day I kept thinking,

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:58.980
what did he even mean?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.250
And then...

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.250
the more I thought,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.700
the less I got it,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.290
the worse I acted.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:07.810
It got to the point where

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:09.620
the moment I stood in front of the camera,

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:10.980
he'd frown.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:12.530
And once he frowned,

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:13.770
I'd fall apart.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.900
After about...

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:17.770
a month of shooting,

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.620
I developed this problem.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.220
The second I see a camera,

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:21.980
I get scared.

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.010
Oh...

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.050
this hasn't gone away.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.420
So I didn't dare take roles anymore.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.860
Jialu, that's on you!

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.220
How could you treat her like that?

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.220
She couldn't act to begin with!

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.090
He said that about me too.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:37.700
He ruined my confidence.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.420
But I noticed

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.700
you're still happy

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.140
to see him.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.050
Because a director hauling cargo in a van

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.940
is just too cute!

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:50.860
For a while,

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.290
I thought it was my problem.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.620
But seeing the director

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.140
turn out like this,

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.380
maybe the problem was him,

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.420
not me.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.660
If the director

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.660
made a blockbuster now,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.290
I'd cry my eyes out.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.530
Thank you, Director.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.530
Thanks for making your life so pathetic.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.940
Jialu!

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.570
Hello?

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:26.940
Where are you?

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.010
Out.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.490
About that biotech company

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:35.770
you mentioned last time,

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:37.940
do you have any info?

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.530
Why ask all of a sudden?

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.090
Just want to take a look.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.090
[Unknown number]

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.010
I still have something

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:46.660
to finish.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.180
I'll give it to you when I get home.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:53.620
Hello?

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:55.090
Anything else?

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.860
No.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:29.250
Hello, who is this?

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.620
Sorry, wrong number.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:57.530
Come on, kick it!

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:01.090
Dongshan,

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:03.900
can you be a little more ambitious?

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.010
Every time before we play,

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.490
you only think about the drinking after.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.180
Can we not drink?

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:11.570
Oh, come on.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:12.940
If you keep this up,

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:14.090
this team's done.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.570
Isn't soccer just for

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:16.290
that post-game drink?

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:18.180
What's with you, Chi?

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:18.940
I got a cramp!

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.900
Who can sub in for me?

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.570
Oh!

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.980
Look...

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:23.730
you're getting old, huh?

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.050
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.090
You want eight of us

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.730
against nine of them?

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.050
We've lost five straight.

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.490
Lose again and no one will play us!

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.900
Jialu, sub in for me.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:33.220
I can't. Not today.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:34.330
Stop pretending. Hurry!

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.530
Harder.

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.860
My brother's here.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.660
Let my brother play.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.730
Jiaqi, hurry, sub in for me!

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:41.010
How is it?

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:41.980
Yeah, harder.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:44.940
Feeling better?

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:45.530
Yeah.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.730
Much better.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:54.330
Go!

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.250
Charge!

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:58.730
Nice shot!

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.460
You can't stop him!

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.900
Nice!

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.180
This way!

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:09.320
Fall back!

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.940
Nice shot!

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.900
National Day break is coming up.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.490
And add some annual leave,

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:23.980
we can take An

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.250
to Iceland to see the northern lights.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.180
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.810
Don't you care?

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:31.900
Well,

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.810
I was going to take Mom out for a trip.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.530
Then bring Mom with us.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:38.700
She's scared of flying,

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:39.810
and she worries we'll spend a lot.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:40.810
How would she agree?

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:43.420
Then what do we do?

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.010
How about we just travel around here?

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.730
It'll be lively with everyone together.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.660
Honey,

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.490
just take me and An with you.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:53.250
Let's go a bit farther

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.570
and see some different sights.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.420
Next year.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:32:59.810
Next year, only the three of us.

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.010
Next year...

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:05.490
How many times have you said that?

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:07.420
Forget it.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:08.980
I'll take An myself.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:13.730
Keep up!

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:14.420
Stay on him!

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:22.140
I'm back.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:23.860
What time is it?

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:26.250
Didn't you say you'd be home by noon?

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:28.810
You only get one weekend a week,

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.010
and you still forgot?

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.770
Chi's son

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:34.010
got his acceptance letter,

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.730
so he dragged us out to celebrate.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.660
First Chi,

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.570
then your uncle...

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:38.980
It's always something.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.250
I just played some soccer.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.180
Do you have to be like this?

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.220
Yes!

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.090
I do!

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:47.940
When we were moving houses,

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.140
I told you,

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.180
it should be closer to your office

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.420
or closer to mine.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.290
But you insisted on this area.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.940
And now that we're here,

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.700
you're always

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.810
with them.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.810
If it's not drinking, it's soccer.

00:33:59.030 --> 00:33:59.530
Can your world

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:00.860
ever get beyond this neighborhood?

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:02.840
Look at our classmates,
