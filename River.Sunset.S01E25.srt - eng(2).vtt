00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:47.040
Colonel

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.000
How should we report to

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.760
Commander Fujita?

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.359
This is my squadron's

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.879
biggest battle

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.040
since entering the war.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.759
Although

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.199
there were some losses,

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.479
we successfully repelled the enemy,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.560
ensured Your Excellency's safety,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.800
and successfully completed

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.680
the re-investigation of the crash site.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.840
Commander Fujita should reward

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.599
our squadron for its heroic performance

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.599
in this battle.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.080
I think the two of you

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.520
look better in uniform.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.680
Let's go to headquarters first.

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:14.719
Is it possible that the enemy

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.560
was prepared in advance?

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:19.840
I have considered that possibility.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.560
But if

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.159
they were lying in ambush there,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.319
why did they open fire

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.400
before we even

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.000
arrived at the scene?

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.159
However, Commander,

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.240
thanks to Captain Oshima

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.840
arriving in time with his men,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.919
otherwise the consequences would be unthinkable.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.360
How did Oshima Hiroshi know

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.919
that you would be attacked?

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.199
On that point,

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:41.879
I am not very clear either.

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.759
By the way, regarding the investigation...

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.319
I will take my leave now.

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.000
I will wait outside for the Colonel.

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:15.360
Huh?

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.759
Isn't that the Colonel's car?

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.639
Is the Colonel at headquarters too?

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.639
I'm afraid so.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.959
You wait outside for a while.

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:25.839
I'll go in by myself.

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:26.480
Yes, sir.

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.000
To be honest, Commander,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.560
as soon as Captain Oshima Hiroshi returned to the island,

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:33.839
he has been suspicious

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:35.079
of my female assistant's identity.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.079
He has warned me repeatedly

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.199
and often sends people

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.959
to follow Miss Ye Biying and me.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.120
Is that so?

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:45.040
He is being overly suspicious.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.279
Has it caused you any trouble?

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:48.720
I wouldn't call it trouble,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.959
but I just don't like the feeling

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:51.319
of being watched.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.839
That is truly excessive.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.839
Normally, this time,

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:57.480
knowing that I came to the island

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.480
to investigate the crash

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.839
of Admiral Osumi Mineo,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
he should fully cooperate with my work.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.639
This fellow...

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.040
has been acting a bit strangely lately.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.759
But maybe I'm overthinking it.

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.560
I've long heard that Captain Oshima

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.160
is a man who goes his own way.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.800
And he's not interested in politics.

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:14.600
Besides,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.800
when Admiral Osumi Mineo crashed,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.000
he wasn't on the island.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.720
No...

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:19.319
It was after Admiral Osumi Mineo's accident

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.879
that he left Sanzao Island.

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:25.560
But Captain Oshima told me personally...

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.319
What did he say?

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.120
Nothing.

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.759
I might have remembered it wrong.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.920
Is Commander Fujita in?

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.639
Yes, please wait a moment.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:38.839
Captain Oshima.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.480
Adjutant Sakamoto.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.360
Yes.

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.199
Why are you dressed like that today?

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.120
Does it fit well?

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:51.319
I have some business with the Commander today.

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:52.519
But right now, the Commander

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:53.560
is listening to the Colonel's report

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.879
on yesterday's battle at Mount Huangyang.

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:56.720
Is that so?

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.000
Please go in.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.639
No need.

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:59.600
That won't be necessary.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.920
I'll go back for now.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.720
Is that alright?

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.279
It's fine.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.920
I'm quite busy today.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.879
I'll visit another time.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.920
Let's go

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.160
Let's head back to the airport camp first

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.000
All right

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.879
Excellency, did you call for me?

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.240
Has the Colonel gone back?

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:48.160
He's gone

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:49.879
Captain Oshima was just here

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:52.959
He said there was some urgent mission

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.319
And left in a hurry again

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:57.199
He's always in a rush all day long

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.480
I don't know what he's up to

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:01.319
Arrange for the Base Intelligence Section

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.199
to secretly investigate Oshima Hiroshi

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.480
We must figure out this man

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.399
and his connection with the high-ranking officers

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:07.560
of the Control Faction back home

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.480
I must rule out the possibility of his involvement

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.000
in the assassination of Admiral Osumi Mineo

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.199
Yes, sir

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.759
This investigation

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.720
is classified as top secret

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:20.360
I understand

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.000
I will take my leave now

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.120
This boat belongs to the Fukuda Fukudai Company

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.519
They often use this boat

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:03.199
to go to Macau, China and Hong Kong, China to purchase supplies

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.040
Inoue

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:07.560
You go back

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.240
We'll be back in two or three days at most

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:11.519
Manage the team well and don't let any trouble occur

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:12.959
Don't worry

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.519
Oshima

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:54.759
You drive the car back first

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.080
I still have some things to do

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.559
Yes

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:15.759
Mitchell

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:17.080
I want to ask you a favor

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:18.120
What favor?

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:20.200
I need the pilot of plane number 16

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.120
Thank you

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.519
I want to keep your Lieutenant Miller

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:23.759
here to participate in this operation

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.039
Although he is one of my Navy pilots

00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:29.879
he also participated in the joint operation with the Army

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:32.080
It's up to you, Jimmy

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:36.840
Miller

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.960
How are our Army pilots doing?

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.600
Can they become qualified sailors?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.159
Just about, sir

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:45.559
If my carrier cannot provide

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:47.679
a wind speed of 49 knots

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:49.840
can you take off?

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.519
Even if we sail against the wind

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:53.720
we still need 150 yards to take off

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.639
Counting the 16th plane

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:58.200
there is currently 160 yards of runway space left

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.000
So, sir

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.840
no problem

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.960
When do you want me to demonstrate the takeoff?

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.320
I don't think a demonstration is needed

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.600
I need you to stay

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.919
and work with us

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:17.679
Captain

00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:19.399
The Navy won't demote me

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:21.200
for participating in an Army mission, right?

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.080
If this mission is successful

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.759
they will promote you

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.879
Miller became the last pilot

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:32.279
to join the Doolittle Squadron raid mission

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.639
Years later

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:35.840
Mitchell's joke came true

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.080
He was awarded the rank of Major General

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:44.000
You guys really have to taste this ice cream

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.000
We are already on the Hornet,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.279
sailing for a day.

00:10:57.039 --> 00:10:58.200
Barring any surprises,

00:10:59.039 --> 00:11:00.559
we take off on the 19th

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:04.240
to show the Navy our operation.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.679
All right, all right.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.799
Sir, we take off on the 19th.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:09.720
To where?

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.759
I can't tell you that right now.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.559
Sir.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.960
Everyone wants to solve the mystery.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.840
Can you give us a clue?

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.919
Is it Japan or the Philippines?

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.960
You only need to focus on two things right now.

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:24.240
Keeping our planes

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.480
in combat-ready condition.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.559
And learning.

00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:27.480
Learning?

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:28.600
Yes.

00:11:29.159 --> 00:11:32.080
I've invited two Navy colleagues

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.480
to be your teachers.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.480
Commander, Major, please come here.

00:11:40.039 --> 00:11:41.840
Major Stephen Jurika.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.840
From 1939 to 1941,

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.120
he served as Naval Attaché at the embassy in Japan.

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:50.200
He is a Japan expert.

00:11:50.759 --> 00:11:52.840
He will explain Japan's history,

00:11:53.159 --> 00:11:54.879
political concepts, and culture to us.

00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:56.080
No.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.720
This doesn't mean we're going to Japan.

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:02.120
This is so you can better understand

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.559
our enemy.

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:07.679
To defeat your enemy,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.559
you must first understand him.

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:14.399
Commander Apollo Soucek.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.480
The Hornet's Executive Officer.

00:12:17.799 --> 00:12:19.960
He has been to China many times.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.080
He will teach you some basic Chinese

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.559
so we can communicate with our allies there.

00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:27.159
This could save your lives.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.480
Commander, if you please.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.480
"I am an American."

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:37.080
That is Chinese for "I am an American."

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:38.840
Cole.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.000
You give it a try.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.960
"I am an American."

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.960
Did you understand what he meant?

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.240
You surely understood, right?

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.480
I think we can handle it.

00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:08.200
"I am an American."

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.200
Fukuda.

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:24.600
Fukuda!

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.679
Vice-Captain Inoue.

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:27.720
Why are you so free today,

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.600
to come visit my place?

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:31.720
Hurry and get me wine and women.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.480
Wine and women?

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.799
Go get the wine ready, quickly.

00:13:33.799 --> 00:13:34.279
Yes, yes.

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:34.720
Women...

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.679
Who is available to come over?

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.120
We'll prepare immediately.

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:39.080
Hurry.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.120
Hurry and call her over.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:40.559
Yes.

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:41.879
Go prepare quickly.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.360
Hurry up.

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:54.759
Bring me wine and food.

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:55.799
Be quick.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:11.759
Vice-Captain Inoue

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:13.600
You look very happy today

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.080
That's right

00:14:14.799 --> 00:14:15.919
You bet

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.919
The Captain and Sasaki are both gone

00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:21.399
Now there's no one on the island to boss me around

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.039
That is wonderful

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:23.879
Oh, you knew?

00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:24.480
I know about it

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.240
They took my boat

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.399
Oh, right

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:28.480
Fukuda

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.679
You must be exhausted

00:14:29.679 --> 00:14:31.360
I've been worked to death lately too

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.200
You have no idea

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.559
That Oshima

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:34.919
I don't know what's gotten into him

00:14:34.919 --> 00:14:37.080
He's becoming more and more active

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.639
That missing soldier from the garrison

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:42.279
Hasn't been found yet?

00:14:42.559 --> 00:14:44.080
I reckon that guy

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.000
Was snatched by those triads in Macau

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.399
Or he ran into

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:49.759
Someone he shouldn't have

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:51.879
Let's not talk about this

00:14:51.879 --> 00:14:53.120
Hurry up and get me a woman

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.600
A woman

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.399
A woman

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:56.360
I'll get one ready immediately

00:14:57.399 --> 00:14:59.519
Go find me a woman, now

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.080
Is it ready?

00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:02.080
It's ready

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.720
Please

00:15:03.039 --> 00:15:03.480
Ready

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:03.879
Yes

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:06.799
Vice-Captain Inoue, this way please

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:07.639
I'm going up

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:08.080
Please

00:15:08.799 --> 00:15:09.720
Enjoy yourself

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.639
Long time no see

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.879
Don't be like that

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:53.720
Come here

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.360
Let's

00:15:58.159 --> 00:16:00.159
Have a drink together

00:16:09.039 --> 00:16:09.759
Come on

00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:12.919
Come on

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.039
Come here

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:28.720
Come to me

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.559
Your skin is very nice

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.240
Very clean

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.960
Very lustrous

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.120
Don't worry

00:16:51.559 --> 00:16:53.000
I'm not like the others

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.480
Do you know

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.320
What I want to do?

00:17:00.159 --> 00:17:01.639
I want

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.559
Your skin

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.279
Alright

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.559
I should start cutting from here

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.400
And slice all the way to here

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.799
This way

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:24.240
I should be able to completely

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.720
Peel off your skin

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:26.839
And

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.960
It won't damage

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.799
The integrity of the front

00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:34.000
You know what?

00:17:34.599 --> 00:17:35.599
When that happens

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.279
You'll still be alive

00:17:41.079 --> 00:17:42.480
Ouch, ouch, ouch

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.480
It hurts like hell

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.279
Let go of me

00:17:44.279 --> 00:17:45.240
Let go

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.079
Let go of me right now

00:17:46.279 --> 00:17:47.279
Ouch, ouch, ouch

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.240
It hurts

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:48.880
Fukuda

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.640
Fukuda, come here quick

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.720
It's killing me

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.200
Fukuda, pull her off

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.480
You crazy woman

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.279
You Witch

00:18:02.119 --> 00:18:03.000
What's going on?

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.759
Jerk

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.920
You jerk

00:18:07.279 --> 00:18:08.279
Please calm down

00:18:08.279 --> 00:18:09.279
Your arm is injured

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.200
Go to the hospital, quick

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:13.720
Your arm is bleeding

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.079
Go to the hospital, quick

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.000
Wait till I get back

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.799
It hurts so much

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:20.680
Fukuda

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.319
Coming, coming

00:18:21.319 --> 00:18:22.480
Watch her

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.480
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.680
Be gentle.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.039
How did you get this?

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.400
I ran into a mad dog.

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:07.160
I'm going to kill her.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.759
Nurse Tang.

00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:11.519
Come over and bandage him up.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.799
I'll go get some medicine.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.079
Tang Ju'er.

00:19:33.559 --> 00:19:34.160
Tang Ju'er.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.680
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.759
Let go of me.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.160
This is a hospital.

00:19:38.519 --> 00:19:39.200
Believe me.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.759
Captain Inoue.

00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:43.119
Take this medicine three times a day.

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:44.559
Two pills at a time.

00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:47.079
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

00:19:50.039 --> 00:19:50.599
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

00:19:50.599 --> 00:19:51.960
Be gentle.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.880
You need to come back tomorrow to change the dressing.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.680
Don't let it get infected.

00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:56.000
I know.

00:19:56.319 --> 00:19:57.359
Hurry up and bandage me.

00:19:57.359 --> 00:19:57.960
Okay.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.000
It's nothing serious.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
You'll be fine after a shot and some medicine.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.680
Hurry up and give it to me.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:08.759
Over there.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:09.960
Okay.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.359
Didn't sleep well?

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.119
When did you get here?

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.480
I've been here for a long time.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.559
I've been sitting right here.

00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:53.559
No, I just arrived.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.119
What's wrong?

00:20:55.119 --> 00:20:55.960
Is something on your mind?

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.039
No.

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:01.480
Come to the hospital with me.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.599
To check on the Major.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:08.400
I'll also go see Ju'er.

00:21:09.119 --> 00:21:10.000
Then get ready.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.839
I'll wait for you here.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.200
How is your hand?

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.359
Is the injury any better?

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.359
No.

00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:47.079
Ouch.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.880
Oh, oh, oh.

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:50.880
Keep acting.

00:21:51.079 --> 00:21:52.079
Go on, keep acting.

00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:53.960
Let me see how bad your injury really is.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.079
Stop it.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.480
Be serious.

00:22:02.519 --> 00:22:03.799
I have something serious to tell you.

00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:05.200
Speak.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.319
When I went to Mount Huangyang yesterday,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.480
someone secretly entered my room.

00:22:12.319 --> 00:22:13.559
Was anything stolen?

00:22:14.079 --> 00:22:15.519
Nothing was stolen,

00:22:15.599 --> 00:22:17.200
but my suitcase was completely rummaged through.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.480
Who could it be?

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:20.880
Oshima Hiroshi?

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.319
Besides Oshima Hiroshi,

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.240
who we should be more wary of

00:22:24.559 --> 00:22:26.480
is another pair of unseen eyes.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.839
Is there any solution?

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.000
I do have a plan,

00:22:35.279 --> 00:22:36.960
but it requires your cooperation.

00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:38.480
No problem, tell me.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.640
Move in with me.

00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:39.039
Where did you go?

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.039
What are you doing?

00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:43.480
I'm sorry.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.319
Go away.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.200
Jimmy, I'm coming.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.119
Witt.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.480
Witt.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.720
What's wrong?

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.680
Are you feeling unwell somewhere?

00:25:46.759 --> 00:25:47.480
I'm fine.

00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:49.200
I'm fine.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.799
I just dreamt that

00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:56.279
Takeki, Miss Ye, and I...

00:25:56.759 --> 00:25:58.799
we were surrounded by the Japanese.

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:02.160
It's okay.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.920
The two of them will be here soon.

00:26:04.119 --> 00:26:05.240
Let's take your medicine first.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.240
Okay.

00:26:13.839 --> 00:26:15.240
I've been in the hospital for a few days.

00:26:16.039 --> 00:26:17.920
I wonder how old Mr. Ye and his family

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.200
have been doing lately.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.240
If you have the chance,

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.319
please thank them for me.

00:26:24.319 --> 00:26:25.279
Will you?

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:37.359
Nurse Tang

00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:40.000
What is it?

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:41.920
It's nothing.

00:26:43.319 --> 00:26:44.039
Of course.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.799
I am also very grateful for your care.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.359
I pray to God every day,

00:26:49.359 --> 00:26:51.480
hoping the war will end soon,

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.920
so that you can all live

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.759
a happy and joyful life.

00:26:58.559 --> 00:27:00.799
I used to think I could be happy.

00:27:02.599 --> 00:27:03.960
Now it's impossible.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.920
What's wrong?

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.200
Ah!

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.039
Put your hands where I can see them.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.599
Quick!

00:28:34.839 --> 00:28:35.960
I say,

00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:37.720
it's really strange.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.759
Our police brigade

00:28:39.839 --> 00:28:41.480
searched the whole island several times,

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.240
but just couldn't find you.

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:47.359
I didn't expect you'd actually run

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:50.039
into our hospital to recuperate.

00:28:51.079 --> 00:28:53.160
You really know how to pick a place.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:55.960
My dear,

00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:58.559
you just said,

00:28:58.759 --> 00:29:00.480
who is coming over in a bit?

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.839
It doesn't matter.

00:29:04.839 --> 00:29:06.319
Let's wait together.

00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:07.400
My dear,

00:29:08.599 --> 00:29:09.240
go,

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:11.680
close the curtains.

00:29:12.839 --> 00:29:14.240
Don't let people outside

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.640
see what's happening inside.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.839
Go.

00:29:34.759 --> 00:29:35.759
Good girl.

00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:37.359
Come here.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.160
My dear,

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.000
you've finally fallen into my hands.

00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:51.359
I won't let you go this time.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.359
Don't hurt her.

00:29:53.319 --> 00:29:54.279
Shut up.

00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:56.480
It's not up to you.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.039
Watch out.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.720
If either of you dares make a sound,

00:30:02.079 --> 00:30:03.480
I'll shoot immediately.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.079
And turn her pretty face

00:30:06.359 --> 00:30:07.920
into a bloody hole.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:12.960
Alright.

00:30:14.039 --> 00:30:17.039
Now let's act just like normal.

00:30:19.119 --> 00:30:20.480
Put it down.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.480
Keep quiet.

00:30:24.839 --> 00:30:26.559
Shh.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.920
Seeing the Colonel

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.480
is really such a joy.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.000
Put the knife over there.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.880
Vice-Captain Inoue

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:43.519
We can talk this over calmly

00:32:45.119 --> 00:32:46.519
What is there to talk about?

00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:49.359
You piece of Imperial Palace shit

00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:57.039
I really hate people like you

00:32:57.039 --> 00:32:58.680
who cause me trouble

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.240
I should exterminate all of you

00:33:03.799 --> 00:33:04.480
Hey, beautiful

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.640
Throw your bag over here

00:33:12.079 --> 00:33:13.079
Give it to him

00:33:21.319 --> 00:33:22.279
No weapons left, right?

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.960
No weapons, no weapons

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:34.839
The truth is finally out

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:38.680
All our problems are solved

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.200
Colonel

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.279
How did you manage to get such a pretty lady

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:51.599
into your hands?

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.400
No wonder

00:33:55.039 --> 00:33:56.799
our Captain kept suspecting

00:33:56.799 --> 00:33:59.039
that there was something wrong here

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.480
Tang Ju'er

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:06.519
Rest assured

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.920
I'll send you to the comfort station soon

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.400
to keep company with that

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.840
little sister named Huihui

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:15.760
Or

00:34:16.119 --> 00:34:18.599
we can all three play together later

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:19.400
Jerk

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:21.360
That's right

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:23.280
You're not wrong

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.199
Hands up

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:29.840
Quick

00:34:30.559 --> 00:34:31.519
Put your hands up

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.679
Raise them

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.960
You raise them too

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.760
Don't sleep

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:39.920
Right

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.039
One more thing

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.480
You all recognize this thing, right?

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.239
Who can tell me

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:50.840
what this is used for?

00:34:58.159 --> 00:34:59.639
What is this?

00:35:01.559 --> 00:35:02.679
Bang

00:35:08.199 --> 00:35:09.480
Look at your reactions

00:35:10.199 --> 00:35:11.480
Of course I know

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.400
what this is used for

00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:15.639
You won't talk now, huh?

00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:17.039
It doesn't matter

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.480
Wait until we get back to the Police Brigade

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.760
We can talk slowly then

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.760
Bed eight is almost fully recovered

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.679
Bed two still needs observation

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.199
So the rounds are done for today

00:35:29.199 --> 00:35:30.360
Yes

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.719
Xiaojin

00:36:05.239 --> 00:36:05.880
Who is it?

00:36:12.679 --> 00:36:13.880
Did someone call me?

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.639
Nurse Tang

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.480
What is it?

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.480
Nurse Tang

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.719
What is it?

00:36:24.039 --> 00:36:24.800
Nurse Tang

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.239
Nurse Tang

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.199
Nurse Tang

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.880
It's nothing

00:36:38.679 --> 00:36:40.760
Just now when I was changing his dressing

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.119
I hurt him

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.480
Be more careful then

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:02.880
Ju'er

00:37:03.559 --> 00:37:04.239
Ju'er

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.960
It's okay, it's okay

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.840
Calm down

00:37:14.639 --> 00:37:16.000
What do we do now?

00:37:26.119 --> 00:37:26.960
It's okay

00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:29.119
It's fine

00:37:30.159 --> 00:37:31.320
It's fine

00:37:50.239 --> 00:37:54.280
Cabbages for sale, come and buy!

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.920
Sir, we've arrived

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.079
Alright, take care, sir

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.840
Although he was my classmate

00:38:10.239 --> 00:38:11.519
he's managed to become a Colonel now

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.239
I'm not as successful as him

00:38:34.639 --> 00:38:36.800
It's been a long time, Oshima-kun.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.679
You are truly a rare guest.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.239
What is it?

00:38:46.239 --> 00:38:49.840
Second Lieutenant Yamaguchi Kyuji is from Saga.

00:38:50.599 --> 00:38:51.480
Originally assigned to the 23rd Army in Hong Kong, China,

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.400
from the Special Police Unit.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.760
A Second Lieutenant officer.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:59.079
I transferred him here; he can be trusted.

00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:04.400
Hello.

00:39:04.639 --> 00:39:05.559
It is an honor.

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:09.639
This is my subordinate, Sasaki.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.519
Pleased to meet you.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:12.880
Hello.

00:39:16.239 --> 00:39:18.920
What has stumped you, Oshima-kun?

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.719
From the Palace's Board of Chamberlains,

00:39:20.719 --> 00:39:22.119
a Colonel investigator has been sent.

00:39:23.719 --> 00:39:25.679
His name is Takeki Ichiro.

00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:27.320
He is responsible for investigating

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.280
the crash of Admiral Osumi Mineo's plane last year.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.880
He is from the Imperial Guard Division.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.639
Then you should just cooperate.

00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:35.639
Is there a problem?

00:39:37.159 --> 00:39:39.920
Could it be that Admiral Osumi's crash

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.559
has some connection to you, Oshima-kun?

00:39:41.559 --> 00:39:44.039
That is not the case.

00:39:44.519 --> 00:39:45.320
It is just that...

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.559
this man has many suspicious points,

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.320
yet he cannot be verified or investigated.

00:39:52.159 --> 00:39:54.760
Is there anything that cannot be investigated?

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.159
This man is a special envoy of the Emperor.

00:39:57.639 --> 00:39:58.480
On his documents,

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.000
there is the handwritten signature of His Majesty.

00:40:00.599 --> 00:40:01.719
Let alone me,

00:40:01.719 --> 00:40:03.480
a Captain of the Special Police Battalion,

00:40:04.239 --> 00:40:06.119
even Commander Fujita

00:40:07.639 --> 00:40:09.039
is somewhat afraid of him.

00:40:09.719 --> 00:40:10.760
Then have you verified

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.280
the authenticity of that document?

00:40:13.199 --> 00:40:14.760
How can I verify it?

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.920
If we only have telegrams,

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.199
we have no way to verify his identity.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.119
The only way is

00:40:23.559 --> 00:40:26.599
to send a telegram to those around him,

00:40:26.599 --> 00:40:29.039
or to His Majesty himself.

00:40:29.719 --> 00:40:32.800
That is indeed somewhat troublesome.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.360
Sir,

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.840
dinner is ready.

00:40:39.239 --> 00:40:40.039
Let's eat first.

00:40:40.159 --> 00:40:42.159
We can talk while we eat.

00:40:43.679 --> 00:40:44.480
That sounds good.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.559
Let's have dinner first.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.280
This way, please.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.480
That's enough.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:25.760
Come, please.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.280
Thank you.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.000
Don't mention it.

00:41:30.119 --> 00:41:31.119
Let me fill your cup.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.119
How many years has it been since we met?

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:40.679
A toast to you.

00:41:40.679 --> 00:41:41.480
Cheers.

00:41:42.559 --> 00:41:43.159
I am honored.

00:41:51.199 --> 00:41:52.400
Come, let's eat.

00:41:52.719 --> 00:41:53.719
Okay.

00:41:54.639 --> 00:41:55.480
Please.

00:41:55.639 --> 00:41:56.480
Have some food.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:58.639
Make yourself at home.

00:41:58.639 --> 00:41:59.639
All right.

00:42:02.079 --> 00:42:03.079
I want to know,

00:42:03.559 --> 00:42:05.079
regarding the former Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro,

00:42:05.079 --> 00:42:05.880
in the homeland and China,

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.920
how many intelligence agencies has he established?

00:42:08.159 --> 00:42:09.840
Why do you ask this?

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.559
The only thing I can be sure of right now

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.800
is that this Colonel Takeki

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:17.880
is a graduate of the Shanghai Tung Wen College.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.760
He should be a disciple of former Prime Minister Konoe.

00:42:23.159 --> 00:42:24.159
Is that so?

00:42:25.519 --> 00:42:26.840
Prime Minister Konoe's investigation agencies

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.320
all belong to the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau.
