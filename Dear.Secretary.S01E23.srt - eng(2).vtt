WEBVTT

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.719
President Qin

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:25.959
We're here.

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:30.239
You can get out now.

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:38.799
Is it today?

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.519
Okay, I'll be there soon.

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:44.280
Lao Wang.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.920
Thank you.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.040
Take me to the subway station.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.359
Where to? I can drive you.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.200
I won't need the car today.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.159
Yes, President Qin.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.280
To the airport.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.400
Secretary Lin.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.680
You had a fight with President Qin, didn't you?

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.479
President Qin, she's...

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.240
just like that.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.159
But she has a kind heart.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.919
Back in the day,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.960
when my child was sick,

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.680
she lent me money without a second thought.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.080
And found the best doctor.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.800
She's just a

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.599
girl with a sharp tongue but a soft heart.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.360
But,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
she's just too strong-willed.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:25.879
A lot of the time,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.919
you have to put up with her quirks.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:28.719
It's not easy.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:29.919
Being with her,

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:30.960
for many things,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.879
you need to be more tolerant.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.919
Lao Wang.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.199
I haven't asked you yet.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.520
Have you known President Qin for a long time?

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.560
Let me think.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.360
To this day,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.560
it's been twenty years.

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.560
Mom and Dad aren't coming today either?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.360
President Qin and them went to the hospital.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.120
They asked me to pick up little Meili.

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.439
They're trying for a little brother again.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.599
Why must they have a son?

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.719
Lao Wang, would you do that too?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.800
I only have a daughter.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.879
But my situation is different from President Qin's.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.599
After all, it's a family business.

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.759
Not having a son... it's hard to explain.

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.400
I don't like them doing this.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.360
And my annoying relatives too.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.240
Always saying those awful things to me.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.159
I will make them see.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.520
That I, Qin Meili,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.199
am better than ten of their sons.

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.039
Good. Remember that.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.199
You have to follow through.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.560
You don't know,

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.800
President Qin, when she was little,

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.519
was strong-willed from the start.

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:21.800
Wanted to be number one.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.000
I'm not like you.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.399
You can go home anytime.

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:29.000
There's a company waiting for you to take over.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.959
But where I am today,

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.079
I achieved under immense family pressure.

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:36.319
Step by step, I fought for it myself.

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:38.199
That's why, all along,

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.800
the only one I could completely trust

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.279
and rely on,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.839
was myself.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.600
Don't get worked up while you're away.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.639
Listen to your mother.

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.560
Receive the treatment.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.240
Don't worry.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.680
Why so sudden?

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.839
Xiao Hai decided it himself.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.399
As long as he gets treatment soon.

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.000
Don't worry.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.560
He won't be gone for too long.

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:31.639
Xiao Hai.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:36.680
Calling you that suddenly,

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.000
feels a bit strange.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:41.279
You know everything.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.160
Truly, if you live long enough,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.360
you get to see everything.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.639
Even my stubborn eldest son

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:10.759
and my cold younger son's

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.560
"reconciliation of the century."

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.319
Where's Old Lin?

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.480
It seems

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.319
you can really rest in peace now.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Don't talk nonsense.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.720
It seems

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:29.839
we're still not used to this way of interacting.

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:33.000
So,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.839
this...

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.199
read it after I've left.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.560
Be safe on the road.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.759
Alright.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.959
You all go back now.

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:56.000
Uh...

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:03.160
Go home early.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.399
I'm off.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.079
Son.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.680
I'm leaving.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.680
They're all gone.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.040
You couldn't even call him "brother."

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:21.160
My eloquent little son,

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.600
you should go do stand-up comedy.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.480
Xiao Hai

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:41.000
It's really hard to say this.

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:42.399
To call you "little brother."

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:45.319
So I chose to do it this way.

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:50.079
After hearing what Mom and Dad said,

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:52.639
at first, I was just angry.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.079
For so many years,

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:57.600
I've held such a grudge against you.

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:01.680
"Our precious son won another award!"

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.519
"Son, you're amazing, really."

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:07.240
"So, what do you think?"

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.399
"Where do you want to go?"

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:09.600
"Mom and Dad will take you."

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.279
"I want to go to the amusement park."

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:14.639
"Okay, no problem!"

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.160
"Do you want to have a big feast?"

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:18.120
"Yes."

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:18.959
"Alright then!"

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:21.040
"Then Dad will take you for a feast, okay?"

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:22.160
"Okay."

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.160
"Son,"

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:26.600
"healthy, smart,"

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.120
"and so outstanding."

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:29.720
No matter what you did,

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.439
you'd always get praised before me.

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:35.279
I told myself countless times

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.639
that I had to be even better.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.279
Only by being better

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.240
could I be seen.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.000
But I was truly pathetic.

00:08:47.679 --> 00:08:49.039
So I was really jealous of you.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.080
After doing that terrible thing,

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:56.360
for a time, I couldn't face

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.200
that version of myself filled with malice.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.279
But as my emotions gradually settled,

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:03.039
I finally understood

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.639
how much I owed you.

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:09.960
I'm sorry.

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:11.679
My little brother.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.559
For all the past events,

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.679
I've always owed you these words.

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:18.600
I'm sorry.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.279
Because I didn't dare hope for

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:23.159
your forgiveness.

00:09:23.879 --> 00:09:25.320
That's why I couldn't say it.

00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:27.639
But please rest assured,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.279
from now on,

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:31.279
I will actively receive treatment.

00:09:31.879 --> 00:09:33.840
To soon step out of this life shrouded in gloom.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.559
When that time comes,

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.840
I will stand before you again

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:40.080
and say these words to you in person,

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:41.879
to earn your forgiveness.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.759
Finally,

00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:48.840
I wish you and Qin Meili

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:50.480
lasting happiness.

00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:52.759
Your brother,

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:54.559
Xiao Han.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.639
Brother.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.240
I forgive you.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.360
You called me.

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:09.360
I meant to call Secretary Li,

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.960
but I dialed the wrong number by mistake.

00:11:12.159 --> 00:11:12.960
Okay.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.120
Okay.

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:15.720
Well, that's it then.

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:16.840
Oh, right.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.279
For the next few days,

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:21.679
I won't be coming back to stay.

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:24.039
Mom and Lin Hai have gone abroad.

00:11:25.159 --> 00:11:26.320
Dad asked me

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.720
to go home and stay with him for a while.

00:11:31.679 --> 00:11:32.840
Got it.
