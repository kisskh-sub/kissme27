00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.510
Mr. Xiao.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.310
Mr. Hu is right.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.190
Hu Xiu.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.240
I wish you a new year

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.890
free from all worries.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.020
Cheers.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.530

Celebrating the New Year
in the lane this time

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.880
feels pretty nice, doesn't it?

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.950
All those wishes

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.430
my parents made at dinner just now weren't

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.120
what I truly wanted.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.830
Rather than a peaceful and smooth life,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.079
I prefer challenges.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.840
This year,

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.280
I want to complete
Lyman's projects perfectly.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.910
If I get the chance,

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.790
I also want to work
on projects of my own design.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.150
I want to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.240
hone my professional skills.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.410
I want to do more things

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.470
I haven't tried before.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.000
I want...

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.100
What about you?

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.090
Is there anything you're determined
to accomplish this year?

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.800
I want to...

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.000
Find that answer.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.360
Don't torment yourself.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.240
I believe you'll find it.

-Watch out.

The Design Competition is over.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.210
I'll move out

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.350
in a few days.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.600
What do you mean?

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.880
I'll terminate my lease early.

What are you doing here?

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.890
Happy New Year, Hu Xiu.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.720
I'm here to help Xiao Zhiyu move.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.340

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.440
Yeah.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.010
Can you believe it?
During the New Year holiday,

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.470
he's asking me to work
like a moving company.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.770
He didn't tell you that?

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.480
What do you mean?

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.280
I've been busy these days,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.260
so I asked him to go there to help.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.660
You know that's not
what I'm talking about.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.120
Fine,

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.140
I get it.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.480

I'm hanging it by your door.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.600
See if there's anything else
you need to check.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.120
This is his stuff.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.790
Take it away.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.270
Okay.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.530
So, for the New Year...

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:08.270
What's wrong with you?

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.880
You are actually free today.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.910
But why did you still boss me around?

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.670
Well, I can tell
even if you don't tell me.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.930
The faces of you two already gave it away.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.780
What's up with her?

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.960
She's like a firecracker
that didn't get set off on New Year's Eve,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.100
ready to blow any minute

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.360
without holding back.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.870
Listen, Xiao,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.480
did you provoke her again?

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.580
Or why would anyone throw a temper tantrum
during the New Year holiday?

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.000
So...

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.670
You mean

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.970
you want to seek cooperation with me?

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:16.720
Yes.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.190
But I have 1 condition.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.160
Our cooperation
needs to be kept confidential.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.640
Hu Xiu, good luck back at work.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.900
Good luck back at work.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.240
Mr. Sun, good luck back at work.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:44.600

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.000
You terminated your lease early.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.290
I'll refund you the unused rent
based on the remaining days.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:56.220
There's no need.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.570
I got your bank account number
from Mr. Gong.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.350
It's not much money anyway.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.720
I just don't like leaving things unclear.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.770
Mr. Pei, this way please.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.120

This way, please.

Thank you.

making Lyman's projects.

Hu Xiu.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.410
Hello everyone.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.020
Mr. Pei, you only brought

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.440
one assistant with you today?

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.480
Actually, no.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.600
Let them in when they're ready.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.860
Just a moment, please.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.970
Mr. Pei.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.800
Since this is our first collaboration,

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.280
and it happens to be the New Year,

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.480
I've prepared some gifts for everyone.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.430
This doesn't seem appropriate.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:24.630
Don't worry, guys.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.290
These gifts aren't expensive.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.290
Just a small token of sincerity.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:29.960
Ms. Zhou,

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.030
this is for you.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:34.320
I've long heard

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.440
that you graduated
from the Wharton School.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.750
Not only are you professionally competent,

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.550
but you also
handle things very efficiently.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.360
So,

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.720
a beautiful career woman's shoes

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.840
must be well-maintained

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.390
so that they can help you go

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.200
more steadily

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:45.930
and further.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.870
Thank you.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:48.750
Happy New Year.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.490
A few years ago, in Pudong,

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.410
there was a theater project

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.740
that I wanted to work on
with Engineer Sun.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.310
Unexpectedly, D Studio got ahead of us.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.240
This time,

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.600
I can finally fulfill one of my wishes.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.860
Open it and take a look.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.440
It's a luxury brand.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.210
This...

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:06.120
This is

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.790
from a very famous Italian design company.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:08.390
That's right.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.990
This is the ruler
their designers use for work.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.770
I heard that you, Engineer Sun,
love collecting work tools.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.120
Their director is my friend,

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.780
so I specially got one for you.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:22.290
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.170
That's so nice of you.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.120
Don't mention it.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.920
Engineer Tan,

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.510
this one is for you.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.150
Thank you.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.410
Everyone, have a seat.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.350
I learned that you like sweets

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.030
at the cocktail party that day,

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.960
so I had my staff
ask the chef from that day

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.490
to make you some chocolate.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.410
Give it a try.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.720
Thanks.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.490
Happy to work with you.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.830
Mr. Pei, you're really thoughtful
about these things.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.720
Well, I'm here for business after all.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.920
It's what I should do.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.360
By the way,

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.600
I know very little about you,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.840
Mr. Xiao,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.800
and I really don't know what you like.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.000
I hope you don't mind?

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.830
Mr. Pei, let's skip the small talk.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.080
Since we're working together,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.490
let's focus on efficiency

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:22.750
and start the meeting.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.430
I have no objections to today's agenda.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:33.320
Zhuling will offer

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.720
the list of building material suppliers

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.030
and their qualification reports
to your company

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.840
as soon as possible.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.260
Good.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.770
Then we'll wait for Zhuling's submission.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.390
There's one more thing.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:42.390
Mr. Xie mentioned

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.910
that before the studio and Zhuling

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.510
formally sign the contract,

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.320
we need to submit our financial statements
from the past year respectively

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.840
to Lyman for review

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.100
so as to ensure transparency
in our cooperation.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.150
We've already submitted
our financial statement.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.480
Please submit yours soon as well, Mr. Pei.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.240
No problem.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.480
Well,

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:01.960
if there's nothing else,

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.820
let's conclude today's meeting.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:04.910
How about

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:05.510
I treat everyone

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:06.840
to a meal?

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.730
We have many more meetings to hold,

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:11.930
so we'll have to pass.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:18.400
Alright,

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.880
I will leave you to it then.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.550
Let's exchange WeChat contacts

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.960
for future collaboration.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.800
How about this?

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.580
I'll create a group chat

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.140
for the designers to add you.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:28.800
No problem.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:31.960
Mr. Pei,

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.000
I've created the group chat,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.270
and all the designers have added you.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:34.790
Okay.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.120
Ms. Hu,

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.390
I've added you.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.540
We couldn't have lunch together today.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.470
Hope we can have a chance next time.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.240
Take care, Mr. Pei.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.569
This time, you did a great job

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.500
on the studio's background check.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.640
It's my duty, Mr. Pei.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.349
However,

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.069
regarding Ms. Hu's background check,

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:21.000
I couldn't find much information.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.030
She?

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:24.900
You don't need to investigate her.

Mr. Xiao.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.460

Mr. Xiao,

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.430
I've checked today's schedule.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.590
There are no other meetings at the moment.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.270
Dad,

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.440
I'm home.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.000
I heard from Shen Jie

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.440
that Lyman wants the financial statement
of Zhuling from the past year.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:24.510
Yes.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.270
Mr. Xie knows

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.300
my relationship with Xiao Zhiyu.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.720
If the studio and Zhuling
want to collaborate,

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.860
we need to provide financial reports
for Lyman to review.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.420
After all, they need to monitor
the safety of project funds.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.950
It's a reasonable request.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.210
This is my fault.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.600
I should have reported to you first.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.100
Securing the Lyman's project is
the priority.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.510
I'll tell Shen Jie

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.890
to send you the financial report.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:51.510
Okay.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.530
I'll go upstairs first.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.830
Mr. Xiao.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.780
Zhuling has replied

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:22.410
that their financial statement will be
sent to Lyman 2 days late.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.310
There's something else
I need to discuss with you.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.000
According
to the preliminary cooperation process,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.960
we need to send a liaison representative

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.790
to the construction site
managed by Zhuling

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.000
to conduct
a construction management inspection.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.790
Afterward, Zhuling will provide

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.720
a complete list of suppliers

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.850
for us to recommend.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.510
As for the liaison,

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.470
Mr. Pei

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.700
specifically wants Hu Xiu to follow up.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.040
Mr. Pei has been paying a lot of attention
to Hu Xiu lately.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.940
But if you think there's any issue,

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.030
I can find a way to decline

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.760
and send someone else instead.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.590
No,

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.200
let her go.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.000
Recently,

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.600
she's put in quite a lot of effort

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.930
looking for suppliers.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.380
She's very familiar
with each one's situation.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:08.920
She is the best choice.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.270
Indeed.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.000
Regardless of how Pei Zhen treats her,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.960
we shouldn't ignore her contributions.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.020
Otherwise, it would be unfair to her.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.350
Besides,

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.570
she can handle it well.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.350
Since she joined the company,

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.770
her capabilities have been
self-evident to everyone.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.240
Zhou Yan from D Studio has replied,

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.240
agreeing to let Ms. Hu

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.770
handle the follow-up work.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:40.790
Director Shen?

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.200
The Chairman is also here today?

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.240
Director Shen.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.580
Mr. Pei.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.700
Did something happen?

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.400
No.

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.510
It's just that these documents are
a bit tricky to work on.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.510
Nothing serious.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:58.000
Mr. Pei,

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.750
Chairman Pei just instructed me

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.550
to sort out the financial report

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.640
and give it to you.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:03.680
However,

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.860
you'll need to wait a few days.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:07.160
okay.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.910
Go ahead with your work.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.130
[Chairman's Office]

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.720
Hu Xiu.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.830
I'm assigning you
to coordinate with Zhuling.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:34.310
Later,

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:37.270
you'll go with Mr. Pei
to inspect Zhuling's construction site.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.750
Well,

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.350
will Hu Xiu be going alone?

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:40.150
What about me?

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:41.680
One person is enough.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:42.640
Besides,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.590
Mr. Pei specifically requested

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.250
Hu Xiu to coordinate with him.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.920
What's all the fuss about?

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.510
You don't have enough work to do

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:54.970
and want to work overtime?

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.070
Both Mr. Xiao and I

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.790
trust your work skills completely.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:03.880
Do your best.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.880
If there's anything inappropriate

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.570
from Mr. Pei's side,

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.990
let me know immediately.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.240
Good luck.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.030
Hu Xiu,

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.000
I've noticed something.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.480
Mr. Pei treats you

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.270
quite differently.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.310
No.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.540
Yes!

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.230
Sun told us last time

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.270
that at the Lyman's cocktail party,

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.250
Mr. Pei specifically invited you to dance.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.970
You two looked like a perfect match.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.770
Wait, why are you giving me away?

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.070
Sun Yifei.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.510
I've finished
reviewing the materials for you.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.110
You're just way too idle.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:44.550
Hey, but what I said is backed
by evidence.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.720
During the meeting that day,

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.070
Mr. Pei gave us gifts, right?

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.830
He was giving very formal gifts
to the rest of us.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.030
Yep.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.290
But when it came to you,

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.440
it was chocolate.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:52.830
How sweet and romantic.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:53.670
Right?

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.960
Isn't it still sitting at your desk?

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.640
You quite value it, don't you?

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.240
And you put it on the left side,

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.000
the closest to your heart.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.130
Value it? Nonsense!

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:03.880
I put it there,

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.310
so everyone can share it.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:06.370
Come on.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.830
L-Let me share it with you all.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.190
There's chocolate to eat!

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.850
-Then give me one.
-I want one.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.920
That's not what I meant.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.750
I saw you laughing heartily just now.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.360
I won't give any to you two either.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.220
Here, catch it.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.110
We're celebrating
our store's second anniversary.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:32.830
Here's a customized gift for you.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.880
We specifically asked a designer
to design it.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.230
It's exclusive to our store.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.960
Here you are.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.510
You can put it in your café.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.510
Happy second wedding anniversary.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.060
I was charging my phone
in your car earlier

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.870
and forgot to take my cable.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.560
When can you return it to me?

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.400
It's only charged to 60 percent.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:44.190
Can you stay longer next time?

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.730
It's said that unplugging your phone
before it's fully charged

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:48.380
affects the battery life.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.310
Chi Xin.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:55.270
Do you remember her?

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.350
At the networking event back then,

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.160
Chi Xin specifically came over

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.090
to add Guangming on WeChat.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.480
Guangming refused her immediately.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.640
Later, she came to me

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.680
and asked me to give her his WeChat.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:12.530
Go get some more sleep.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:13.530
It's still early.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.550
No way.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.480
I thought of some new desserts last night.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.740
I need to give them a try
at the shop today.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:22.290
Why am I feeling so drowsy?

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.750
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.080
I'm helping you wake up.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.880
That monitoring system you developed is

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.080
actually pretty good.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.100
There's a project we're planning to launch

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.140
that's similar to what you're doing.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.140
Let's talk about it in person later.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:47.660
You didn't eat much.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:51.280
Senior, I'll be there shortly.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.680
I've brought all the project materials.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.480
What's wrong?

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.850
Just a spam text.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.110
Senior,

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:03.830
you made me come all this way

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.440
just to be your driver?

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.680
Let's find a place

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:08.720
to discuss the project.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.830
My client is back from Germany

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:23.650
and wants to explore
Shanghai's snack shops.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:24.910
Are you free to join us?

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:25.610
Yes, I'm free.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:27.540
I submitted my resignation today.

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:28.930
That's great.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.120
Now you can focus on our project.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.280
Honey, what brings you here?

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.860
Should we go to the double-rice cake store
or the pan-fried bun restaurant first?

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.100
I haven't had carbs like these in ages.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.720
The project is going so smoothly.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.050
Don't you think I deserve a little reward?

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.070
Honey,

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.470
I was suddenly invited
to a business dinner tonight.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.000
Get some rest early.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.370
I just saw many people
still waiting outside.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.070
You must've lined up for quite a while
for this restaurant, huh?

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.160
It's nothing.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.890
I really appreciate your help
with this project.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.030
Hello, sir.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.160
Here's your receipt.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.790
It's 1,314 yuan in total.

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:09.310
Okay.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.720
Also,

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.440
today is our store's second anniversary.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.770
This is a special customized gift for you.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:16.590
Second anniversary?

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:08.350
Honey?

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.710
You didn't go to the shop today?

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.530
I-I didn't sleep well.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.410
I want to get some rest at home.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:28.640
Did I wake you up when I came home

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:29.830
this morning?

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:45.830
Are you going to the office today?

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:48.830
Yes, I'm leaving now.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.770
Go get some more sleep.

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.150
I'm off.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:17.720
Sir,

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.510
I called this taxi.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:19.870
Please follow that car in front closely.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:20.390
Okay.

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:02.140
Sleeping in this late,

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.400
you haven't eaten yet, huh?

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:06.590
Thanks.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.020
Your lunch break is really long.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.920
Thanks to you.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.510
I told my boss I was coming out for work,

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:14.880
so he let me go.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.400
After all these meetings this morning,

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:19.900
my battery has been running low.

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:21.680
If I didn't come out for some fresh air,

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.830
I'd shut down.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:28.760
Take it for recharging.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.960
Just this?

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.690
This is what I call recharging.

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:22.590
Zhuling's financial statement

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:24.250
hasn't been sent to Lyman yet.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.600
They said
it would be delayed by 2 more days.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.030
Zhuling is a large enterprise

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.050
with complex finances.

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:30.310
It's understandable.

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:32.640
Then I'll follow up on this.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:35.270
Hu Xiu went out

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.400
to inspect Zhuling's construction site
with Mr. Pei.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:51.270
Ms. Hu,

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:52.690
can't get a taxi again?

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:56.030
Mr. Pei,

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.830
weren't we supposed to meet
at the construction site?

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.350
I had some things to handle nearby.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.170
Since it's on my way anyway,

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:02.230
let's go together.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:12.430
[We're calling 7 types of cars for you.]

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.570
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:15.640
To avoid being late,

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.710
I'll gladly accept your offer.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:33.870
Coffee.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.110
Mr. Pei, you've been waiting for me
for a while, right?

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:44.200
Why do you say that?

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:47.480
The coffee isn't even hot anymore.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:50.750
It's fine.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.920
It's only been about half an hour.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.070
It's rare for you to wait
for someone, Mr. Pei.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.650
Then I won't refuse your kindness.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:59.110
Thank you for treating me.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.550
When I suggested you as the liaison,

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:08.610
I thought Xiao Zhiyu wouldn't agree.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:10.760
Since we're going to work together,

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.840
there will surely be

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.500
plenty of coordination work.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.550
Mr. Pei,
you don't need to go to such trouble,

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.409
picking me up and dropping me off.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:21.040
Seems like you want to draw the line
with me again, Ms. Hu.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.800
Yes, of course.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:25.650
I don't want to become
part of office gossip.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.110
What gossip?

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:30.030
They say

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.070
you specifically requested me
to coordinate with you

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.400
because you're into me.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:38.480
It's fine. Don't worry.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.230
Well, then,

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:47.000
what do you think?

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.510
Mr. Pei,

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.730
I know my place.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.320
I know

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:56.560
your focus has never been on me,

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.070
but on Xiao Zhiyu.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.960
What makes you say that?

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.270
Mr. Pei, your time is too valuable

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.730
to waste
on insignificant people or things.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:08.800
As a nobody,

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.230
the only reason I caught your attention

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:13.760
must be my relationship with Xiao Zhiyu.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:19.110
You used me to probe him,

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.260
wanted to provoke him through me,

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.980
and smeared him in front of me.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:25.030
I couldn't figure it out before.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.710
It was just business competition.

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.640
Why were you targeting him so much?

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.410
But after learning
about your family matters

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.640
and the relationship between you two,

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:37.680
it finally made some sense.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.230
Seems like I'm a villain

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.320
in your eyes, Ms. Hu.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:48.550
I just want to do my job well.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.620
What about Xiao Zhiyu?

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:53.760
Does he also see you

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.420
as just an ordinary employee?

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.260
Yes, of course.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.710
Mr. Xiao

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.110
respects his employees.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.070
He wouldn't deprive

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.070
any employee of work opportunities

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.030
due to the current conflicts
between you two.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.150
So, Mr. Pei,

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.480
please don't use me

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.480
as a tool in your family infighting.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:25.710
I never realized before

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.880
that you're so blunt, Ms. Hu.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.770
Do you feel offended, Mr. Pei?

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:34.880
I'm just surprised.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.700
You used to work as a GM assistant.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:42.480
I thought you would be someone diplomatic

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.860
and cautious in handling things.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.050
My idea of being diplomatic isn't

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:50.840
carefully crafting lies,

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.710
but rather

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.580
speaking the truth politely.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.040
It seems that I don't know you very well.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.420
Well, that being the case,

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.420
let's formally get to know
each other today.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:10.760
Mr. Pei,

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.740
we'll be working side by side from now on.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.150
I hope that between us,

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.710
there can be less pretense

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:17.840
and more sincerity,

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.730
so we can get this project done perfectly.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.610
Sounds good.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.620
Here they come.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.440
Mr. Pei,

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.150
welcome.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.180
Supervisor Xu.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.480
Thank you for your work.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:02.830
Let me introduce you.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.800
This is Supervisor Xu from Zhuling,

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.920
in charge of the project engineering.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.590
Hello, Supervisor Xu.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.760
I'm Hu Xiu,
an assistant designer from D Studio.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.590
Ms. Hu, welcome to inspect our site.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:10.510
You're too kind.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:11.110
Zhuling's construction sites

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:13.220
have always set the standard
in the industry.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.220
I'm actually here to learn from you.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.050
Mr. Pei needs to get changed.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:29.840
He puts a set of clothes here

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.110
as he comes here to inspect every day.

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:32.110
For convenience.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.610
You come here every day?

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.050
Seems like you don't

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.510
know me very well, either.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:37.830
Take your time.

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:41.470
I'll take Ms. Hu there first.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.380
Come on.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.920
This way, please.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.330
Let's go.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.800
Ms. Hu,

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.570
let me give you a brief introduction.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:49.930
This construction site is

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:50.550
♪ Think about you ♪

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:51.110

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.530
one of our largest sites
under construction.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.570

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.090
The external elevators

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:31.490
and the material hoists.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:33.030
The safety gates
of these unloading platforms

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:34.400
must be closed according to regulations.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.280
We can't be careless.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.360
Don't worry, Mr. Pei.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.960
Yes, you remind us of it
every time you come.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.800
I'm keeping a close eye on it.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.590
There won't be any slip-ups.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:40.800
Familiarity breeds neglect.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.400
These reminders
can never be repeated enough.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:45.510
There cannot be any accidents on site.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:46.630
Safety is our bottom line.

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:47.150
Understood.

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.710
Yes.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.750
You may get back to work now.

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:50.410
Please rest assured, Mr. Pei.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.960
Ms. Hu.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:39:59.960
What is it?

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.510
Did you notice any problems?

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:02.110
Nope.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.950
Zhuling really lives up to its reputation.

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:06.630
What reputation?

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.440
Everyone says

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.400
Zhuling's construction sites

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.110
have the most standardized management

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:12.770
and the best safety measures.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:14.980
Isn't it the most basic principle

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.620
to ensure workers' safety?

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.620
If only every construction site
could follow this.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:23.150
What?

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:24.710
Did you encounter any problems

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:26.770
with your previous projects, Ms. Hu?

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:29.290
It was about my dad.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.960
He used to be a lighting engineer,

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.850
responsible for lighting installations
in many large venues.

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:37.180
He was injured in a construction accident.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.710
It happened many years ago.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.510
Accidents at construction sites are

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:42.040
always life-threatening.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:43.530
Although your father was injured,

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:45.990
he actually lucked out
given the situation.

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.170
But as long as one is alive,

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:49.550
there is hope.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:06.430
Mr. Xiao,

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:07.990
I'm clocking out.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.120
Well...

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:12.800
Is Hu Xiu

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.580
still not done
inspecting the construction site?

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.910
I just called and asked.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.590
She said the inspection was over,

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.190
but she needed to go
to Zhuling with Mr. Pei.
