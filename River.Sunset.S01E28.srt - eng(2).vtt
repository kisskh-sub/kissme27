00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.480
Deputy Captain Inoue Kamakura

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.319
fought bravely

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.000
and died in action

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.159
All right, I understand

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:53.639
Life after life in the three realms

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.960
Year after year, endless yet still

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:21.800
Watching reincarnation by the Bridge of Helplessness

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:34.719
Guided by spirits, listening to ghostly whispers

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.680
Retribution

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.719
You old geezer

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.879
I'm sending you back today

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:07.719
Inoue Agency

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.000
Mr. Inoue Akira

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.479
Yesterday, during an enemy

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.719
attack on the 6th Air Base

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.240
Deputy Captain Inoue Kamakura

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.319
fought bravely

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.560
and died in action

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:24.240
It's almost cherry blossom season

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.639
I had them learn this dance especially for you

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:28.800
Please take a look, General

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.199
It's like being back home

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.800
when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:41.480
It is rare for you to be so thoughtful, Inoue-kun

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.800
Thank you for your trouble

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.160
Have another drink

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.839
Sect Leader

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.720
Impossible

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.240
I am old

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:05.560
Unable to kill my enemy with my own hands

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.879
I missed the chance to avenge my brothers

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.040
and the more than ten thousand

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.959
villagers who died on Sanzao Island

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:16.240
It was a great opportunity for revenge

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.279
I have failed my ancestors

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:25.079
and the spirits of my brothers in heaven

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:32.720
I am incompetent

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:43.759
Master

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:45.839
Master

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.759
Master

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:51.040
Several merchants from Sanzao Island are here to see you

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.959
Bring them in

00:07:58.959 --> 00:07:59.600
Yes, sir

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:10.600
About this matter

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.000
we must ask Master Geng for an explanation

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.839
Right

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.120
We need to verify it

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.319
Master Geng

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.920
We heard that

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.639
there is news coming from Macau

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:21.800
that the Japanese on Sanzao Island

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.720
will lift the sea ban in a couple of days

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.120
and allow islanders to go fishing

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.399
Is this true?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.480
That can't be right

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.200
Ever since the Japs entered the island

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.840
they banned sea travel

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.360
It's been over four years

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:42.480
Where did you

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.759
hear this news from?

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:45.320
Master Geng

00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:47.080
It was overheard by someone

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.159
working at the Japanese Consulate

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:51.279
This news should be true

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.480
Let me think

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.240
about this matter

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.159
Once I figure it out

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:04.120
I will let you all know

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.399
I'll also send someone to ask around

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:11.960
I'll notify everyone when I have news

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.639
At that time

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:13.840
we can discuss it properly

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:14.919
All right then, Master Geng

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:15.879
We'll take our leave

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:16.759
Goodbye

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.000
Lao Yi, see them out

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.759
Yes

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:00.399
Lao Yi

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.360
Arrange for someone to find out

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.320
if Director Shen from the Nationalist Government

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.519
has returned yet

00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:05.320
I have an important matter

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.240
to discuss with him

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.320
Yes, sir

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:27.159
Make way

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:28.919
Make way

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:29.840
Coming through

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:31.159
Make way

00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:34.600
Sir

00:10:59.799 --> 00:11:00.759
Sir

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:02.120
Take a break first.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.559
Old Zheng,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.799
these past few days,

00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:06.279
is there any news?

00:11:08.039 --> 00:11:08.600
Our

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.960
informant in the Portuguese police reported

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.639
that something happened today.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:16.080
From the Sanzao Island 6th Air Base,

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:18.039
a Special Police Brigade Captain

00:11:18.039 --> 00:11:19.759
brought men to Macau.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.960
The Eighth District Gang wanted revenge

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.240
and sent men to take them out.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.720
A shootout ensued,

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.799
and several people were injured.

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:28.000
What was the result?

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:29.720
In the end,

00:11:29.799 --> 00:11:31.480
the Sakae Agency's action team in Macau

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:32.480
saved them.

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.039
The assassination failed.

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:35.639
How did the Sakae Agency people

00:11:35.639 --> 00:11:37.120
know about the assassination?

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:39.080
News probably leaked out.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.279
The Eighth District Gang of Anlan Hall

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:43.840
isn't very discreet in their operations.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.559
Make arrangements.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.120
I'm going to Anlan Hall.

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:48.519
Now?

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:49.639
Right now.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.480
How about this.

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:18.639
Hurry and contact the people on the island first.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.399
Get the facts straight.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.279
The Japanese lifting the sea ban,

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.159
what is it really about?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.000
Who exactly is allowed to go to sea?

00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:30.720
When can they go?

00:12:30.879 --> 00:12:31.759
After they go out,

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:33.639
are there gunboats from the island watching?

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:35.360
Go find out these details.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.039
Yes.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.159
I'll do it right away.

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:38.919
I reckon,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.080
if this matter is true,

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.240
maybe we can make good use of it.

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:50.240
As long as we clarify the situation,

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:52.600
perhaps we can conveniently

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.279
get my brother's family off the island.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.720
Master,

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.279
what if this is a trap?

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:04.000
Oh,

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.639
I also have a bad feeling.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.919
I'm worried there's something wrong with this.

00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:12.960
Yes.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.720
The Japanese on this island,

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.159
when have they ever been so kind?

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.639
For them to actually lift the sea ban

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:21.759
and let villagers go fishing,

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.240
that is just too strange.

00:13:24.799 --> 00:13:26.519
Contact the island first.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.639
Keep it quiet.

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:29.639
Okay.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.600
Master Geng,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.120
Director Shen from the Nationalist Government has arrived.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:39.960
Mr. Ye,

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.840
how do you do?

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.080
Director Shen,

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.279
I was just sending someone to look for you.

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:44.000
Coming in such a hurry,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.799
is there an urgent matter?

00:13:44.799 --> 00:13:45.600
It's quite a coincidence.

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:47.399
I just returned to Macau from out of town.

00:13:47.759 --> 00:13:49.360
I heard that the Sanzao Island

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.200
Special Police Brigade Captain arrived in Macau.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:51.879
Is that so?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.639
We brought men over immediately.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.080
This news traveled so fast.

00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:57.600
Don't mind it.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.639
Our Military Statistics Bureau has inside the Macau Portuguese police

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:01.799
a few informants.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.320
Director Shen,

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.039
you are a step too late.

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:13.080
That Japanese Special Police Captain,

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:15.320
he slipped away.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.840
What a pity.

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:41.720
Mr. Ye,

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.960
I understand what you mean.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.360
Let me say something,

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.720
you might not like it.

00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:48.840
I am a rough man,

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.200
please speak frankly.

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:52.159
The failure of your operation this time,

00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:54.399
it must be that within the Eighth District Gang,

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:56.279
there is a Japanese mole.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.200
Impossible.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.879
In the Eighth District Gang,

00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:04.960
there are no cowards like you describe.

00:15:05.159 --> 00:15:06.639
Macau today,

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:08.919
is like the "Solitary Island" of Shanghai back then.

00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:12.120
Spies from all over the world are active here.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.600
Between themselves,

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.639
they spy on each other's military intelligence,

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:18.360
exchange benefits,

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.200
and raise war funds.

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:23.519
Of course,

00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:26.240
usually there are situations where

00:15:26.919 --> 00:15:28.240
our people

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.279
are bought over by heavy bribes

00:15:30.279 --> 00:15:31.720
to serve them.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.519
Likewise,

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:35.639
their people,

00:15:35.879 --> 00:15:37.399
we also buy over

00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:38.799
to serve us.

00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:39.840
Things like this,

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.360
we have experienced many times.

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:44.200
So I can assure you,

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:46.559
the failure of your operation,

00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:48.759
the problem must lie within.

00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:52.480
Are you that certain?

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.279
Mr. Ye,

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:55.600
if necessary,

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.639
our Military Statistics Bureau can help.

00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:01.639
Impossible.

00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:04.960
You are overthinking it.

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:09.200
Perhaps I am overthinking it.

00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:12.279
Come, come,

00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:13.320
please sit.

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:19.399
Director Shen, you are well-informed.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.960
I need to ask for your advice.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.200
Right now, outside,

00:16:23.799 --> 00:16:25.639
a rumor is spreading.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.240
Sanzao Island

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.840
is going to lift the sea ban soon,

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.480
and allow the fishermen on the island

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.840
to go out to sea and fish.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.159
Do you think this is reliable?

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:40.480
Excuse me,

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.480
what does "lifting the sea ban" mean?

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.360
Since February of the 27th Year of the Republic,

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.639
after the Japanese occupied Sanzao Island,

00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:50.879
they built a naval and air base there.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.240
They haven't let fishermen fish at sea since.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.039
It's been four or five years.

00:16:55.559 --> 00:16:56.919
Outsiders aren't allowed in,

00:16:57.039 --> 00:16:58.320
and insiders aren't allowed out.

00:16:58.639 --> 00:17:00.759
Now this news suddenly comes out,

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:03.759
and I find it very surprising too.

00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:06.359
That's interesting.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.279
Four or five years...

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.559
this is indeed a bit fishy.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.480
It really is worth looking into.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.480
Do you have any thoughts?

00:17:19.279 --> 00:17:20.599
Stranded here in Macau,

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.039
some gentry from Sanzao Island came to me.

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:26.200
They want to take this opportunity

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:27.839
to get the people on the island,

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.160
their family members, out.

00:17:31.279 --> 00:17:32.759
But I was thinking,

00:17:32.759 --> 00:17:34.599
if this matter is true,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.119
maybe I can also

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.519
get my brother's family on the island

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:40.799
brought here to Macau.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.000
I understand.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:47.480
Rest assured,

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:50.119
our colleagues at the Macau station

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:51.759
will go investigate immediately.

00:17:52.119 --> 00:17:53.240
If there is anything,

00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:54.839
I will reply to you as soon as possible.

00:17:56.119 --> 00:17:57.519
Then I'm counting on you.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.319
If this matter is true,

00:17:59.319 --> 00:18:01.119
I need to go make some preparations.

00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:03.160
I will take my leave then.

00:18:05.599 --> 00:18:06.240
Goodbye.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.519
Thank you.

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:17.880
Lao Yi

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.400
Master

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.839
This Director Shen from the Nationalist government suspects

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.559
that this assassination attempt failed

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:31.759
because within our ranks

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.720
there is a mole

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:35.720
A mole?

00:18:37.359 --> 00:18:38.079
That can't be

00:18:39.559 --> 00:18:41.079
When he said that

00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:43.319
my heart started pounding

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:45.640
Logically speaking

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.160
very few people knew about this matter

00:18:48.039 --> 00:18:50.160
How could people from the Japanese secret service

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.799
get the news too?

00:18:52.839 --> 00:18:54.200
So it seems

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.640
this matter

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.559
is a bit fishy

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:16.119
Do you think

00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:19.720
among the people around us recently

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.000
is there anyone acting suspiciously?

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.519
Could it be

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:35.920
Don't say his name

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.160
I know who you're talking about

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.920
We must not make this public

00:19:48.319 --> 00:19:49.839
Investigate secretly

00:19:50.759 --> 00:19:53.359
If you find anything suspicious

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.640
find a way to test him

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.480
Understood

00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:06.920
Mr. Sakae asked me to thank you

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.400
Working for Mr. Sakae

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.799
you won't be shortchanged

00:20:11.119 --> 00:20:12.319
I don't want the money anymore

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.759
I'll owe you whatever is owed

00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:17.480
I will pay you back

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.519
Don't be too impulsive

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:22.119
Cut the crap

00:20:22.119 --> 00:20:23.559
From now on

00:20:23.559 --> 00:20:25.559
we go our separate ways

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.200
Let's pretend we never met

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.720
Alright

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.400
Then I'll take these things right now

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.039
and send them to Mr. Ye

00:20:36.039 --> 00:20:37.079
see what he has to say

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.920
Believe it or not, I will

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.480
shoot you right now

00:20:43.759 --> 00:20:45.799
The great name of Sakae Sawasaku

00:20:45.799 --> 00:20:47.599
surely you must have heard of it

00:20:48.839 --> 00:20:49.400
Do you think

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.960
he would let you off easily?

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.160
Don't burn your bridges

00:21:01.079 --> 00:21:03.599
Anything related to Master Geng

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.200
even if you beat me to death

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.240
I won't do it again

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.359
Actually, it's not that complicated

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:11.960
You just have to help us

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.480
do one last thing

00:21:14.119 --> 00:21:16.039
Not only will your previous gambling debts be written off

00:21:16.839 --> 00:21:17.559
I guarantee that in the future

00:21:17.559 --> 00:21:18.880
we won't come to trouble you again

00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:37.319
What is it?

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.519
Between Anlan Hall and Sanzao Island, there has always been

00:21:43.519 --> 00:21:45.759
a secret communication channel

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.480
Mr. Sakae hopes you

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.160
can help him find it as soon as possible

00:21:50.119 --> 00:21:51.240
Just this one thing

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.759
Just this one thing

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.799
New stock has arrived

00:22:16.359 --> 00:22:17.480
Master Duo

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.279
Let Xiang'er have a smoke with you

00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:23.359
All you care about is money

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.000
Get out

00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.640
Dad

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.200
Uncle sent a letter

00:23:02.599 --> 00:23:03.240
What does it say?

00:23:03.559 --> 00:23:04.960
Uncle asked about lifting the sea ban

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.519
The news has even reached Macau

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:12.640
Yes

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.039
He asked in great detail

00:23:14.119 --> 00:23:14.759
Lifting the sea ban

00:23:14.759 --> 00:23:16.079
what exactly is it about?

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.359
Who is allowed to go to sea?

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:18.519
What time to go to sea?

00:23:18.559 --> 00:23:19.079
After going to sea

00:23:19.079 --> 00:23:20.160
are there gunboats monitoring?

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.799
Don't be in a hurry to reply to your uncle

00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:25.240
Here

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.880
Take this letter

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.039
wait for your sister to come back

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:31.279
have her give it to Wumu

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:32.480
Let him take a look

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.759
I'll go find Tang Bingchen again

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.359
I've thought about this matter

00:23:39.799 --> 00:23:40.960
It's not that simple

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.079
You're finally back.

00:24:32.079 --> 00:24:32.640
Brother.

00:24:33.279 --> 00:24:34.160
How did it go?

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.200
Did you make up with Ju'er?

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.880
Why are you alone?

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:40.799
Where's Dad?

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.359
Dad took Granny Si

00:24:42.359 --> 00:24:43.200
to Tang Bingchen's house

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.640
to ask about fishing at sea.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:45.799
By the way.

00:24:45.799 --> 00:24:46.480
Look at this.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:46.559
Look at this.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.880
This is from today,

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.240
from my uncle's side,

00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:50.279
a letter from Macau.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.559
What does Uncle say?

00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:53.079
It's all in there.

00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:57.279
About lifting the sea ban,

00:24:57.599 --> 00:24:58.519
everyone in Macau already knows.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.200
Yes.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.400
How did the news spread so fast?

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.480
Oshima Hiroshi just left Macau,

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.599
and immediately everyone there knew.

00:25:05.599 --> 00:25:06.559
One right after the other.

00:25:07.519 --> 00:25:08.279
It seems this matter

00:25:08.279 --> 00:25:09.160
really is a conspiracy.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.119
If there is a conspiracy involved,

00:25:13.359 --> 00:25:14.559
you'll find out, right?

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.319
Ying'er.

00:25:16.319 --> 00:25:17.559
Don't worry just yet.

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:18.640
Wait for Dad to return,

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.599
and we'll have news.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.039
We originally planned to use the lifting of the ban

00:25:22.039 --> 00:25:23.359
to send the Major out.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.319
But now it seems,

00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:25.559
if it's Oshima Hiroshi's plot,

00:25:26.079 --> 00:25:27.279
we can't take that risk.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.920
You will handle it,

00:25:29.319 --> 00:25:30.200
right?

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.079
Wumu also understood

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.079
that lifting the sea ban

00:25:34.079 --> 00:25:35.519
could be a trap.

00:25:36.359 --> 00:25:37.880
The Eighth District Gang in Macau

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.079
would go to sea to save people no matter what.

00:25:40.759 --> 00:25:42.119
But his own mission

00:25:42.319 --> 00:25:44.119
was only to rescue The Believer,

00:25:44.119 --> 00:25:46.759
send back the code and radio beacon,

00:25:46.759 --> 00:25:48.839
and leave with Ye Biying.

00:25:49.119 --> 00:25:50.839
If he interfered in this matter,

00:25:50.839 --> 00:25:52.240
would it affect his

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.960
operations on the island?

00:25:54.599 --> 00:25:55.480
This afternoon,

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.160
Oshima Hiroshi returned from Macau.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.480
They've already brought people to perform an autopsy

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.839
on Inoue Kamakura's body.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.599
I believe starting tomorrow morning,

00:26:01.599 --> 00:26:02.920
the Special Police Brigade on the island

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.319
will launch a large-scale investigation.

00:26:04.519 --> 00:26:05.240
So tonight,

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.559
I must see Tang Ju'er.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.200
To ask clearly

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.000
about everything that happened at the hospital today.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.279
Okay.

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:11.160
I'll go call her now.

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:12.799
Don't let her dad know everything.

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:13.599
Don't worry.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.160
Excuse me.

00:26:53.799 --> 00:26:54.720
Please.

00:26:58.599 --> 00:26:59.480
Your Excellency.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.480
This afternoon,

00:27:01.759 --> 00:27:02.759
Oshima Hiroshi brought his men

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.720
and returned early from Macau.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.119
After he returned,

00:27:07.119 --> 00:27:08.079
what has he been doing?

00:27:08.759 --> 00:27:09.279
He's busy investigating

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:10.559
the cause of Deputy Captain Inoue's death.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.200
Did they find anything?

00:27:18.839 --> 00:27:20.279
Not yet.

00:27:21.559 --> 00:27:22.839
They requested the military hospital

00:27:22.839 --> 00:27:24.279
to perform an autopsy on the body.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.759
What was the cause of death?

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.079
I asked the military hospital.

00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:30.480
The cause of death is most likely

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.519
that Deputy Captain Inoue was driving drunk

00:27:31.519 --> 00:27:32.640
and caused an accident.

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:35.240
That man had

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.960
the habits of a Ronin all over him.

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:39.880
The Navy never welcomed that kind of officer anyway.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.160
Yes, sir.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.880
By the way,

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.279
after Captain Oshima Hiroshi returned,

00:27:45.279 --> 00:27:46.519
he ordered the execution of

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:48.920
a prisoner held in their custody.

00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:50.400
Who did he execute?

00:27:50.839 --> 00:27:52.079
That one from Tanjiawan Village,

00:27:52.079 --> 00:27:53.640
the old fortune teller.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.319
They say this old guy

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.640
had long predicted that Deputy Captain Inoue

00:27:58.839 --> 00:28:00.240
would die in a fire.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.720
Ignore them.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.319
Regarding the matter of Inoue Kamakura,

00:28:06.319 --> 00:28:07.480
Oshima Hiroshi is seeing red.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:08.079
Yes.

00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:09.960
He is a typical example of

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.759
someone who'd kill gods or Buddhas if they stood in his way.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.759
Your secret investigation into Oshima Hiroshi,

00:28:15.759 --> 00:28:16.920
is there a conclusion?

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.720
Not yet.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.200
We haven't found any link yet

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.559
between Captain Oshima and the Control Faction back home.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.480
What is the Colonel doing today?

00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:27.640
The Colonel...

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:29.319
he summoned a few

00:28:29.319 --> 00:28:30.039
officers who participated in

00:28:30.039 --> 00:28:31.480
the security detail for Admiral Ōkuni Mineo

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.559
for questioning.

00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:33.880
He is still continuing his investigation.

00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:36.039
Understood.

00:28:36.519 --> 00:28:37.559
Also,

00:28:37.559 --> 00:28:38.960
the additional

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.240
two patrol ships for Dahengqin Island have arrived.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.279
As per your instructions,

00:28:42.279 --> 00:28:43.039
they have been assigned to

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.559
the 56th Regiment on Dahengqin Island.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.480
In the next couple of days,

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.359
prepare to make a trip to Dahengqin Island.

00:28:50.359 --> 00:28:51.559
I understand.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.039
The Headquarters will not interfere

00:28:54.039 --> 00:28:55.839
with the investigation into Deputy Captain Inoue's death.

00:28:55.839 --> 00:28:57.880
We lost an officer,

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.920
and I also want to know the truth.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:00.960
Yes, sir.

00:29:06.519 --> 00:29:07.400
Elder.

00:29:09.279 --> 00:29:10.200
Come.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.240
Bingchen.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.599
I...

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.359
Elder,

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:22.319
that day,

00:29:23.119 --> 00:29:24.279
I drank too much.

00:29:24.519 --> 00:29:25.400
I lost my composure a bit.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.160
For any offense caused,

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.680
please forgive me, Elder.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.319
Can we go inside to talk?

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:34.839
Come.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.160
Bingchen,

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.000
regarding the matter of our children's marriage,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.759
let's put it aside for now.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.759
I came to find you today

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.119
to discuss something regarding

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:50.759
a major matter concerning the fate of everyone on the island.

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:52.000
A major matter.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.640
Yes.

00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:55.920
This lifting of the sea ban,

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.880
and going out to fish...

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.240
about this matter,

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.160
have you asked Interpreter Luo about it?

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.400
Seeing as

00:30:05.079 --> 00:30:06.359
the time is almost here.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.799
I have already asked.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.079
Interpreter Luo said that

00:30:12.359 --> 00:30:13.480
the Police Brigade

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.319
indeed handed a report

00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:16.720
over to Fujita.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.759
After Fujita received the report,

00:30:18.759 --> 00:30:20.519
he locked it directly in the safe.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.519
No one knows the specific content.

00:30:24.519 --> 00:30:25.960
No other news?

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.960
No.

00:30:29.119 --> 00:30:32.000
Fujita didn't mention

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.880
anything about this report to Interpreter Luo either.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.559
Did you sound him out?

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.680
Interpreter Luo said

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.640
lifting the sea ban should be a good thing.

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:42.920
There shouldn't be any big problems.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.759
A good thing?

00:30:47.559 --> 00:30:49.039
I don't think so.

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:50.559
If it's such a good thing,

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.359
why aren't there

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.400
any names from the Japanese Pioneer Group?

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.240
Why is it all our Chinese villagers?

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.119
And every one of them is an able-bodied man.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.799
Elder,

00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:03.640
could it be that you are

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.680
being too sensitive?

00:31:05.599 --> 00:31:07.160
How can I not be sensitive?

00:31:08.839 --> 00:31:10.640
We've already made a mistake once.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.599
Can we afford to make another one?

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.920
It won't be that serious, right?

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:17.240
The Japanese lifting the sea ban

00:31:17.559 --> 00:31:18.720
is also to improve

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.599
the lives of the people on the island.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.519
Bingchen,

00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:24.640
ever since our ancestors

00:31:25.319 --> 00:31:27.359
moved to this island,

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.160
their only thought

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.799
was how to survive,

00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:33.000
how to continue our line.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.880
So everyone on the island knows

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.599
that we must be in the same boat together.

00:31:37.599 --> 00:31:38.880
Everyone must stick together

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.400
to survive.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.240
So for the people on the island,

00:31:44.519 --> 00:31:45.519
human life

00:31:45.799 --> 00:31:47.200
is more important than anything else.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.680
A boat has but three inches of plank;

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.559
true feelings are revealed only in a storm.

00:31:53.079 --> 00:31:54.279
If they go out to sea this time

00:31:55.559 --> 00:31:57.279
and the folks don't come back,

00:31:59.359 --> 00:32:00.799
what do you say we do?

00:32:01.759 --> 00:32:03.240
The massacre was three years ago.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.079
The island

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.720
has been calm since then.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.319
This...

00:32:07.319 --> 00:32:10.200
the Japanese have no reason

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.400
to lay a vicious hand on the islanders again, right?

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.720
Bingchen, oh Bingchen.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.559
How can you think of the Japanese

00:32:17.559 --> 00:32:18.559
so favorably?

00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:19.319
So kind?

00:32:19.319 --> 00:32:21.160
Would they think on behalf of our fishermen?

00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:23.680
Would they?

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.400
Three years ago,

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.079
under the guise of issuing Good Citizen Certificates,

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.279
they told you to go door to door calling people out.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.880
And once you called them out,

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.119
they immediately carried out a massacre.

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:38.759
Now,

00:32:39.079 --> 00:32:40.880
now they have you beating drums and gongs...

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.880
Go organize the fishermen to head out to sea

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.640
Think about it yourself

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.400
This situation

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.839
compared to the last massacre

00:32:46.839 --> 00:32:47.880
what is the difference?

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.319
I'm telling you

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.960
if history repeats itself

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.279
you will be aiding a tyrant

00:32:55.279 --> 00:32:56.519
an unforgivable sinner

00:32:58.319 --> 00:32:58.960
Elder

00:32:59.759 --> 00:33:00.920
Then what should I do?

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.039
Regarding the lifting of the sea ban

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.119
you must get it clear

00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:11.920
Ask clearly

00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:13.480
whether on the list

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.079
everyone has to go to sea

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.079
When do they go out?

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.599
And after they go out

00:33:18.599 --> 00:33:20.000
are there patrol gunboats

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.079
following and monitoring them?

00:33:22.079 --> 00:33:22.960
If there are

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.640
then I am almost certain

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.119
this is definitely a massacre at sea

00:33:29.079 --> 00:33:29.920
Okay

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:31.039
Then

00:33:31.039 --> 00:33:33.839
I'll go ask Interpreter Luo again

00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:35.480
After all, he is Chinese

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.400
He wouldn't just watch trouble happen

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.400
and do nothing to save them, right?

00:33:39.799 --> 00:33:40.680
Bingchen

00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:42.880
I'm counting on you

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.640
Elder

00:33:46.319 --> 00:33:47.599
After the autopsy ended

00:33:47.599 --> 00:33:49.279
what conclusion did they reach?

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.640
They determined the time of death

00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:55.359
Thirteen hours ago

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.400
Between 4 and 5 PM yesterday

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.000
Which is when you were at the hospital

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.599
What else?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.079
Also

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.400
inside his tracheal wall

00:34:07.039 --> 00:34:09.199
there were no signs of inhaling smoke

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:10.280
That means

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.800
it was after he stopped breathing

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:14.880
that the motorcycle caught fire

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:17.599
So he didn't inhale any smoke

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.880
Also

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.039
Don't panic, what else?

00:34:23.039 --> 00:34:23.639
Also

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.000
Oh

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:28.119
they also said

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.679
they found alcohol in his stomach

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.159
Meaning he had been drinking

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:34.320
Go on

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.239
What else?

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.119
They said his cervical vertebrae were fractured

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.320
causing death by asphyxiation

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.719
But the doctor said

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.719
the possibility of a fall isn't ruled out

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.559
That's it

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:57.920
You are a doctor too

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.480
what do you make of this conclusion?

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.280
This isn't a concern

00:35:01.679 --> 00:35:03.039
There is another possibility

00:35:03.719 --> 00:35:04.519
Suppose Inoue

00:35:04.519 --> 00:35:06.079
when he fell from the cliff

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:07.599
landed head-first

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:08.599
it is possible

00:35:08.599 --> 00:35:10.320
that it caused his neck to break

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.400
and he died of asphyxiation

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.800
If he stopped breathing first

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.320
and the motorcycle caught fire afterwards

00:35:15.559 --> 00:35:16.599
it would explain

00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:17.800
why inside his trachea

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.719
no smoke was inhaled

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.239
This conclusion

00:35:22.239 --> 00:35:23.400
is very favorable to us

00:35:27.719 --> 00:35:28.960
Oshima Hiroshi knows

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.920
that after Inoue was bitten,

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.320
he came to the hospital.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.159
And his wound

00:35:35.559 --> 00:35:37.360
was treated by me.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.960
When you treated the wound,

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.800
was anyone else present?

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.400
Dr. Kozu.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.360
Tang Ju'er.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.960
From now on,

00:35:51.239 --> 00:35:52.400
I want you to calmly

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.679
listen to the rest of what I have to say.

00:35:53.679 --> 00:35:54.840
Is that okay?

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.559
Tomorrow morning,

00:35:58.559 --> 00:36:00.199
the Special Police Brigade will launch

00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:01.559
a large-scale investigation.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.039
Very soon,

00:36:03.239 --> 00:36:04.000
they will find

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.280
the person who bit Inoue.

00:36:05.559 --> 00:36:06.480
Then they will find out

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.599
that Inoue went to the base hospital.

00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:09.280
That time

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.400
was exactly around four or five in the afternoon.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.280
Which is when we were at the hospital.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.519
The time we were at the hospital

00:36:14.519 --> 00:36:16.760
coincides exactly with Inoue's time of death.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.000
This will become the main focus

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.320
of Oshima Hiroshi's investigation.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.360
Then what should we do?

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.400
Don't panic.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.400
They will also soon find out

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.039
that Inoue Kamakura was alive

00:36:26.039 --> 00:36:27.239
and riding his own motorcycle

00:36:27.239 --> 00:36:28.599
when he left the base hospital.

00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:29.400
On this point,

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.400
the sentry guards can testify.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.400
In this way,

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.400
the theory that the base hospital was

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.119
the primary scene of Inoue Kamakura's death

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:37.360
will not hold up.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:41.840
So the Special Police Brigade

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.679
will soon trace it

00:36:42.679 --> 00:36:43.880
to Ju'er?

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.679
Yes.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:45.840
Ju'er,

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.480
someone will definitely come to question you tomorrow.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.719
But if the person questioning you

00:36:49.719 --> 00:36:51.000
is not Oshima Hiroshi himself,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.639
but one of his officers,

00:36:52.639 --> 00:36:53.400
then we are halfway

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.719
to success.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.719
But...

00:36:57.559 --> 00:36:59.519
if the Japanese come to ask me,

00:37:00.159 --> 00:37:01.599
what should I say?

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.320
So it is best

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.079
that when they question you,

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:05.599
Dr. Kozu is present.

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:06.400
His testimony

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.079
will be of great help to you.

00:37:08.719 --> 00:37:10.159
Dr. Kozu...

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.960
Ju'er, don't be afraid.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.360
How about this.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.239
I will go to the hospital tomorrow too.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.360
You cannot go.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.360
If you go,

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.519
it would be protesting too much.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.000
Then what about you?

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.079
I will go.

00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:22.719
I will take

00:37:22.719 --> 00:37:24.519
officers from the Anti-Aircraft Battery with me.

00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:26.119
In the Battle of Huangyang Mountain,

00:37:26.119 --> 00:37:27.400
many soldiers from the Anti-Aircraft Battery

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.559
were wounded.

00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:29.119
So my going there

00:37:29.119 --> 00:37:30.360
to visit them is very reasonable.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.679
Won't this attract

00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:33.360
the attention of the Special Police Brigade?

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.960
That is exactly what I want to do.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.800
To draw their attention

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.079
entirely onto myself.

00:37:37.079 --> 00:37:37.960
This way,

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.360
it will reduce the focus on the Major

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.760
and on Ju'er.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.239
Ju'er,

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.360
have you remembered everything I said?

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.840
You should do it like this

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.119
Idiot

00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:09.840
Are you out of your mind

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.840
I'm sorry

00:38:11.239 --> 00:38:12.679
You can't even do this simple thing right

00:38:14.639 --> 00:38:16.199
You should place it like this

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.360
Do you know that Inoue is already dead

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.360
I'm sorry

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.039
What on earth are you thinking

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.639
What on earth are you thinking

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.880
Captain, calm down

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.760
Get out, quick

00:38:31.039 --> 00:38:32.039
Get out, quick

00:38:32.519 --> 00:38:33.039
Yes, sir

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.719
Yes, sir

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.119
Captain

00:38:46.119 --> 00:38:47.400
You should get some rest

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.760
Sasaki

00:38:56.559 --> 00:38:58.559
What do you make of these photos

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.400
It's absolutely impossible

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.159
One person could never do this alone

00:39:13.559 --> 00:39:18.400
How did it come to this

00:39:22.639 --> 00:39:23.960
Sasaki

00:39:26.519 --> 00:39:28.599
This is our most dangerous moment

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.079
We must maintain

00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:33.920
the highest level of vigilance

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.199
Yes, sir

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:23.079
What are you doing

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.280
Stop drinking

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.679
Will drinking more solve the problem

00:40:29.639 --> 00:40:31.039
Just leave me alone

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Dad

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.880
I know why you're upset

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.480
Listen to Ju'er this once

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.559
Don't go down the wrong path again

00:40:44.039 --> 00:40:46.199
Do you think I want to go down the wrong path

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.719
I'm afraid something will happen

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.519
Just like last time

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.559
If that really happens

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.639
how could we father and daughter have the face

00:40:57.639 --> 00:40:59.480
to stay on this island

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.960
I, your dad, would really

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.719
become a sinner for all eternity

00:41:08.119 --> 00:41:09.599
Then don't go anymore

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.639
I don't want to go

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.880
But will the Japanese let me off

00:41:20.719 --> 00:41:21.880
Ju'er

00:41:23.519 --> 00:41:24.920
Go back to your room and rest

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.000
Let Dad be alone for a while

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.800
Okay

00:41:34.239 --> 00:41:35.239
Go on

00:42:08.599 --> 00:42:09.760
Captain Inoue

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.960
likely before the motorcycle burned

00:42:12.119 --> 00:42:14.199
was already dead

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.239
He died thirteen hours ago

00:42:19.519 --> 00:42:23.760
Probably around four or five yesterday afternoon
