WEBVTT

00:00:07.687 --> 00:00:09.006
I want to see

00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:10.527
who's bullying my sister.

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:14.406
You are Li Shujing's brother?

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:16.925
I had no idea she had a brother.

00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:18.366
Well, now you do.

00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:19.527
My name is Liang Yusheng.

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.527
Give that project back to my sister.

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:23.086
Consider it

00:00:23.527 --> 00:00:24.686
a favor I owe you.

00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:25.886
Kid,

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.886
how much do you think
your favor is worth?

00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:29.846
What do you mean, kid?
That sounds awful.

00:00:29.847 --> 00:00:31.406
Are you helping or not?

00:00:33.406 --> 00:00:34.166
As for me,

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.807
I only help friends.

00:00:37.207 --> 00:00:39.646
If you can drink with me
until I am satisfied,

00:00:39.686 --> 00:00:41.566
I'll treat you as a friend.

00:00:59.575 --> 00:01:00.520
(Mijing Club)

00:01:21.527 --> 00:01:22.446
Not bad.

00:01:22.647 --> 00:01:24.967
You can hold your liquor better
than your sister.

00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:27.687
Do not call me kid.

00:01:28.326 --> 00:01:30.086
Do not speak badly about my sister.

00:01:30.087 --> 00:01:32.047
Why are you still so worked up?

00:01:32.287 --> 00:01:34.407
Come on, let us go somewhere else.

00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:46.779
=Secret By My Name=

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.574
(Adapted from the novel
Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:49.566
=Episode 6=

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:50.446
Shujing.

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:08.327
That woman...

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:11.327
You're back.

00:02:12.167 --> 00:02:13.286
Yeah.

00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:18.406
Where did you go last night?

00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:19.767
Nowhere.

00:02:20.167 --> 00:02:22.887
The problem with Lin Xi
might be settled.

00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:26.406
What?

00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:30.567
The problem with Lin Xi

00:02:30.887 --> 00:02:33.047
might be resolved.

00:02:35.967 --> 00:02:38.447
Tan Jianfei turned out
to be decent enough.

00:02:38.727 --> 00:02:40.325
He handled this fairly properly.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.887
What are you talking about?

00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:43.727
What does this have to do
with Tan Jianfei?

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:46.487
It was me.

00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:48.567
You dealt with Lin Xi?

00:02:49.407 --> 00:02:51.287
Yes... I did.

00:02:53.447 --> 00:02:54.366
What?

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.646
What is this?

00:02:59.727 --> 00:03:01.487
This is nothing.

00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:03.926
Yusheng!

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:06.560
You did not use that kind of method,
did you?

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.487
What kind of method?

00:03:14.766 --> 00:03:16.360
I won't take advantage of you
for nothing.

00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:18.406
The project is yours.

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:20.887
I'm off.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:27.806
I'm leaving.

00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:33.167
Goodbye.

00:03:34.287 --> 00:03:35.287
Don't go.

00:03:37.206 --> 00:03:38.167
What?

00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:40.607
Do you want me to take responsibility?

00:03:41.847 --> 00:03:45.007
Kid.

00:03:45.407 --> 00:03:46.646
I mean,

00:03:47.687 --> 00:03:49.207
you have to keep your word.

00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:52.047
Of course I will.

00:04:03.486 --> 00:04:04.926
Ms. Li is impressive.

00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:07.007
You managed to take care of Lin Xi.

00:04:16.486 --> 00:04:18.487
You were quite impressive
last night too.

00:04:26.607 --> 00:04:27.846
There are so many people around.

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:31.526
Wait for me.

00:04:38.567 --> 00:04:40.046
Since Lin Xi is gone,

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:43.126
let's hand over
the Autumn Winter Alpine project

00:04:43.127 --> 00:04:45.166
to Ms. Li Shujing.

00:04:47.247 --> 00:04:48.246
Miss Li,

00:04:48.247 --> 00:04:49.446
can you handle it independently?

00:04:49.447 --> 00:04:52.007
Mr. Zheng,
what do you consider independent?

00:04:52.047 --> 00:04:53.366
Like your department,

00:04:53.367 --> 00:04:55.560
independently creating
a three-hundred-million financial hole?

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.325
Or like me,

00:04:56.326 --> 00:04:58.486
turning that hole into leverage
to acquire a competitor?

00:04:58.487 --> 00:04:58.845
You!

00:04:58.846 --> 00:04:59.726
Enough.

00:05:00.807 --> 00:05:02.127
Ms. Li can do it.

00:05:33.286 --> 00:05:34.447
I have faith in her.

00:05:48.687 --> 00:05:52.046
Is there something going on
between Shujing and Jianfei?

00:05:52.487 --> 00:05:56.086
Ms. Li might have been
with Mr. Tan last night...

00:06:01.607 --> 00:06:02.526
Say it.

00:06:02.726 --> 00:06:04.366
Miss Li's earring

00:06:04.367 --> 00:06:05.566
was left last night

00:06:05.567 --> 00:06:08.046
in the corner of Mr. Tan's bedroom.

00:06:08.127 --> 00:06:10.086
It was turned in by housekeeping
this morning.

00:06:16.047 --> 00:06:17.367
They were together all night.

00:06:17.846 --> 00:06:19.845
Do you think it is possible

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:22.846
they were discussing
the Autumn Winter Alpine

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.406
embroidery stitching?

00:06:24.846 --> 00:06:26.606
Probably. Yes, probably.

00:06:30.846 --> 00:06:32.327
Probably?

00:06:34.766 --> 00:06:36.247
Probably.

00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:38.327
Get lost!

00:06:56.406 --> 00:06:57.606
Ms. Li's waist-shaping cut

00:06:57.607 --> 00:06:59.046
is still as sharp as ever.

00:06:59.646 --> 00:07:00.807
However,

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:03.046
the curve seems to be off by

00:07:03.047 --> 00:07:04.606
half a millimeter more than before.

00:07:07.646 --> 00:07:09.046
Then perhaps

00:07:09.047 --> 00:07:10.447
you should switch tailors.

00:07:10.487 --> 00:07:12.965
After all, for someone
who can't button a shirt

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:15.086
to misjudge measurements

00:07:15.526 --> 00:07:16.367
is hardly surprising.

00:07:17.846 --> 00:07:20.127
Then there is no one
more suitable than you.

00:07:20.247 --> 00:07:22.646
After all, there is no one else
in this world

00:07:23.326 --> 00:07:24.726
who understands me better.

00:07:24.927 --> 00:07:25.926
We are at the office.

00:07:25.927 --> 00:07:26.927
Step back.

00:07:28.286 --> 00:07:30.567
Mr. Tan, you seem to
have plenty of free time lately.

00:07:31.406 --> 00:07:34.406
Dropping by to tell your sister-in-law
how to do her job.

00:07:35.607 --> 00:07:37.406
Zuoyan, that is a bit premature.

00:07:37.726 --> 00:07:39.406
The wedding date isn't set yet.

00:07:39.646 --> 00:07:40.845
No one knows

00:07:40.846 --> 00:07:42.247
what will happen.

00:07:42.846 --> 00:07:43.846
Is that so?

00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:51.367
I came today

00:07:51.406 --> 00:07:53.085
to discuss the wedding date

00:07:53.086 --> 00:07:54.526
with Shujing.

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:55.726
Shujing,

00:07:56.526 --> 00:07:57.927
how about next month?

00:07:58.007 --> 00:07:59.046
What do you think?

00:08:03.286 --> 00:08:05.085
We'll discuss personal matters
in private.

00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:06.646
This is the office.

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:10.127
That is my Ms. Li,

00:08:10.447 --> 00:08:11.966
always so devoted to work.

00:08:14.086 --> 00:08:15.205
Zuoyan,

00:08:15.206 --> 00:08:16.606
perhaps you should not stay here,

00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:18.367
interrupting us
while we discuss work details.

00:08:26.286 --> 00:08:27.247
Shujing,

00:08:27.726 --> 00:08:28.807
come with me somewhere.

00:08:32.326 --> 00:08:33.247
Alright.

00:08:37.406 --> 00:08:38.486
Where are you going?

00:08:39.487 --> 00:08:40.766
That's none of your business.

00:08:45.847 --> 00:08:47.447
Button up.

00:09:08.926 --> 00:09:10.486
Does this piano's

00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:13.807
soundboard crack

00:09:14.406 --> 00:09:17.086
remind you of the sound

00:09:17.127 --> 00:09:18.886
of your dad's throat cracking
when he died?

00:09:21.007 --> 00:09:22.246
Talk!

00:09:23.686 --> 00:09:25.086
Where did you hide it?

00:09:25.926 --> 00:09:26.807
Hide what?

00:09:29.727 --> 00:09:31.687
In B flat.

00:09:33.327 --> 00:09:34.685
Li

00:09:34.686 --> 00:09:37.766
put everything he had

00:09:38.127 --> 00:09:40.567
on the seventh note.

00:09:41.286 --> 00:09:42.086
You monster!

00:09:42.087 --> 00:09:43.486
Let go of my mom!

00:09:43.487 --> 00:09:45.567
Let go of my mom!

00:09:49.247 --> 00:09:50.606
Monster?

00:09:51.487 --> 00:09:53.486
When your dad knelt and begged me,

00:09:53.487 --> 00:09:55.766
he was far more obedient than that.

00:09:59.686 --> 00:10:02.126
Your habit of rummaging through
old houses

00:10:02.127 --> 00:10:04.447
is far more honest
than the way you talk business.

00:10:12.327 --> 00:10:13.647
The Li family's debt,

00:10:13.967 --> 00:10:15.287
the Tan family's blood,

00:10:15.646 --> 00:10:17.527
and that thin,

00:10:17.607 --> 00:10:19.327
unspoken game

00:10:19.847 --> 00:10:22.726
of using each other between you and me

00:10:23.727 --> 00:10:26.687
are almost being erased by Tan Jianfei.

00:10:27.046 --> 00:10:28.846
Have you forgotten

00:10:29.806 --> 00:10:32.327
how to carve hatred into your bones?

00:10:32.566 --> 00:10:34.647
That's something
I never needed to be taught.

00:10:35.646 --> 00:10:37.445
Unlike the Tan family.

00:10:37.446 --> 00:10:39.687
You actually check the family records

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.407
before you start crying
at the funeral.
