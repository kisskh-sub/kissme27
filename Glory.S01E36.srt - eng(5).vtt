00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.750
[Glory]

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.910
[Episode 36]

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.430
It was me.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.539
I was the one who killed Xue Shuyu.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.950
You wicked woman!

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.430
I knew it was you!

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.870
Madam,

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.070
don't speak rashly out of anger.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.530
You can't just
confess to crimes recklessly.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.370
Xue Maotang.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.130
You've neglected me for 20 years.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.289
Now that I've killed one of your sons,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.630
it's actually letting you off easily.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.110
It's just that back then,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.910
I should have

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.000
killed this honey-tongued

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.829
and evil-hearted

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.970
woman, too.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.490
I didn't expect that

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.710
she would turn into a venomous snake today

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.680
and bite me back.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.320
I shouldn't have pitied you at that time.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.750
I pitied you
for being a widow as a young girl,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.550
so I often showed you extra care.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.920
Just let it be.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.150
I was truly as blind as a bat.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.690
It was my own fault
for misjudging this woman.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.120
I am...

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.000
the real blind one here.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.750
At this point,

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.520
I'll let you decide what to do to me.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.190
But we've been husband and wife
for many years,

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.430
and I know a big secret

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.750
about Your Highness.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.870
I suppose trading this secret

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.190
for my own life

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.390
would still be worthwhile.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.250
Stop playing tricks here.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.530
Do you think I would trust you?

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.030
Don't you want to know

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.400
why Madam Han passed away
in her prime years,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.030
being unable to wait for your

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.490
triumphant return?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.520
Tell me.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.100
Your Highness!

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.570
Your Highness!

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.750
Your Highness!

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.680
-Madam!
-Madam!

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.370
Your Highness!

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.390
Hurry! Hurry!

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.210
Hurry up!

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.329
Your Highness!

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.610
Your Highness!

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.370
Endure the pain! Endure the pain!

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.000
Madam!

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.280
Xue Maotang!

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.240
So you know the pain, too?

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.080
Hurry up!

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.680
How I wish I could...

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.240
Hurry up!

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.030
How I wish I could

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.600
bite your entire ear off!

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.570
For these 20 years,

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.410
you've resented and hated me

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.340
while I've been painstakingly
managing the household

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.340
for you.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.220
But you couldn't see it.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.870
Nor could you hear it!

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.740
For these 20 years,

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.990
I've sacrificed so much for you.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.890
But in the end,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.360
you, Xue Maotang,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.720
wouldn't even give me

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.310
a house to live in.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.040
And now,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.810
you actually want to...

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.600
you actually want to frame me

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.040
and kill me.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.600
If you want me to die,

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.510
I can die.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.600
But I refuse

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.120
to die like your Madam Han,

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.960
who passed away silently without a trace!

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.870
Even till now, you still don't know

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.750
how Madam Han died, do you?

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.040
She was...

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.500
She was worn down by you to death.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.540
Your houseful of concubines made her

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.110
so angry that she died!

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.890
If you want me to die today,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.370
I'll die in front of you.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.220
But let me tell you.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.080
We are all human beings.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.360
We are not stones.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.270
Nor are we tools!

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.040
We are living people!

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.190
I would laugh and cry.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.920
I would also be weak sometimes.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.000
And I have feelings, too!

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.480
Fine.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.270
You want to die?

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.330
I'll grant your wish!

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.720
Come on!

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.720
Come on!

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.560
Your Highness!

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.000
No!

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.890
Don't do this!

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.830
Step aside!

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.780
Your Highness!

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.360
She's a second-rank titled lady.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.630
No matter what crimes she has committed,

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.280
she must be tried according to the law.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.440
Your Highness, do you really

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.430
want to kill a titled lady illegally?

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.600
You rebellious son!

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.600
She killed your own brother
with her plots.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.950
Are you still trying to help her

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.150
harm your own father?

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.680
Step aside!

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.140
You brute!

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.480
Bad news!

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.530
Miss Sun...

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.500
Miss Sun fell into the lake!

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:44.510
Good child.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.610
Go find your mother.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.900
Mother!

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.310
Yu, are you alright?

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.000
Aunt's little dog

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.560
fell into the pond just now.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.070
I wanted to pull it out,

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.430
but I carelessly fell into the pond.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.040
Xiu Qiong.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.680
Luckily, Miss Rong was passing by

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.800
and pulled me out.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.650
Fortunately, the dog is fine, too.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.020
I'm glad you're both fine.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.200
As a mother,

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.120
one should

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.800
set a good example for her children.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.510
Murder and false accusations

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.950
are things that we shouldn't

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.410
let the children witness.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.430
Mrs. Xue,

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.830
you'd better ask someone

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.430
to escort Miss Sun back home.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.440
Lian Xin, hurry!

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:35.960
Yes.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:37.850
Come on.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.710
The sea of suffering is boundless,

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.630
but salvation awaits those who turn back.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.760
Princess Jinxiang,

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.030
was he

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.750
truly killed by the duke's wife?

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.460
Miss Rong.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.730
You're truly impressive.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.680
I did it.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.160
Xue Shuyu

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.180
was killed by me.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.680
Yingchuan, you...

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.150
Why did you do that?

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.830
I originally planned

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.730
to blame everything on Mother.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.320
After all, Father didn't care for her,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.510
and she was already terminally ill.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:39.870
Madam.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.200
So what if she takes the blame

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200
for all my crimes?

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.510
Who knew

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.630
she would be so strong-willed

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.650
and cause such big trouble?

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.790
Now I feel a bit guilty instead.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.390
I don't understand.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.220
You were obviously on such good terms

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:58.880
with Shuyu.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.240
Why did you...

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.850
Others may not know,

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.010
but don't you know, Father?

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.670
You certainly know.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.340
Back then,

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.240
you personally ordered

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.870
Xue Shuyu to take some men

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.440
to capture Mr. Wang and me.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.080
Then you sent him

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.080
to the most dangerous battlefield,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.150
causing him to die in a battle there.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.480
You also took my newborn daughter

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.790
away from me.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.510
She was only 7 days old!

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.600
Just 7 days old!

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.240
Your purpose was just to

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.270
quickly force me into

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.080
another man's bridal sedan.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.910
I cried and begged.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.180
But you all refused to spare me.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.120
You are my own father.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.890
My own younger brother did the same, too.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.250
No one was willing to spare me.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.880
Since you all wanted me to suffer,

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.200
then no one could live peacefully!

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.040
You...

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:12.920
You...

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.550
Xue Maotang!

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.080
Stop saying you.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.830
All the members of the family

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.660
have been forced by you into such a state.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.720
You're so nice.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.170
You all...

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.030
Your Highness!

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.830
Hurry! Hurry!
Take him back to the Baoshi Hall now!

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.730
Madam, your illness is severe,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.180
and you've been wrongfully accused.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:28.870
It's understandable that you're outraged

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.270
and acting impulsively.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.390
This is all because of the duke's
arbitrary actions that have harmed others.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.520
Please go back first

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.100
and focus on your recovery.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.120
As for Xue Yingchuan...

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.200
Ever since Yingchuan

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.170
lost her child,

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.210
she has been suffering from hysteria.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:00.920
Whenever she saw

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.320
Master Shuyu and the duke,

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.390
she would always talk about killing them.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.650
She hasn't had an relapse for many years.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.790
I thought she had fully recovered.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.750
But seeing her today,

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.200
I'm afraid she's having a relapse again.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:13.840
Otherwise, how would she

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.970
be unable to recognize her own brother

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.200
and even kill him?

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.320
The duke

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.900
probably cannot make a decision now.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.630
Sending the culprit to the police
would be inappropriate.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.440
After all, the duke

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.240
cares deeply about his reputation.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.460
With his wife's and children's
resentment and madness,

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.270
which might cause a scene in court,

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.670
wouldn't it become a laughingstock
of the entire city?

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:39.480
You'd better

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.100
handle this problem at your discretion.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.110
She indeed suffers from hysteria,

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.370
but murder is such a serious crime
that she can't be pardoned.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.370
Send her to the family temple first,

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.170
and find a doctor to treat her.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.720
When her illness is cured,

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.900
she will face punishment for murder.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.350
What are you all waiting for?

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.370
Although Ji Ping

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.550
also tampered with the brazier,

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.820
she's not the main culprit after all.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.270
How should we deal with her?

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.800
Though she didn't kill him,

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.260
she did put the Valley Lily into it.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:23.910
Send her to

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.510
the estate outside the city.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.400
Sentence her
to five years of penal servitude.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.160
Jianglai, Miss Rong,

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:32.480
thank you

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.080
for upholding justice here.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.390
Now that the truth has been uncovered,

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.520
Master Shuyu can finally rest in peace

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.720
in the netherworld.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.720
It's just that the duke

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.550
cannot manage affairs for the time being.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.210
From now on,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.220
this grand Duke of Yongguo's Mansion

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.770
will depend entirely
on your care, Jianglai.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:16.320
Huiqing.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.080
Shuyu's death...

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.710
You may leave now.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.550
If there's anything in here

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.600
that you like,

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:19.910
just take it.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.000
Such nice knee pads.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.980
Does Madam not want them anymore?

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.030
Yeah.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.050
From now on, these items

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.120
will never be used again.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.530
Your Highness.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.870
Your Highness! Your Highness!

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:27.930
Please be careful.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.180
Your Highness.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.390
The liver is the organ of wind and wood.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.480
Irritability and rage
would cause internal liver wind,

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.120
and your stroke would become worse.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.360
Even the greatest immortals

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.690
couldn't save you then.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.320
I don't need a doctor.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:40.150
Get out!

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.660
Ask Jianglai to come here.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.630
Just go!

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.510
Last night,

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.319
my brother apologized to me.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:29.110
I thought

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.000
we would still
have much time together in the future.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:35.670
Jianglai.

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.530
Master Shuyu's death...

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:45.580
Don't say it.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.710
Don't say anything.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.800
Alright.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.520
Let's both remain muddle-headed.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.030
Master Jianglai.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.440
Your Highness,
why have you summoned me here?

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.840
You don't need to
be so alert to everything.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.410
I'm not trying to argue with you here.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.420
I used to believe

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.590
a real man
should aspire to conquer the world

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.600
rather than worry about household matters.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.530
Only until now have I realized that

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:37.840
in this household,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.830
everyone resents me.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.720
I'm a bad husband

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.000
and a bad father.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.110
As for your brother's incident,

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.790
I don't want to pursue it anymore.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.030
It's up to you

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:50.960
how to handle it.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.480
Tomorrow, I'll submit a memorial,

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.740
asking His Majesty

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.920
to let you be the duke's heir

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.160
so that you can rightfully
return to our family.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.070
When I can walk again,

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.400
let's

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:05.050
go to Jiangnan personally

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.880
to move your mother's grave back here.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.350
Though I know it's too late,

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.030
it might at least slightly make up for

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.200
the guilt in my mind

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.920
and your regrets.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.900
What exactly do you want, Your Highness?

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:28.520
Just speak frankly.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.640
I'm getting old now.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.720
My shoulders can no longer bear

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.650
the weight of this Duke's Mansion.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.300
From now on,

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:42.370
I'd like to entrust the Xue family

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.400
and this child

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.400
to you.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.160
Xun.

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.370
Go bow to your Uncle Jianglai.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.130
Uncle Jianglai.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.410
No need for this.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.450
Your Highness.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.310
The person who you should apologize to
has passed away.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.110
Why do you have to put on this act?

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.850
I'm sorry but I can't stay with you.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.930
Uncle Jianglai, don't go!

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.640
If you insist on leaving,

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.920
I know I can't keep you here.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:25.830
However,

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.110
please think more about

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.880
this child.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.120
He's only 7 years old.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.880
Forcing him to bear such a heavy burden

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.790
will certainly

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.990
crush his young and fragile shoulders.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.750
I know I'm not a good father.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.670
I've failed to
educate your brother properly.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:42.750
But can you bear to watch

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.960
his only child

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.480
also emulating him

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.510
in the future?

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.880
Uncle Jianglai, don't go!

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.070
Father is dead.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.100
I'm so scared.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.370
Could you please

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.480
stay with me?

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.480
Uncle Jianglai!

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.750
I'm begging you!

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.440
Uncle Jianglai!

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.590
Uncle Jianglai!

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.820
Uncle Jianglai!

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.350
[Imperial Yongguo Mansion]

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.000
Wait!

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.590
Yu.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:53.680
Your auntie is leaving.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.880
Go say goodbye to her.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.790
Auntie.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:04.370
Stay away from me.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.640
Don't live like I did.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.740
All of you, put these away properly.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:54.490
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.110
Yes.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.970
Your Highness.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.010
Clean up everything

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.070
in the courtyard.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.510
Don't leave any old items here.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.960
Yes.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.350
I will make an inventory of them all

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.080
and put them in the storehouse.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.820
There's no need for such trouble.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.050
Just burn them all.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:27.690
Your Highness.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.590
The Chi Dragon Pendant in this place

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.200
was fastened to Master Shuyu's waist

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.960
by you personally
during his coming-of-age ceremony.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.790
I noticed that

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.880
Master Shuyu had kept it

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.240
in a precious brocade box.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:36.830
I wonder

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.350
how to deal with it.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.890
You've reminded me something.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.500
At Jianglai's coming-of-age ceremony,

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.450
I didn't give him anything.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:50.720
Go to the storehouse

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.720
and select the finest piece of jade.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:55.750
Yes.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.030
You may leave now.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.240
Yes.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:52.920
Lady Shanbao.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.030
Lady Yunshu said

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.960
she would
personally escort you to the dock.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.090
Shall we depart now?

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.480
I got it.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:24:59.960
Wait!

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.150
Rong Shanbao.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.610
What do you mean?

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:04.880
Are you leaving now?

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:06.640
Are you really going to

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.770
leave me alone here?

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.760
What exactly do you mean?

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.180
Tell me, Rong Shanbao!

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.510
You two may leave now.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:17.720
Yes.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.300
I'm talking to you.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.040
Jianglai.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.790
Listen to me.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.330
The Duke of Yongguo

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.350
was once

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.040
a devoted husband
who quite cherished his first wife.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.590
He withstood family pressure

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:44.920
for his infertile wife.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.030
Though she passed away many years ago,

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.760
he still hasn't forgotten her.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.920
Before my father came to the capital,

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.450
he also had lofty ambitions

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.740
with high spirits.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:55.830
He aspired to be

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.720
a good official
that would be remembered in history.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.850
They weren't born to be so detestable,

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.440
but as time went by,

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.920
they became so different from
what they had been.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.510
You have your Duke's Mansion

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:07.710
and family ties that you can't let go of.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.440
I don't hope to watch you

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.480
become the arbitrary

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:13.590
and annoying

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.830
Duke of Yongguo one day.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.420
Rong Shanbao.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.750
You and I will stop here.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.410
In my mind, you will

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.270
forever be that upright
and determined man,

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.000
who never curries favor
with the powerful men

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.420
and always remains wise, decisive,

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.620
clever and adorable,

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.460
just like the way you were
when we first met.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:31.590
So,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.160
please let me leave.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.360
Let our memories

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:37.880
stay on this day

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.210
when I love you the most.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:40.640
What if I don't allow it?

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.210
Will you still continue
to look for a husband?

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.610
I have my own responsibilities.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.250
But I will never forget you.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:01.680
In this lifetime,

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:04.480
my love will never change until death.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.680
The Rong family's carriage
is already waiting outside.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.080
Are you really going to
let Miss Rong leave?

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.110
I was even waiting for you

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.350
to go back to Linji with me

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.480
to achieve the aspirations
of eradicating corruption

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.010
and benefiting the people.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.880
It turns out that I've waited in vain.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.440
The humble position of Prefect of Linji

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.350
can hardly compare with

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.160
this grand and luxurious Duke's Mansion.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.890
She has long intended to leave.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.440
On the first day

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.640
when she arrived at the Duke's Mansion,

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:48.350
she knew

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.480
this day would come.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:58.270
How can there be

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.330
such a heartless woman in this world?

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.920
Even when she's saying goodbye to you,

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:03.830
she still wouldn't forget to use

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:05.760
the sweetest words to deceive you,

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.680
making you unable to forget her,

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.750
unwilling to hate her

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:09.590

Miss Rong,
do you have something to tell me?

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.760
Xuanyu

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:23.970
is Princess Jinxiang's
biological daughter.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.160
My child died at the time

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.030
of birth.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.920
I bribed those who worked for the duke

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.030
and dealt with the girl's servants.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.760
I secretly switched the babies.

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:39.740
Your grandfather
was the head of the Imperial Hospital.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:40.660
Mrs. Xue,

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.740
you must be skilled in medicine, too.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.160
The rumor of the men-only inheritance

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.560
is also groundless, huh?

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.510
I merely learned the skills
through observation.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:51.110
Those are some insignificant skills.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:54.110
How would I dare to boast about them
in front of others?

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.160
Miss Ji Ping

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:57.200
also wasn't really

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.790
at odds with you.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:00.750
That night,

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.480
you told me about your feelings

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.640
not because
we felt like old friends at first sight.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.440
You actually wanted to stall me.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.790
Lady Shanbao,
you've seen through everything.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.190
Why didn't you expose it?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.400
You didn't kill anyone
with your own hands.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.940
So what if I expose you?

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.880
Master Shuyu's cruelty
to his wife and concubines

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.080
is well-known to all.

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:23.170
As someone with a conscience,

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.510
Jianglai must be suffering the most

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:28.100
because while being stuck in the dilemma,

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.550
he has no choice but to
remain willfully ignorant like this.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.030
Only with all the endurance and plots

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.030
did you manage to get what you wanted.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.160
Are you truly happy?

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:37.350
Miss Rong,

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:39.680
not everyone has the luck

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.280
to be born in the Rong family.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:42.680
Also, not everyone has

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.610
the freedom to live as they please.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.600
I don't have
the Founding Emperor's jade seal.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:49.790
Nor do I have a powerful natal family

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:51.450
that's willing to support me.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.480
I don't even have

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.410
a husband that's worth relying on.

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:57.030
In this world,

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:58.960
there isn't even

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.890
a single person who truly loves me.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.850
But I must love myself.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.980
I must protect myself.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.490
And above all, I must protect my children.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.200
But I still have to thank you, Miss Rong.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.150
Thank you for never

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.880
exposing me in front of others,

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.000
and ugly.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.840

Stop talking.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.740
You're becoming a laughing stock.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:06.710
Then take me back home with you.

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:08.460

♪ How can such a fleeting grace
be forgotten? ♪

If you want to go back, just go back.

Let me carry you onto the ship.

♪ We found another crescent moon ♪

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.740
This is so inappropriate.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:25.940
Put me down right now.

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:35.910
When we reach Linji,

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.630
I won't allow you to be so impudent again.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:39.960
Then I'll listen to you, Lady Shanbao.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.220
Let's return to Linji.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.400
Mr. Lu!

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.800
Wait!

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:51.630
Mr. Lu!

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:53.290
I haven't boarded yet!

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:54.340
Wait!

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.960
Let's leave at once.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.510
The annoying men are coming.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:59.110
Set sail!

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.840
Wait!

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.710
Speaking of which, I wonder

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:18.770
who was so kind to me

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:20.590
and was afraid that I couldn't make it,

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:21.190
specially leaving

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:22.220
a fast horse to me.

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:23.550
Shut up!

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:26.890
You've chosen this path yourself.

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:27.680
You can't blame me now.
