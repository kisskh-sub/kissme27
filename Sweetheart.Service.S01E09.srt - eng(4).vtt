WEBVTT

00:00:54.711 --> 00:00:56.713
I'll be heading out now.

00:00:57.297 --> 00:00:58.423
Take care.

00:01:26.034 --> 00:01:29.287
JUNG Myeongcheol as Taeha

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.043
YOON Hyunkwon as Jaemin

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:41.424
LEE Suyeon as Suyeon

00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:47.764
LEE Jaehyeop as Minwoo

00:01:52.727 --> 00:01:55.980
KIM Hyunseo as Yooha

00:01:58.483 --> 00:02:02.070
"Sweetheart Service"

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:08.034
(Chapter 9: Scarlett O'hara)

00:02:19.128 --> 00:02:20.128
Taeha.

00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:25.677
The last bus isn't for a while…
Do you mind if I wait here?

00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:31.265
Huh?

00:02:32.517 --> 00:02:33.517
Sure.

00:02:43.862 --> 00:02:44.862
Jaemin.

00:02:46.656 --> 00:02:47.656
Yeah?

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:49.533
Should I…

00:02:50.952 --> 00:02:52.537
tell you a fun story?

00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:55.081
What is it?

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:15.310
It was a cold winter day.

00:03:16.394 --> 00:03:18.521
There was a boy, covered in bruises.

00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:29.157
The boy was always alone.

00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:31.743
He felt like…

00:03:32.327 --> 00:03:34.954
…the whole world had abandoned him.

00:03:39.626 --> 00:03:43.713
Then one day, an angel came and saved him.

00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:49.510
All the angel did was smile a little

00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:55.099
but that small smile melted all the cold
in his heart and body.

00:03:55.808 --> 00:03:57.393
It felt like being born again.

00:04:04.317 --> 00:04:11.407
But that angel had also been abandoned
by God, locked away and in pain.

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:16.589
When the boy saw that, he made up his mind.

00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:20.458
That he would never leave the angel alone.

00:04:21.417 --> 00:04:22.877
That he would always protect them.

00:04:38.267 --> 00:04:40.645
"This is the highest place in the world."

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.692
"If we're here…

00:04:47.151 --> 00:04:49.070
…no one can find us."

00:04:54.867 --> 00:04:59.372
And so the two became a family
and lived happily ever after.

00:05:17.765 --> 00:05:18.891
Jaemin~

00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:28.776
The last bus is about to leave.

00:05:35.408 --> 00:05:36.451
Taeha…

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:41.414
I have to go now!

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.791
Okay. See you tomorrow.

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:06.147
We're closed. Come back tomorrow.

00:06:40.348 --> 00:06:42.183
JAEMIN

00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:47.730
Hello?

00:06:47.731 --> 00:06:49.941
Yooha, have you heard from Taeha?

00:06:50.775 --> 00:06:51.775
Why?

00:06:52.068 --> 00:06:53.193
What's going on?

00:06:53.194 --> 00:06:57.572
Taeha didn't show up for work today.
I've been trying to call him but…

00:06:57.573 --> 00:06:58.990
He's not picking up.

00:06:58.991 --> 00:07:01.035
So I was wondering if he called you.

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:03.411
What?

00:08:28.497 --> 00:08:29.497
Jaemin.

00:08:30.708 --> 00:08:31.918
Where does this one go?

00:08:32.543 --> 00:08:33.878
That corner table!

00:08:55.524 --> 00:08:58.526
Here's your Long Island Iced Tea.

00:08:58.527 --> 00:08:59.569
Enjoy!

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.780
Whoa!

00:09:18.214 --> 00:09:20.382
You'll have it done by today, right?

00:09:20.383 --> 00:09:21.758
- Yes.
- Yes, I can.

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:22.927
Then…

00:09:24.011 --> 00:09:25.012
you can go.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.349
- Good work.
- Thanks for your work.

00:09:38.442 --> 00:09:39.485
Jeong Minwoo

00:09:40.027 --> 00:09:42.113
can we talk for a sec?

00:09:48.452 --> 00:09:50.204
Is something wrong?

00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:53.249
Actually…

00:09:53.833 --> 00:09:56.502
Things have been kind of messy lately…

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.965
My ex…

00:10:01.841 --> 00:10:05.261
he keeps calling me,
showing up at my place.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.555
It's been kind of scary.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.393
So I want to keep having
Yooha play my boyfriend.

00:10:13.394 --> 00:10:15.813
I'd like to keep hiring him for that.

00:10:21.027 --> 00:10:22.361
Yooha…

00:10:23.362 --> 00:10:24.655
he's a good person.

00:10:28.284 --> 00:10:30.410
It's because he's someone
Minwoo introduced me to.

00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:32.580
Otherwise I don't want
to find someone else.

00:10:33.664 --> 00:10:35.290
Honestly, that guy…

00:10:35.291 --> 00:10:36.459
he's pretty great.

00:10:43.674 --> 00:10:45.009
Oh, and one more thing.

00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:47.219
The project we're working on now...

00:10:47.511 --> 00:10:48.763
make sure it ends well.

00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:52.433
The investors are counting on it.

00:10:54.185 --> 00:10:55.519
What do you mean?

00:10:57.897 --> 00:11:01.484
I trusted you with it, so don't mess it up.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.110
Alright?

00:11:51.992 --> 00:11:53.494
Is the bar closed?

00:11:54.203 --> 00:11:55.204
Suyeon?

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.671
Yooha, I'll be back
after taking out the trash.

00:12:06.257 --> 00:12:07.425
Is something wrong?

00:12:08.259 --> 00:12:09.385
Ah…

00:12:10.219 --> 00:12:12.805
It's just… you didn't reply.

00:12:13.556 --> 00:12:17.518
And I remembered your
brother's bar, so I came by.

00:12:19.311 --> 00:12:21.188
But your brother's not here?

00:12:25.109 --> 00:12:26.109
No.

00:12:27.486 --> 00:12:28.779
Are you okay?

00:12:38.539 --> 00:12:39.790
Yooha…

00:12:40.791 --> 00:12:43.127
It's okay. You can talk to me.

00:12:49.508 --> 00:12:50.593
My brother…

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.638
He disappeared.

00:12:57.349 --> 00:12:59.351
He's missing?

00:13:04.565 --> 00:13:06.108
I don't know…

00:13:07.401 --> 00:13:09.904
Did you report it?

00:13:16.118 --> 00:13:17.161
So

00:13:19.914 --> 00:13:22.082
I'm running the bar for now.

00:13:25.085 --> 00:13:26.170
But

00:13:28.506 --> 00:13:31.842
a few days ago, I got a notice that

00:13:33.802 --> 00:13:35.429
this building is going up for auction.

00:13:39.099 --> 00:13:40.184
I…

00:13:43.443 --> 00:13:45.237
just can't let go of this place…

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.735
the bar my brother
worked so hard to protect.

00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:57.451
But… I don't think
there's anything I can do.

00:14:03.624 --> 00:14:04.750
Yooha

00:14:06.669 --> 00:14:08.379
I'll help you.

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:12.090
What?

00:14:12.216 --> 00:14:14.592
I'll support you financially.

00:14:14.593 --> 00:14:17.263
Enough to stop the auction.

00:14:17.888 --> 00:14:19.723
Even for operations.

00:14:21.892 --> 00:14:24.103
But there's one condition.

00:14:29.817 --> 00:14:32.444
Let's make a fake relationship
contract. You and me.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.994
Of course, the terms will be
much better than Minwoo's.

00:15:23.621 --> 00:15:24.955
Are you okay?

00:15:33.547 --> 00:15:35.627
I think I'll just stop
working part-time for a while

00:15:37.217 --> 00:15:39.303
and focus on the bar.

00:15:39.678 --> 00:15:42.306
No, I mean you.

00:15:43.932 --> 00:15:46.268
Are you ~really~ okay?

00:15:56.153 --> 00:15:58.113
I don't have another option.

00:16:03.744 --> 00:16:05.079
I'm okay.

00:17:05.264 --> 00:17:08.100
"Sweetheart Service"

00:17:08.308 --> 00:17:10.811
You want to keep watching us, right?
