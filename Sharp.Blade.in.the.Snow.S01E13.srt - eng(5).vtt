[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.950
[Episode 13]

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.610
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.920
You're the one insisting on protecting

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.080
that filthy slave.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.440
Get over here now!

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.200
I'm taking both this stone

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.160
and him.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.050
Come with me.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.840
Feng Li.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.520
Are you sure you want to take my stuff?

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.080
I am the ruler

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.600
while you are the subject.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.640
Even if I demanded your head today,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.759
you would have to offer it
with both hands.

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.820
How can you call it taking your stuff?

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.600
If you're still unsatisfied,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.530
go find your aunt
at the Princess Royal's residence.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.199
You're hurt.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.960
You'll get frostbite without shoes.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.480
Let me help you put them on.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.880
They all say I'm a bad seed

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.610
and a harbinger of misfortune.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.290
Aren't you afraid of me?

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.000
Why should I be afraid?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.160
You are my friend.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.600
No matter who you are,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.720
we will survive together.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.400
Come on.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.000
Have you ever seen

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.120
a little boy at this height

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.100
with a red dot on his forehead?

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.160
That guy

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.120
is a bastard from Dongli.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.940
He just escaped from our mine yesterday.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.040
This wasteland

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.680
is full of wild beasts.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.690
Once he's out there,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.560
it's impossible for him to survive.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.200
What?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.780
Are you afraid of pain?

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.440
I am just a lowly servant.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.120
How could I deserve
Your Majesty's personal care?

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.930
So, you are afraid of me, right?

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.640
I am not.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.040
It's just that...

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.080
Your Majesty, you seem to be
quite different

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.360
from the rumors.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.640
What am I like in those rumors?

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.840
It's said

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.880
that you are cruel and unpredictable,

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.340
killing without remorse.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.160
But in my eyes,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.000
you are a gentle person.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.210
Would you be willing to stay by my side?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.860
I have already given my heart to someone.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.800
I don't wish to use my appearance
to gain favor.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.040
Tell me

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.320
what kind of person she is.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.130
When I was young,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.360
I was stranded in the wasteland

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.120
where I met a little girl.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.600
We swore to be together forever.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.159
But later, due to some accidents,

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.960
I broke my promise.

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.490
Even the only token was stolen by thieves.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.000
Since then,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.300
I've never seen her again.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.520
No wonder the black jade ended up

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.650
with the courtesan.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.520
So, you mean

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.160
you want to reject me

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.240
for a woman

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.000
whose whereabouts are unknown?

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.850
All these years,

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.080
I've never given up looking for her.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.920
I believe

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.840
I will find her again.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.860
I want to fulfill the promise
we made when we were young.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.400
I won't let her get hurt again.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.930
[You've already found me.]

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.960
It's my fault.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.760
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.060
No, it's not like that.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.680
I was moved

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.840
by your story.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.240
What's your name?

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.680
I didn't have a name originally.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.120
Later,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.960
when I was adopted by my foster father,
who is a hunter,

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.280
he named me Xiao Ze.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.720
Xiao Ze.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.300
That's a good name.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.400
From now on,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.720
you'll stay by my side.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.280
Don't worry.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.760
I won't force you to do anything.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.360
I hope

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.440
you can find your little girl soon.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.560
I can never repay your kindness.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.760
I will be diligent

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.770
and serve you wholeheartedly.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.920
When you're with me from now on,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.250
don't take yourself as a servant anymore.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.800
I have a request

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.840
that I risk my life to ask.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.940
Your Majesty, please help me.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.159
Speak.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.320
That stone

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.520
is the only keepsake

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.890
that little girl gave me

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.240
when I was at the wasteland.

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:57.440
Your Majesty,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.800
please return that stone

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.240
to me.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.560
Keep it safe.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.120
Who exactly

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.320
sent this impostor

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.640
to approach her using my name?

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.840
Xiao Ze.

00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:01.020
Were you kicked out by Her Majesty

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.320
and lost your soul?

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.020
You can't even walk straight.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.050
Of course I'm not

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.720
as good at fawning on others as you,
Mr. Bai.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.980
What a waste of effort.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.490
Now that Her Majesty

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.980
has a new lover in her arms.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.290
She probably has no time for pastries.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.560
Seems you've truly fallen out of favor.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.440
You're nothing special after all.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.900
I'm still better than you,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.640
who never even had the chance
to lose her favor.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.080
By the way,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.300
that night,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.880
thanks for

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.679
your Phoenix Drunk wine.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.039
It finally let me experience

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.240
what it's like when Her Majesty

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.280
throws herself into my arms.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.210
What did you say?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.919
Not only do I know,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:41.919
but Her Majesty also knows

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.960
there was something wrong with that wine.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.220
She didn't punish you.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.200
It means you

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.360
are still something for her.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.130
You were with Li that night?

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.940
We were not only together,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.240
but we also...

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.680
I'll kill you!

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.880
You worthless slave!

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.980
Is this all you're capable of?

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.120
How can you protect Her Majesty?

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.880
Mr. Bai.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.760
You should be vigilant about

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.040
someone else.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.730
Instead of watching me all day,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.730
you'd better

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.680
check Her Majesty's chamber.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.180
If you're too late,

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.960
it will be all over.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.040
Your Majesty, it's time for your medicine.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.930
Just leave it there.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.920
Your Majesty,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.800
the physician said

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.600
if the medicine gets cold,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.000
it won't be effective.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.960
I'm afraid it's too hot.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.250
I'll drink it later.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.360
Your Majesty,

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.940
let me cool it down for you.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.160
Your Majesty,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.820
the medicine has cooled down.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.240
Get out of the way!

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.800
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.000
I'm perfectly fine.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:32.760
You worthless slave!

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.440
Bai.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.400
How dare you force medicine on
Her Majesty!

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.200
Bai.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.400
He was just trying to give me medicine.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.560
You were too rough.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.120
Are you hurt?

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.090
I'm okay.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.200
But

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.810
Your Majesty's medicine spilled.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.680
Your Majesty,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.320
the man with unclear origins

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.050
shouldn't be kept by your side.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.800
You're truly overthinking.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.840
Her Majesty saved me from dire straits,

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.080
so I owe her my life.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.690
I've long heard that

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.400
Mr. Bai and Her Majesty grew up together.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.280
If you dislike me,

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.400
I'll leave.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.600
Your Majesty, I only hope that you

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.840
won't develop any ill feelings
toward Mr. Bai because of this.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.120
Who do you think you are?

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.360
How dare you sow discord
between Li and me?

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.000
Enough!

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.720
He's just a poor man from the wasteland.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.520
Look at all his injuries.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.340
Why can't you tolerate
this pitiful person?

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.600
I love you

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.100
and my affection remains steadfast.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.020
But what about you, Your Majesty?

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.840
I...

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.320
Mung bean cake is cool-natured
and helps clear heat.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.180
Remember to eat it, Your Majesty.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.240
Bai.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.680
Are you hurt?

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.280
I'm okay.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.490
You accepted everyone else

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.600
except me, huh?

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:12.920
Mr. Bai,

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.340
Princess Royal requests your presence.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.280
What Sister loves most

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.480
is your eyes.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.400
I just haven't found

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.800
what complements them.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.600
Now,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.440
without Rao Jun's help

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.440
and blood nourishment,

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.960
I can't even maintain

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.440
your facade anymore.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.200
Your Highness, what do you want with me?

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:58.880
Come here.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.480
You promised me

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.720
that if I handed over
the incense formula,

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.450
you would give me the antidote.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.200
But

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.800
the formula you gave me

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.840
is fake.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.040
I...

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.400
I

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.120
followed exactly how Her Majesty

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.720
made the incense that day...

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.920
Guess

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.240
how many days will it take for the poison

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.240
to reach Feng Li's heart

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.320
and how many days

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.240
can she live?

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.100
Your Highness,

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.440
I can give you anything you want。

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.090
But I didn't deceive you

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.730
in the incense formula.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.600
That's not what I wanted to hear.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:03.920
I must

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.160
give you a little

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.960
punishment.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.320
I wonder if Mr. Bai's blood

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.760
is sweet enough

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.720
to satisfy him.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.880
Mr. Bai,

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.920
don't be stingy.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.560
Your blood is indeed sweet.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.640
He likes it very much.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.240
I am willing

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.410
to offer a cup of my blood every day.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.640
I only want Your Highness to provide medicine

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.360
to ensure Her Majesty's well-being.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.640
Since you begged me so earnestly,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.920
how could I not grant your wish?

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.440
Thank you, Your Highness.
