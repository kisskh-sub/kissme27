00:08:16.801 --> 00:08:17.880
Silk Stocking milk tea.

00:08:18.481 --> 00:08:19.601
One Silk Stocking for each.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.481
Thanks for the Silk Stocking.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.361
- Thank you, Xuemei.
- Thank you, Xuemei.

00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:24.536
Thanks for the Silk Stocking.

00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:25.840
Thanks, Xuemei.

00:08:26.161 --> 00:08:26.960
Booming business.

00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:32.680
We're here. Get off the bus.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:33.841
Welcome!

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.640
Welcome! Welcome!

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.640
You're too kind.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:36.920
- Welcome!
- Too kind.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.520
Welcome!

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.961
- I get people here.
- Welcome to Yuehai!

00:08:39.001 --> 00:08:39.841
Welcome!

00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:40.800
Welcome to Yuehai!

00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:42.441
Welcome! Welcome!

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.280
Everyone,

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.040
this is Super Dog Restaurant,
newly opened here in Yuehai.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.400
Cantonese dim sum
is available for you inside.

00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:50.520
You can take a rest and grab a bite.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.560
Eat right after getting off the bus?

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.560
You must eat.

00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:56.241
Well, Yuehai people are so enthusiastic

00:08:56.441 --> 00:08:57.640
and have arranged everything.

00:08:57.841 --> 00:08:58.841
No need for formalities.

00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:01.241
After eating, you'll have the energy
to explore Yuehai.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.640
Come on.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.680
- Come on.
- Please.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.841
- Alright.
- Watch the steps.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.640
Go ahead.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.640
Please come in.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.321
Try our food,
and you won't want to leave.

00:09:08.721 --> 00:09:09.361
Come on in.

00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:11.800
I managed to gather
a whole busload of people for you.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.880
Just now on the road,
everyone was wondering

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.160
if Yuehai would turn out
to be some rural backwater.

00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:17.880
You must make proper arrangements.

00:09:18.321 --> 00:09:19.160
Don't worry, Ms. Dan.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.121
Thank you.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.241
Have a seat.

00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:23.040
Feel at home. No need to be formal.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.441
This way, please.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.441
Bring some water.

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:30.760
Please help keep this meal reasonable.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.160
- Right.
- It mustn't exceed the budget.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:32.880
- Right.
- Okay?

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.136
Mr. Tan's here. It'll be fine.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.680
Two bottles of wine.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.961
Clarify each dish's unit price
and total cost.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.152
By the way...

00:09:40.601 --> 00:09:41.160
It's nice.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.160
Please come inside.

00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:43.640
Let's sit there.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.241
The food here is quite fashionable.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.081
Our place is close to the port.

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:49.680
It's the latest trend.

00:09:49.841 --> 00:09:51.520
Try our food,
and you won't want to leave.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.081
I'm not exaggerating.

00:09:53.361 --> 00:09:55.160
See this beer?
One bottle makes you crave two.

00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:56.001
Then you crave...

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.040
Try it.

00:09:57.481 --> 00:09:58.640
I can't drink. I'm driving.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.504
- You try it first.
- It'll get in the way.

00:10:00.504 --> 00:10:01.241
Okay.

00:10:01.241 --> 00:10:02.241
Come on, everyone.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.760
Make yourselves at home.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.121
Consider Yuehai your own home.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.680
First, try some homemade dishes.

00:10:08.081 --> 00:10:08.680
Just a second.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.248
(Super Dog Restaurant)

00:10:20.441 --> 00:10:22.201
Ms. Liu, why don't you propose a toast?

00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:22.880
Right. Come on.

00:10:23.201 --> 00:10:24.601
Let's all express our gratitude

00:10:24.721 --> 00:10:26.400
- to Yuehai's...
- I see why you took me here.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.160
So that's what you wanted, huh?

00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:30.280
We agreed on 100 yuan.
Now you're changing it?

00:10:30.321 --> 00:10:32.760
It's my place. I have the final say.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.920
Someone else offered more. What's wrong?

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.560
Wait. How could you do that to me?

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.800
Stop arguing. Stop it.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.841
Go argue outside.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.640
Act more civilized.

00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:41.040
- Talk calmly.
- Take it outside.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.841
We can go to the town government
to solve it.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.441
Don't go to the town government.
Let's solve it here.

00:10:45.816 --> 00:10:46.880
- Talk here.
- Our leaders are here.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.841
Go ahead. Let's see how serious it is.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.001
Leaders, here's the situation.

00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:53.361
He agreed to rent his place to me

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.721
for 100 yuan a month.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.081
I've moved all my belongings here.

00:10:57.441 --> 00:10:58.441
- But now he tells me...
- What 100 yuan?

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.400
- He's not renting.
- Nothing.

00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:01.040
You're going back on your word!

00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:02.920
The rent was supposed
to be 100 yuan a month.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.201
Then he raised it to 120.

00:11:04.441 --> 00:11:05.880
- He can't accept that.
- Just rent somewhere else.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.880
He can raise the price?

00:11:07.721 --> 00:11:09.016
- Who knows?
- Sir.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.601
- People keep coming here.
- You agreed on the rent.

00:11:11.601 --> 00:11:13.001
- They just do.
- A deal is a deal.

00:11:13.001 --> 00:11:14.121
- Please, carry on.
- Exactly.

00:11:14.201 --> 00:11:15.601
Why aren't you keeping your word?

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.520
We agreed on 100. Now you want 20 more?

00:11:17.721 --> 00:11:18.640
Please calm down.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.160
Stay calm.

00:11:19.241 --> 00:11:21.241
Did you sign any agreement earlier?

00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:22.160
Yes, we did.

00:11:23.841 --> 00:11:25.601
You're wrong since there's an agreement.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.640
Wait, the agreement...

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.520
Let us see it.

00:11:31.096 --> 00:11:31.704
Come on.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.800
- Look. Here.
- I'm leaving.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.856
Look, sir.

00:11:37.112 --> 00:11:38.328
Now it's entirely your fault.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.441
You've already signed and sealed it.
A deal is a deal, right?

00:11:41.441 --> 00:11:42.168
Ms. Liu,

00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:43.601
here in Yuehai,

00:11:43.601 --> 00:11:45.560
- a place
- This agreement has legal standing.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.961
costs 120 yuan a month.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.241
This is laughable.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.001
People will think we staged this.

00:11:50.321 --> 00:11:51.640
Lost your nerve? Sit down.

00:11:52.001 --> 00:11:53.400
Even you feel embarrassed now.

00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:54.121
Be honest.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.121
The rent he's charging
is actually quite low.

00:11:56.361 --> 00:11:57.640
120 yuan is the normal price.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.721
Some even charge 150.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.201
My brother-in-law told me
business on this street is booming.

00:12:02.601 --> 00:12:04.920
So rents keep going up and up.

00:12:05.841 --> 00:12:07.560
I don't own a shop on this street.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.880
If I did, I'd quit everything else.

00:12:10.201 --> 00:12:12.800
Just collecting rent
could get me a thousand yuan a year.

00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:16.721
So building in Yuehai
sounds like a great idea.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.321
Of course.

00:12:17.841 --> 00:12:18.721
Right?

00:12:18.721 --> 00:12:19.601
It's 150.

00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:22.321
It could even be 200, right?

00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:24.680
- Two hundred?
- Right? Yuehai is quite good, isn't it?

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.272
Yeah.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.121
I've finished a whole bottle.
What took you so long?

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.400
Well? How did it go?

00:12:39.841 --> 00:12:41.321
Did you sign it?

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.040
It fell through.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.880
Fell through? Then why are you so happy?

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.321
I'm not happy
because the deal fell through.

00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:51.481
I'm happy because I found a solution.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.160
Stop beating around the bush.

00:12:54.601 --> 00:12:55.841
What solution?

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.760
Do you know why we lost the order?

00:12:58.841 --> 00:12:59.361
Why?

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.400
Because their boss found a factory
in Nanzhou.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:03.760
You know why?

00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:05.001
Why?

00:13:05.001 --> 00:13:06.321
Because that factory

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.280
handles everything
from raw materials and design

00:13:09.441 --> 00:13:10.880
to printing services. It's one-stop.

00:13:11.441 --> 00:13:12.160
Very convenient.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.481
If it were you, which would you pick?

00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:16.961
So what?

00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:19.880
So I think about this one-stop service.

00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:22.920
If they can do it in Nanzhou,
why can't we do it here in Yuehai?

00:13:24.201 --> 00:13:25.121
Think about it, Xuemei.

00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:27.441
I know so many bosses in printing.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.361
If we bring all our factories together,

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.800
we integrate the whole chain.

00:13:31.081 --> 00:13:33.481
With the huge demand
for printing nationwide

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.361
and our quality being this top-notch,

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.800
we'd never worry about orders again.

00:13:41.841 --> 00:13:43.280
That's not a bad idea.

00:13:44.481 --> 00:13:45.040
Also,

00:13:47.032 --> 00:13:48.152
I think

00:13:48.152 --> 00:13:50.321
we could create an entire new street

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.144
to relocate
all the printing businesses in Yuehai

00:13:53.368 --> 00:13:54.880
or even nearby here.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.280
We can create a printing street.

00:13:58.121 --> 00:13:59.241
That's a brilliant idea.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.040
Well, Xuemei,

00:14:01.121 --> 00:14:02.321
I knew I saw potential in you.

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:04.841
You've got vision, just like me.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.121
I certainly have vision.

00:14:06.321 --> 00:14:07.481
You sort of have some too.

00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:09.121
But what about them?

00:14:09.601 --> 00:14:11.321
That requires a huge investment.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.680
Don't worry. If you take the lead,

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.680
they'll definitely be on board.

00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:28.680
No. I'm definitely not willing.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.961
Guo Fugui, could you aim
a bit longer-term?

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.400
Aim it at you?

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.160
I said long-term, not me.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.601
Xuemei, I know you're highly respected.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:42.920
Don't say that.

00:14:43.001 --> 00:14:44.481
But I don't get this plan.

00:14:45.361 --> 00:14:47.961
Why bundle our shops together?

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.241
To charge more?

00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:50.800
Exactly.

00:14:51.361 --> 00:14:53.560
Xuemei, you don't have
some hidden agenda, do you?

00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:54.520
Go away.

00:14:55.121 --> 00:14:56.024
Go away.

00:14:57.241 --> 00:14:59.601
I understand all your concerns.

00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:01.760
I've said my piece.

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:03.760
Here's another example.

00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:07.201
Take those snack stalls on Fuyu Road.

00:15:08.321 --> 00:15:09.680
Business is booming, right?

00:15:10.721 --> 00:15:11.280
Isn't it?

00:15:12.001 --> 00:15:13.601
Not only is business better,

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.841
but vegetable farmers and meat vendors

00:15:16.001 --> 00:15:18.361
all gather nearby to supply them.

00:15:18.601 --> 00:15:20.040
So prices come down.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.400
You're all in business.

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:23.640
Think about it. Doesn't it make sense?

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.880
That's right.

00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:27.880
What's that called? It's called...

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.121
Forming cliques?

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.880
The cluster effect.

00:15:34.721 --> 00:15:36.081
The cluster effect.

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:36.961
What's that?

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:37.601
Everyone,

00:15:38.321 --> 00:15:40.841
if we bring our printing businesses

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.640
all together to form a cluster,

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.880
it'll naturally build a brand

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.640
and attract many more customers.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.241
Besides, we can save on shipping costs.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.241
You know nothing, you bumpkin.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.961
What was the effect again?

00:15:55.841 --> 00:15:56.601
Clutter.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.001
The cluster effect.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.160
Right, clutter.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.760
Well, I can consider it.

00:16:02.201 --> 00:16:04.160
But relocating the factory
isn't a small sum.

00:16:04.721 --> 00:16:05.800
I'm a bit short on money.

00:16:06.121 --> 00:16:08.481
As long as it doesn't cost much,
I'm fine.

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:09.760
Wait, Xuemei,

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.721
I have a small issue here. Well...

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.800
Xuemei, I might not have enough money.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.128
I know how much money you have.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.121
Right.

00:16:20.121 --> 00:16:21.001
- Everyone.
- Not enough money.

00:16:21.081 --> 00:16:23.081
Listen, don't worry about the money.

00:16:23.321 --> 00:16:25.081
I know many big bosses.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.961
We can just ask them to invest.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.001
Moreover, I heard

00:16:29.081 --> 00:16:31.081
Ms. Chang, a businesswoman
in Hong Kong, China,

00:16:31.081 --> 00:16:32.920
has been investing around here recently.

00:16:33.081 --> 00:16:35.081
She's currently in Nanzhou.

00:16:35.481 --> 00:16:36.800
Let's just go find her.

00:16:36.961 --> 00:16:38.841
But she's one
of Chinese Hong Kong investors.

00:16:41.441 --> 00:16:42.640
Are they reliable?

00:16:42.721 --> 00:16:44.121
They are, but he isn't.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.880
The wind has ruined my new hairstyle.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.481
We all got a new hairstyle.

00:16:57.961 --> 00:16:58.760
What's keeping him?

00:16:59.001 --> 00:16:59.736
Mr. Zheng.

00:17:00.408 --> 00:17:01.176
- Mr. Zheng.
- Mr. Zheng.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.001
Waiting ruined our hairstyles.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.560
Finally back.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.320
Why are you here?

00:17:06.481 --> 00:17:08.080
You've worked hard.
Come on, let me help you.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:08.760
No. It's dirty.

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:11.080
We went to the town government
looking for you.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.280
They said you came here
to inspect the fisheries.

00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:14.161
So we came for you.

00:17:14.161 --> 00:17:14.721
Right.

00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:15.360
Exactly.

00:17:15.961 --> 00:17:19.080
We must develop both new
and traditional industries, right?

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.040
- Exactly.
- Yes.

00:17:20.241 --> 00:17:21.201
What did you come for?

00:17:21.201 --> 00:17:21.760
Something.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.424
Something big.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.360
A printing street?

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.464
Right.

00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:27.600
That's a great idea.

00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:30.401
If we can gather together

00:17:30.641 --> 00:17:32.080
all Yuehai's printing plants,

00:17:32.481 --> 00:17:33.161
it'll be great.

00:17:33.241 --> 00:17:34.080
- Right.
- Right.

00:17:34.241 --> 00:17:35.681
But this sounds expensive.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:36.681
- Right.
- Right.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:37.520
Can you handle it?

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.401
We definitely can't.

00:17:40.401 --> 00:17:41.241
Right.

00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:42.072
But Mr. Zheng,

00:17:42.072 --> 00:17:44.881
a Chinese Hong Kong investor has
been operating on Chinese mainland.

00:17:45.001 --> 00:17:46.201
She's very wealthy.

00:17:46.241 --> 00:17:46.840
Right.

00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:49.080
If we can get her to invest in us,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.040
we can surely do it.

00:17:50.201 --> 00:17:50.881
Yes.

00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:51.641
That sounds great.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.080
Then, get moving.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.360
- No.
- No.

00:17:54.401 --> 00:17:56.280
If it's just us two, we'll fail.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.080
Right.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.560
We don't carry enough weight.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.224
Right.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.520
Mr. Zheng,
if you could represent Yuehai,

00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:04.001
it would work.

00:18:04.161 --> 00:18:04.721
Absolutely.

00:18:06.241 --> 00:18:07.441
So I need to step in?

00:18:07.481 --> 00:18:08.040
Yes.

00:18:13.241 --> 00:18:14.961
Alright then. This is important.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.080
Right.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:16.600
Right.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.001
You two set a time.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.600
I'll go with you, okay?

00:18:20.152 --> 00:18:20.760
Mr. Zheng,

00:18:21.592 --> 00:18:23.600
no better day than today.

00:18:23.641 --> 00:18:24.320
Right.

00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:27.401
My friend says this investor
is negotiating deals in Nanzhou now.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.161
I'm afraid if we go too late,

00:18:29.201 --> 00:18:31.080
she'll invest the money elsewhere.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.080
It will be disastrous.

00:18:32.161 --> 00:18:33.120
It will be a pity.

00:18:35.641 --> 00:18:36.600
I see what's happening.

00:18:37.401 --> 00:18:39.681
You are playing off each other,
putting on a show for me

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.080
and trying to reel me in, huh?

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.441
No, not at all.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.401
We wouldn't dare.

00:18:48.481 --> 00:18:49.280
Let me get ready.

00:18:49.881 --> 00:18:51.201
And we can go now.

00:18:52.001 --> 00:18:52.600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:54.401
Mr. Zheng. Mr. Zheng.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.560
Before we go,

00:18:56.241 --> 00:18:59.120
I need to properly tell you
about this investor.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.201
Ms. Chang is really beautiful.

00:19:06.441 --> 00:19:07.600
Like a celebrity.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.360
What do you mean by that?

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.161
She is a genuine celebrity, okay?

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.241
I remember now.

00:19:14.881 --> 00:19:15.840
She is the one.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.721
She is Chang Jiaren.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.481
Right.

00:19:18.481 --> 00:19:20.040
She is a Belle of Hong Kong, China.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:20.681
Right.

00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:21.600
But she didn't win.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.320
Right.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.040
Seems she was an actress
for a few years.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.600
Then where did she go later?

00:19:25.721 --> 00:19:27.120
She retired from acting later

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.481
and started doing business.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.161
She became incredibly successful.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.201
No wonder she looked so familiar.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.360
Seems like a tough nut to crack.

00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:37.600
Yeah, but I believe

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.201
you can definitely crack this tough nut.

00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:42.441
Yeah, crack her.

00:19:42.641 --> 00:19:43.416
Crack her.

00:19:56.481 --> 00:19:57.208
Hello, Ms. Chang.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:58.961
Who are you?

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.360
Ms. Chang, I'm the secretary of Yuehai.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.760
Yes, we're all from Yuehai.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:04.840
Yuehai?

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.840
Sorry, I never heard of it.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:07.681
I'm in a hurry.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.120
Make way, please.

00:20:09.201 --> 00:20:09.760
Act now.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.552
Got it.

00:20:13.001 --> 00:20:13.800
Here it is.

00:20:14.001 --> 00:20:15.241
What do you want exactly?

00:20:15.401 --> 00:20:16.080
(Yuehai Town Master Plan)
Look.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.401
Ms. Chang,
since you aren't familiar with Yuehai,

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.600
let me introduce it.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.080
Yuehai is a town under Pingchuan County
in Dongjiang Province.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.840
A town built by farmers.

00:20:25.201 --> 00:20:27.921
Our town has many successful
businesspeople, 10,000-yuan households.

00:20:28.401 --> 00:20:30.401
Especially in printing.
There are dozens of them.

00:20:32.001 --> 00:20:32.840
(Yuehai Town Master Plan)
That's right.

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.120
Stuff. The stuff.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.360
Right, right.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.040
Here. Here.

00:20:38.872 --> 00:20:40.080
Well, Ms. Chang,

00:20:40.241 --> 00:20:42.360
(Sample Catalog)
here are the samples from my factory.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.280
Take a look.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:44.641
(Hongyu Foods, Jianghui Water Factory)
Look.

00:20:44.881 --> 00:20:47.681
Ms. Chang, I-I'm in sales.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.961
These are all the deals I've closed.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.040
The con... contracts.

00:20:53.241 --> 00:20:53.881
The contracts.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.481
You just said

00:20:59.001 --> 00:21:01.241
you are the secretary of Yuehai?

00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:02.641
Yuehai.

00:21:03.001 --> 00:21:05.600
Yes, the Secretary of Yuehai,
the genuine article.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:06.921
That's right.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.264
(Printing Order Contract)

00:21:11.441 --> 00:21:12.760
My introduction letter.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.401
My work ID.

00:21:14.921 --> 00:21:15.840
And my official seal.

00:21:19.201 --> 00:21:21.721
Do you Yuehai people
always bring so much stuff

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.512

Ms. Chang doesn't visit us often.

00:29:09.641 --> 00:29:12.280
Make sure the security
is impeccable, okay?

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.320
Keep it up.

00:29:13.721 --> 00:29:14.520
Step back.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.120
Step back.

00:29:15.241 --> 00:29:16.344
Stop looking.

00:29:16.344 --> 00:29:17.520
Move! Stop looking.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.161
Well, Ms. Chang.

00:29:26.481 --> 00:29:28.800
We're here today as the leading team

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.360
to meet you.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.560
Yes, leading team. We...

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.360
We're from the Yuehai People's Commerce

00:29:36.481 --> 00:29:38.600
Development Research Association.
He's Vice Chairman.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.161
I'm the Chairwoman.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.481
We've made some resolutions
during our research meetings.

00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:49.201
Today we'll brief you now.

00:29:49.241 --> 00:29:49.760
Indeed.

00:29:51.921 --> 00:29:54.201
Well, the...

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.320
The printing street.

00:29:57.401 --> 00:29:58.080
Exactly.

00:29:58.721 --> 00:30:00.161
To establish this district,

00:30:00.241 --> 00:30:02.001
firstly, transportation access
is crucial.

00:30:02.481 --> 00:30:03.201
Near the dock,

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.560
so long and wide.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.360
So long and wide.

00:30:05.401 --> 00:30:06.921
It needs an existing road.

00:30:07.481 --> 00:30:09.080
Therefore,

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.120
here in Yuehai,

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.096
the only suitable road we have...

00:30:15.576 --> 00:30:16.360
Only this one.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:16.961
It is this one.

00:30:18.001 --> 00:30:19.961
So, Ms. Chang, as you can see,

00:30:20.481 --> 00:30:21.760
it's a four-lane road.

00:30:21.921 --> 00:30:22.520
Yes.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.040
Here.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:23.721
The dock.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.441
Here.

00:30:24.441 --> 00:30:25.016
The port.

00:30:25.161 --> 00:30:25.800
Here.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.001
A road.

00:30:27.201 --> 00:30:28.161
To the warehouse.

00:30:28.201 --> 00:30:28.824
Yes.

00:30:29.001 --> 00:30:29.520
Excellent.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.360
Vice Chairman, this was
just completed last month, right?

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.161
Yes, Chairwoman.

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.120
Excellent.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.120
So this is the existing road we can use.

00:30:38.401 --> 00:30:40.241
We've essentially gained a head start.

00:30:40.241 --> 00:30:40.881
Yes.

00:30:40.881 --> 00:30:42.840
- Time is money.
- Money.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.961
Regarding the principle
that time is money,

00:30:44.961 --> 00:30:45.800
here's my view...

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:46.641
Quiet!

00:30:47.641 --> 00:30:48.280
Quite good.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.320
Ms. Chang, don't look at the sides.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.520
Just look at this main road.

00:30:51.681 --> 00:30:53.441
It's flat and wide, quite barren.

00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:54.360
Quiet!

00:30:54.641 --> 00:30:55.401
It's quite barren.

00:30:55.641 --> 00:30:57.280
- We'll clear the grass on both sides.
- Ms. Gao!

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.040
Ms. Gao!

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.280
She told you

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.360
to be quiet.

00:31:02.641 --> 00:31:04.080
She's telling you to shut up.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.161
Why not tell me earlier?

00:31:05.641 --> 00:31:07.120
She is already angry!

00:31:07.961 --> 00:31:08.481
Quiet!

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.080
This barren land
doesn't show us anything useful.

00:31:12.201 --> 00:31:13.161
But the road is decent.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.681
We've looked at several already.

00:31:15.161 --> 00:31:16.721
Why do they all seem about the same?

00:31:18.241 --> 00:31:20.721
Maybe we should go back
and check the previous one?

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.120
The one we saw earlier.

00:31:22.201 --> 00:31:23.721
Stop looking, we're done.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.520
You said they're all about the same.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.401
Just pick this.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.120
Ms. Liu.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.641
I think this road is excellent, really.

00:31:31.721 --> 00:31:32.441
How?

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.641
The road itself

00:31:34.681 --> 00:31:36.800
is clearly well-constructed, right?

00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:38.001
And...

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.120
Here, help me hold this.

00:31:39.641 --> 00:31:40.760
Look at the planning map.

00:31:40.881 --> 00:31:42.001
We're currently right here.

00:31:42.201 --> 00:31:43.681
This road is called Binhai Road.

00:31:43.721 --> 00:31:44.961
Binhai 1st Road.

00:31:45.001 --> 00:31:45.520
Here it is.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.681
This one.

00:31:46.681 --> 00:31:48.001
What's here? The port.

00:31:48.961 --> 00:31:50.721
See how close we are to the port.

00:31:51.001 --> 00:31:53.001
And all these surrounding
commercial blocks

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.681
are all interconnected right here.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.824
With excellent access and a hospital.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.800
For building a house,

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.241
is there any better location
in Yuehai than here?

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.921
- Exactly!
- Yes, it's perfect.

00:32:03.161 --> 00:32:04.401
Look at the hospital.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.001
How well-planned.

00:32:06.961 --> 00:32:07.600
Mr. Ma.

00:32:08.481 --> 00:32:10.040
Got any inside information?

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:10.721
No.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.120
Share it with us.

00:32:12.408 --> 00:32:12.961
I don't...

00:32:12.961 --> 00:32:14.201
Come on, share it.

00:32:14.401 --> 00:32:15.441
No, really.

00:32:15.481 --> 00:32:17.120
I'm just analyzing the map.

00:32:17.241 --> 00:32:19.441
Did your brother-in-law
tell you something?

00:32:20.241 --> 00:32:21.001
He told me nothing.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.360
Really, it's my own analysis.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.681
He clearly has inside information.

00:32:25.681 --> 00:32:26.241
Right?

00:32:26.241 --> 00:32:27.560
No, I...

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.201
I'm just analyzing it from the map.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.961
Well, Mr. Wang,

00:32:32.481 --> 00:32:34.360
what do you think?

00:32:35.881 --> 00:32:36.800
I'll follow your lead.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.520
Don't say so.

00:32:39.032 --> 00:32:39.864
It's a major matter,

00:32:40.472 --> 00:32:42.280
we should decide it together, right?

00:32:42.401 --> 00:32:43.681
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.881
This spot is good, right?

00:32:45.001 --> 00:32:46.681
Well, I have a suggestion.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.441
How about

00:32:49.161 --> 00:32:50.681
we trust Mr. Ma for once?

00:32:50.721 --> 00:32:51.441
Don't.

00:32:51.721 --> 00:32:54.280
Trusting him is trusting
Secretary Zheng Decheng, right?

00:32:54.401 --> 00:32:55.280
- Right.
- Right.

00:32:55.481 --> 00:32:56.360
- Trust. Yes.
- Right.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.401
Trusting my brother-in-law
is definitely safe.

00:32:58.441 --> 00:32:59.641
But you decide it yourself.

00:32:59.641 --> 00:33:01.280
I'll follow you. This location is great.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.441
- I'll follow you.
- You know?

00:33:02.641 --> 00:33:03.481
- Make way!
- Sure.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.080
- Make way!
- Trust him.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.921
- The port we saw is...
- Go over there.

00:33:05.921 --> 00:33:06.641
- That way is...
- Make way!

00:33:06.681 --> 00:33:07.241
Over there.

00:33:07.401 --> 00:33:08.120
Step back.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.120
- Stop looking.
- Make way!

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.881
The wind is strong,
so her hat might blow away.

00:33:51.241 --> 00:33:52.201
She holds it tight.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.441
Why are they doing like this?

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.040
You should do it too.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.040
I am doing it now.

00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:06.241
Ms. Chang.

00:34:06.241 --> 00:34:07.280
Can we stop being quiet?

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.321
Quite anxious now.

00:34:08.761 --> 00:34:09.640
- Ms. Chang.
- Ms. Chang.

00:34:09.761 --> 00:34:10.680
Why turned around?

00:34:13.361 --> 00:34:13.921
This is it.

00:34:15.321 --> 00:34:16.001
Right here.

00:34:24.321 --> 00:34:25.401
Ms. Dan, thank you.

00:34:25.881 --> 00:34:26.841
(Purchaser: Liu Dan)
So thoughtful.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.520
Signing this letter of intent,

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.761
I must take responsibility
for these thousands of cadres.

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.481
We owe them a proper explanation.

00:34:35.481 --> 00:34:36.240
Here, Secretary.

00:34:39.401 --> 00:34:42.560
If you approve, please sign right here.

00:34:42.841 --> 00:34:44.441
I've stated everything clearly on it.

00:34:44.881 --> 00:34:47.401
The cadres
have collectively chosen Binhai Road.

00:34:47.801 --> 00:34:49.720
To live together and support each other.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:50.881
No problem.

00:34:52.281 --> 00:34:53.120
Then I'll sign now.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.481
Once I sign, this becomes binding.

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:56.321
Okay.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.600
It becomes binding.

00:34:59.288 --> 00:35:00.792
(Zheng Decheng)

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.392
Okay.

00:35:03.401 --> 00:35:04.761
Well, Ms. Liu.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.281
Binhai Road is now yours.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:09.761
Thank you

00:35:10.481 --> 00:35:11.240
and cadres.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.720
You've provided tremendous support
to Yuehai.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.160
Thank you all.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.361
Don't say that. I'm just doing it for...

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.281
for the sake of Yuehai.

00:35:23.841 --> 00:35:25.720
Alright, I'll head back now.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.200
I'll have the cadres prepare the funds

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.801
and finish the paperwork.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:30.640
No problem.

00:35:33.361 --> 00:35:34.001
Here.

00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:34.881
Cheers!

00:35:35.001 --> 00:35:35.921
Xuemei, Xuemei.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:36.841
Xue... Don't.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:37.640
Don't go.

00:35:37.761 --> 00:35:38.720
We're still celebrating.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.841
No. I've drunk too much.

00:35:39.841 --> 00:35:40.536
I'm done.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.600
If you must leave,
let me review the contract again.

00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:45.640
Okay.

00:35:45.961 --> 00:35:46.841
Review it once more.

00:35:46.881 --> 00:35:48.080
- Want to review it?
- Right.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.520
Don't be anxious.

00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:51.680
Here, review it.

00:35:55.961 --> 00:35:58.240
Ms. Chang is really resolute.

00:35:58.321 --> 00:35:59.961
Of course. I handled it.

00:36:01.361 --> 00:36:03.321
Oh my, your mouth
is so greasy from eating.

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.040
Don't ruin it.

00:36:05.361 --> 00:36:06.961
Come, give it kisses too.

00:36:07.001 --> 00:36:07.704
Here.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.200
Wait for me.

00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:09.961
Leaving?

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:10.961
I'm leaving first.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.640
No more drinks.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.801
Right, find Secretary
first thing tomorrow

00:36:15.001 --> 00:36:17.720
and tell him we've reserved Binhai Road.

00:36:17.881 --> 00:36:18.441
Don't worry.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.361
This matters.

00:36:19.401 --> 00:36:20.200
Don't drink too much

00:36:20.361 --> 00:36:21.600
- and delay things.
- I know.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.921
Alright, I'm leaving now.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:23.761
Be safe.

00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:24.761
Okay, I'm off.

00:36:27.441 --> 00:36:29.921
Everyone, wishing you wealth.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.720
Wishing you wealth.

00:36:33.961 --> 00:36:35.040
Not sure who said it.

Everyone, calm down.

00:36:59.361 --> 00:37:00.961
We'll reach Yuehai shortly.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.560
After the payment and paperwork,

00:37:02.801 --> 00:37:04.560
Binhai Road will belong to us.

00:37:05.481 --> 00:37:08.240
My role here concludes temporarily.

00:37:08.801 --> 00:37:10.600
I'd also like to thank you all

00:37:10.841 --> 00:37:13.600
for supporting and cooperating with me.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.160
But the next steps,

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.881
like building houses or renting,

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.321
it's not my business then.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.361
For example,

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.961
I introduced you to a partner

00:37:23.321 --> 00:37:24.640
and you got married.

00:37:24.921 --> 00:37:25.841
After the wedding,

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.680
having and raising children

00:37:27.761 --> 00:37:29.801
is not my business then, right?

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.001
Let's thank Ms. Liu.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.801
- Thank you, Ms. Liu.
- Thank you.

00:37:36.401 --> 00:37:38.881
Ms. Liu, you're the best.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.640
You led us to this excellent opportunity

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.640
and enabled us cadres
to live together, right?

00:37:44.841 --> 00:37:45.841
- Yes.
- Exactly.

00:37:45.961 --> 00:37:49.040
Rest assured.
We'll handle everything from here

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.680
and complete the mission.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.200
Ms. Liu helped us a lot.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.281
After the paperwork, let's treat Ms. Liu
to dinner, okay?

00:37:56.441 --> 00:37:57.560
Absolutely.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.441
We must treat you.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.200
No need.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:00.080
Truly.

00:38:00.441 --> 00:38:03.401
You're still a long way
from building or renting houses.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.520
We'll have time
after finishing everything.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.441
We must get the paperwork done today.

00:38:08.801 --> 00:38:09.881
One last check.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.761
Your household registration and work ID.

00:38:12.881 --> 00:38:13.801
Check if you have them.

00:38:14.321 --> 00:38:15.560
- We have them.
- Got them.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.281
We've got them.

00:38:16.281 --> 00:38:17.001
All set.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.040
They're all in the bag.

Big trouble.

What's wrong?

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.120

Big trouble!

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.720
Coming. What happened?

00:38:51.761 --> 00:38:53.160
Binhai Road's gone!

00:38:53.441 --> 00:38:54.040
What?

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.160
Come on!

Come on! Let's go.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.160
What's wrong?

00:38:59.281 --> 00:39:00.080
Binhai Road's gone!

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:00.728
Gone?

Binhai Road...

00:39:10.961 --> 00:39:11.481
What?

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.801
Binhai Road's gone.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:14.720

Come on, put the table over here.

Line them up neatly.

at this table, okay?

00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:23.841
- Okay.
- Over here.

- Okay.

Yes, that's right.

00:39:31.361 --> 00:39:33.120
That table for the cash, okay?

00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:34.584
I'll handle it.

This is way too dramatic.

Not really.

Okay, thanks.

Why are you here?

Let's talk privately.

T-Talk privately.

Right, Secretary.

Are you giving Binhai Road
to the county cadres?

Yes, they'll come
handle the paperwork soon.

Ms. Chang also wants Binhai Road.

Yes, we've already signed the contract.

00:40:31.801 --> 00:40:33.720
Binhai Road is specified
in the contract.

00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:36.481
Ms. Chang insisted the printing street
must be on Binhai Road.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.200
Why didn't you tell me
since the contract's signed?

00:40:39.921 --> 00:40:42.080
We were coming to tell you this today.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.520
We didn't expect this.

It just collided.

Alright. I understand.

What's going on?

00:41:15.761 --> 00:41:17.720
Ms. Li, take a look at this.

00:41:22.001 --> 00:41:22.560
What is this?

00:41:29.656 --> 00:41:30.761
(Party A (Investor): Name: Chang Jiaren)

00:41:30.761 --> 00:41:31.961

00:41:33.481 --> 00:41:34.961
They want Binhai Road?

00:41:35.761 --> 00:41:36.472
Right.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.001
Listen to me.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.801
Xuemei and Changyuan want to

00:41:42.321 --> 00:41:43.600
build a printing street

00:41:44.321 --> 00:41:46.001
and found a Chinese Hong Kong investor.

00:41:46.921 --> 00:41:49.040
Well, it's hard for me

00:41:49.361 --> 00:41:50.200
to explain

00:41:51.001 --> 00:41:52.801
this matter clearly right now.

Well,

00:41:55.321 --> 00:41:58.488
I believe
this is a fantastic opportunity.

00:41:58.712 --> 00:42:00.841
It's an even better opportunity

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.560
than that Moca thing.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.001
What do you mean?

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.921
About the ownership of Binhai Road.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.520
Let's discuss this.

00:42:10.881 --> 00:42:12.240
What's there to discuss? Now?

00:42:12.401 --> 00:42:13.160
Isn't it too late?

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.680
The cadres are all coming now.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.680
They will arrive soon.

00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:19.560
I'll go meet them.

Ms. Li!

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.281
Let me finish. Listen.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.160
Look, about this...

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.761
About that seven-up, eight-down thing,

00:42:27.281 --> 00:42:29.160
I didn't understand you either, right?

00:42:29.481 --> 00:42:32.200
But later, I realized you truly did it
for Yuehai's development,

00:42:32.761 --> 00:42:33.761
so I understood you.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.921
But now, concerning
the Binhai Road ownership issue,

00:42:37.841 --> 00:42:39.921
I believe, and I hope,

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.720
you can definitely understand me, right?

00:42:43.881 --> 00:42:44.761

Look!

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.160
