00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.610
It's time you told Jang Mi the truth, Dad.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.540
Tell her that her mom is Suk Hee,
but Dad isn't her biological father.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.280
Tell her that she's not blood-related
to us at all!

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.780
I said stop.
If you say that one more time,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.150
I'm done with you.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.560
I don't care if you're done with me.
Just please, tell Jang Mi.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.930
- You need to stop this too, Dad!
- Just stop it, Oh Tae Sook.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.430
Let's talk about this later.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.840
Jang Mi.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.910
Tae Sook.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.510
What are you talking about?

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.820
That I'm not Dad's daughter?

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.450
Dad?

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.790
Am I really not your daughter?

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.730
No, that's not true, Jang Mi.
You are my daughter.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.760
She doesn't know what she's saying.
You're my daughter, no matter what.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.530
- Jang Mi, you're not his real daughter.
- Tae Sook, that's enough!

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.100
You're not related to us by blood at all.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.110
So I'm not related to you
and Tae Pyung at all?

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.010
No way...

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.710
- How can that be?
- It's simple.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.150
Jung Suk Hee is your birth mother,
and your father is someone else.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.590
I said, stop it!

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.760
Dad!

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.500
If you're going
to keep spouting this nonsense,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.860
don't you dare call me your father!
You hear me?

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.240
Jang Mi.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.610
Don't listen to her nonsense.
You are my daughter.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.880
Whatever they say, you're my daughter!
My own flesh and blood!

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.460
So there's no need to listen
to the awful things your sister is saying.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920
Okay?

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.160
Jang Mi!

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.310
Jun Ho, congratulations.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.880
For beating my mom and getting to stay
to entertain me.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.350
Can't you see I'm having a conversation
with Team Leader Jin?

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.260
- It's rude to just butt in like that.
- Jun Ho.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.290
She said you're here to entertain her.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.360
What's with you two?

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.100
Are you putting on this cutesy little act
just for me?

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.600
Of course not.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.700
I was just congratulating Jun Ho
for getting to stay.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.510
So you can join us in congratulating him,
Director Ma.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.180
Team Leader Jin, let's go.
We have a reservation in an hour.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.020
You have an hour, so what's the rush?
I just got here.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.920
We should eat the cake I brought
and hang out.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.990
You can enjoy it by yourself, Director Ma.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.570
Whatever. I don't care.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.640
Go ahead and pretend I'm invisible.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.370
Why would Jun Ho...

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.970
just make Director Ma feel so awkward
when she came to congratulate him?

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.680
What was the rush to leave like that?

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.910
You're so dense.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.320
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.590
Yes. And since you're so dense,
I'll give you a tip.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.030
Your mother can try
seducing my grandfather all she wants.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.830
But if I don't approve,
my grandfather will never remarry.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.030
So what's this tip you wanted to give me?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.040
- You are unbelievably dense.
- So what's your point?

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.110
You idiot!

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.540
I'm telling you to figure out
how to set me up with Jun Ho.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.740
Set you up with him?

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.480
- Why should I?
- Like inviting Jun Ho over to the house,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.380
or finding ways for me
to spend time with him.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.220
If I marry Jun Ho and move out,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.630
then back at home, your mother
and my grandfather...

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.230
will have a much better shot,
don't you think?

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.300
Do I have to spell everything out for you?
You're not as smart as you think.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.110
So you're saying Ma Seo Rin,
the real power in this family,

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.780
gave you the marching orders?

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.580
That's what she said.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.650
If she marries Jun Ho and moves out,

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.880
the Chairman won't need to tiptoe
around Seo Rin.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.320
Then he can marry you
and you can share his room.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.290
And then I'll be the wife
of the Chairman of Dream Group.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.760
And I'll be the Chairman's daughter.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.670
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.230
Even before we brought Mom home
from the hospital,

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.940
you were already living with us.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.040
Dad took good care of you.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.840
You know how much
Mom's medical bills are, right?

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.240
You're telling me...

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.380
I came here before Mom?

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.680
That's right.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.950
As a newborn, you wouldn't stop crying.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.920
I was up all night making you formula.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.660
I said that's enough!

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.360
Tae Sook, if you're not going
to listen to me, get out now!

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.200
Go on, why don't you slap this cheek too?

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.840
Are you that terrified of Jang Mi
finding out the truth?

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.270
Jang Mi.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.470
You don't have to listen
to what she's saying. All right?

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.250
No. I don't think I can trust you.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.650
Why did you keep this from me for so long?
It must have been so hard on you.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.250
If she hadn't told me the truth,

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.660
I would've just kept living like a fool...

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.490
Jang Mi.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.790
I had no idea.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.430
All this time, I thought that
before Mom got hurt,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.770
you two had promised to get married,
and then I was born.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.700
To think that I'm not related...

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.370
to Dad, Tae Sook, and Tae Pyung.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.750
Jang Mi. Nothing's changed between us,
okay? So...

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.150
No! The point is, I had no idea!

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.890
You were taking care of my mom and me,

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.050
and I never even realized
how hard it was for you.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.820
I'm so sorry, Dad.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.760
Jang Mi.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.500
Jang Mi!

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.500
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.900
Jang Mi.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.930
(From: Jung Suk Hee, Muho Villa,
Muho-ri, Taehan-gun, Chungnam)

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.190
I guess Tae Pyung reminds Mom of you
when you were young.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.560
Tae Pyung is my spitting image.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.800
I guess that's why I'm so pretty
since I take after you too.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.900
What?

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.640
But that'll be tough. Will you be okay?

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.780
Of course. I've got your stamina, don't I?

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.300
You ran away from home
just to end up here?

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.950
You still don't know how to drink?
What have you been doing?

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.760
It's because of my mom.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.730
- Mom!
- Suk Hee.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.330
- Mom!
- My Jang Mi's here. It's my Jang Mi.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.600
Mom!

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.210
Look, Jang Mi's here. It's Jang Mi.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.440
Jang Mi!

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.480
Jang Mi's here.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.910
I was so scared. I thought you were gone.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.220
It's okay, all right? It's okay.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.350
If I was out of her sight
for even a moment,

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.490
my mom got restless
and started looking for me,

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.030
and she wandered off and got lost before.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.300
That's why,

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.930
back when I was in school,

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.470
I never even got to
go on the school trips.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.230
Not even school trips?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.240
Yes.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.340
So how could I...

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.010
have just gone out drinking for fun...

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.580
when my mom was always looking for me?

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.350
Couldn't it be the other way around?

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.020
- The other way around?
- Why do you think she only looks for you?

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.460
Isn't it possible
she's trying to protect you?

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.060
But you know...

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.130
what my mother's condition is like.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.040
How could a mother in her state...

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.740
Even in her condition,
her muscle memory is still there.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.470
Like cooking or sewing.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.550
A mother's heart
that wants to protect you,

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.750
the child she carried for ten months
and gave birth to.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.850
That maternal instinct is still there.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.530
I don't know.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.530
Everything is a jumbled mess right now.
I'm so confused.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.200
This isn't the world I thought I knew.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.170
It feels like I'm living
in a completely different world.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.540
And that goes for the mom
I thought I knew.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.350
My dad, too.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.320
It's like they're both complete strangers.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.490
That my dad and I...

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.060
don't share a single drop of blood.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.630
I never would've imagined it
in my wildest dreams.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.720
I just knew my son would pull it off!

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.650
Honey, did you hear that?

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.820
Our Jun Ho put that insufferable hotel CEO
in her place.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.800
- I'm just glad you got through it, son.
- Congratulations, Jun Ho.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.330
So you get to stay on as head chef
at Dream Hotel's Chang Restaurant, right?

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.900
Did you think I would fail?

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.300
The place was just such a mess,
so I was itching to rebuild it...

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.340
from scratch.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.970
Of course. I'd expect nothing less
from my son.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.080
But is the hotel CEO
really that insufferable?

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.520
- She didn't seem that way to me.
- What would you know about her?

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.150
That's right. You did some work
for that hotel, didn't you?

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:02.450
I did.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.820
She might be tough on Jun Ho,
but she does a lot of good things.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.260
- She sponsors people in need.
- Right?

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.260
That's the impression I got.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:15.000
Here, try this.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.740
Chairman, what would you think about
inviting Chef Kang Jun Ho to the house?

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.270
- Invite who over?
- Chef Kang Jun Ho.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.440
He just more than doubled the sales
within two months.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:28.480
I worked so hard to recruit him,

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.480
so I think we should formally host him
to show our appreciation.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:33.650
What?

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.120
So she took the hint.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.060
If you want to thank him,
do it on your own time.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.590
Inviting an employee to the house
is going overboard.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.760
Mom, that's no way to treat someone.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.500
I'm for it.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.240
I'm all for inviting Chef Kang.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.610
What do you think, Chairman?

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.880
I'm worried another hotel might poach him,

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.880
and I think Dream Group needs to do
whatever it takes to keep him.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.750
If that's the case,

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.550
go on and invite him over.
It's not a big deal.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.920
Yes! My grandpa's the best!

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.030
Just please, tell Jang Mi.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.170
You need to stop this too, Dad!

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.570
Look at you.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.710
My little Jang Mi
is finally starting elementary school.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.540
That backpack's so big.
Are you sure you can carry it?

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.550
- Can you?
- Yes.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:36.450
All right.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.250
- Jang Mi's going to school.
- She is.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.720
I'm coming with you.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.720
No, Mom, don't come.
I'm just going with Dad.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:45.860
You're embarrassing, Mom.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.330
Come on, Jang Mi.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.730
Mom should take you for your first day.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:51.930
I said no.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.680
Is it really true that
you're not my real dad?

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.820
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.660
You haven't heard
from Lawyer Kang Baek Ho, have you?

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.760
You want him to call me
and say he found that goon you hired?

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.630
Your guy, Ssangkal, was clearly captured
on the dashcam footage.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:06.500
- His giant scar makes him easy to spot.
- I told him...

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.910
to lay low and stay out of sight.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.240
If Oh Jang Mi's people get to him,
we're done for.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.250
I'm taking the car, so pull it around
to the front. You don't need to come.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.050
Where are you headed? I'll drive.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.550
I told you not to come.
Why do you make me repeat myself?

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.590
There are too many prying eyes
around here.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.030
And as for Professor Kang,

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.160
- he's a married man.
- Did I ask for your opinion?

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.470
- Since when is it your place to meddle?
- But if Chairman Ma finds out...

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.100
Get out. This is none of your concern.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.480
Jang Mi.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:49.880
Dad has something to tell you.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.220
Did you know too?

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.920
That I'm not his real daughter.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.450
You're still his daughter,

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.590
and you'll always be my sister.
Nothing has changed.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.790
Why does that even matter now?

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.160
Tae Pyung...

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.580
This is the last letter Suk Hee sent me.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.120
Bok Gil.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.920
I know you must be worried about me.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.230
But I'm doing just fine here,

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.630
so don't you worry about me.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.370
I hope Tae Sook and Tae Pyung
are doing well.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.330
I feel like I've always been
a burden to you,

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.040
but I'll find a way to repay you someday.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.010
Take care, Bok Gil.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.380
Bok Gil.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:03.350
I hesitated whether
I should tell you this or not...

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.790
for a long time.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.560
There's something that will be
a big surprise for you later.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.600
She's so beautiful that
I want to brag about her,

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.100
but I'll stop myself.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.770
She sent that letter
because she wanted to show you off.

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:26.110
I should've gone to see her sooner.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.480
It's all my fault.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.650
So...

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.350
how did you figure out...

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.450
that I was her daughter?

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:40.660
Suk Hee and I grew up
in an orphanage together.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:44.930
When I'd pick wildflowers for her,

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.470
she would say
that she didn't want to be...

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.540
like a common wildflower
that grows just anywhere.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.010
She wanted to be
the most beautiful, gorgeous rose.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.170
That's the kind of woman she wanted to be.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.010
That's why she studied relentlessly
for the bar exam.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.920
This lucky clover bracelet...

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.420
and the embroidery on the baby clothes.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.420
They were all your mother's symbols.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.730
I knew it the moment
I saw this bracelet on your wrist.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:20.360
That you were the daughter
she was so proud of.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.370
The police wrote her off
as a distraught single mother.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.540
They said she'd attempted suicide,
and they just closed the case.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.850
But I knew there was more to the story.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.790
Wait, why is there a baby here?

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.720
There had to be a reason
she hid you in that shed...

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.390
and had to flee in such a panic.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.060
What's a baby doing here?

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.870
Where's your mommy?
Why are you out here crying?

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.370
When I'm not around her,

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.740
my mom frantically searches for me.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:01.940
That's because she's scared
she'll lose me,

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.040
so she's trying to protect me.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.110
That's what Lawyer Kang told me.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.810
Exactly.
Deep in your mother's subconscious,

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.120
there was a powerful instinct
to protect you.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.850
Back then, the villa's caretaker said...

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.690
- Hello there.
- Hey.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:24.800
Here, this is for you.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.300
Oh, my. You bring such expensive gifts
every time.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.230
You really don't have to.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.940
Has anything new come to light?

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.140
Has anyone around here seen Suk Hee?

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.340
To be honest...

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:45.920
I've been hesitating to tell you this.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.450
Do you have some new information?

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:48.990
Well...

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:51.020
I saw it.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.260
- What did you see?
- The baby's mother.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.990
- What are you doing? Go after her.
- She was being chased by some thugs...

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.670
- Darn it!
- and running into those woods.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.830
I saw it happen that day.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.240
Why didn't you say anything back then?

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.240
If you had,

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.950
I could've caught the bastard
who did this to my Suk Hee!

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.380
Dad.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.990
All this time,
you've been through so much...

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.120
because of my mom and me. I'm so sorry.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.930
How could you say that?

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.560
You're hurting my feelings.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.270
Ever since I met you,

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.110
there's never been a moment
you weren't my daughter.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.380
Dad.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.840
I know.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.310
You must be curious
about your birth father,

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.750
but it's hard for you
to talk about, right?

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:58.420
But...

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.560
I have absolutely no idea
who your birth father is.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.700
Your mother only ever said that
she'd fallen in love with someone,

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.400
but she never revealed who he was.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.840
I'm curious too.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.270
And now that Suk Hee is like this,

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.410
there's no way to find out.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.580
That's not true, Dad.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.720
You're the only father I have.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:30.120
That's right.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.090
You are the daughter of my heart.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:38.930
No matter what anyone says,
you're my daughter.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.900
Dad.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.240
I'm sorry.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.150
- Tae Pyung. How's Jang Mi holding up?
- She's talking with Dad right now.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.050
I'm sure it's a huge shock.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.650
Make sure you take good care
of my Jang Mi.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.360
What? "My Jang Mi?"

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.190
- Hey, you have feelings for my sister?
- I don't know.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:11.730
I'm hanging up.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.100
What? I'm invited to Chairman Ma's house?

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.740
- It's awkward. I really don't want to go.
- What's awkward about it?

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.850
But this could be
a really great opportunity for you.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.480
Did Ma Seo Rin put you up to this?

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:35.250
No. I'm the one who pestered the Chairman
to invite you.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.820
I'm the one who went to all the trouble
of scouting you.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:43.430
I'd like to ride your coattails
to success a little,

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.760
so please, just this once, for me?

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.360
Cheers.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.440
He has gotten pretty good.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.740
I haven't seen him before.
It’s nice to listen to his singing.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:42.750
So, are you out of the woods now?
Hwa Young, you look well.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.290
There's always something new to deal with.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.390
It's like waves.
You get over one, and another one hits.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.470
How about we get away for the weekend?

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.770
Are you sure that's a good idea?

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.440
You're a married man.

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:05.180
Are you worried about me?

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.450
A trip? I don't know.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:11.950
Not just yet...

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.920
Did I get ahead of myself?

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:17.290
I'm sorry.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.020
Don't be sorry.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.460
My heart is always
right there with you, Professor Kang.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.030
Mine is with you too, Hwa Young.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.650
- Excuse me a moment.
- Yes.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.920
- We have a huge problem.
- What is it? Why are you here?

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:53.920
Oh Jang Mi says she's not studying abroad
and is coming to your office.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.090
What?

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.800
Contact Oh Jang Mi right now...

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.830
and tell her to meet me at a cafe,
not the office.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.730
Yes, I already took care of it.

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.410
Professor Kang, it looks like
I have a visitor,

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.610
so I should head back to the office.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.040
I'm so sorry.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:23.650
I am very sorry.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.270
Hello.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.880
Last time, you asked me to refrain
from coming to the office,

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.010
- so I contacted Manager Lee instead.
- I see.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.450
But I heard you decided
not to study abroad.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.090
- That's right.
- May I ask why?

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.920
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
for you.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.520
Tell me.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.590
Why the sudden change of heart?

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.660
Anyway...

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.870
I'm just not able to go.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.930
That's unexpected.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.940
Turning down such a great opportunity.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.670
Most people would kill
for an opportunity like this.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:19.780
Jang Mi, are you all right?

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.110
Talk to me.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.410
If there's anything I can do to help,
just let me know.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.820
Is it because...

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.760
it'll be hard to run the side dish shop
without you?

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.390
If so, I can even help
with your family's living expenses...

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:36.830
out of my own pocket.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.300
- Please, don't worry...
- Actually...

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.100
I just learned a secret about my birth.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.300
A secret about your birth?

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.340
I...

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:52.880
went my whole life without ever thinking
I wasn't my father's daughter.

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:55.610
It turns out I'm not his real daughter.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:02.250
Still, my dad paid Mom's hospital bills
after her accident...

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.060
and went through a lot to raise me.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.990
I can't go. It wouldn't be right.

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.030
You've seen my mom, ma'am, so you know.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.170
My mom used to be so brilliant,

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.600
but an accident left her like this.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:23.110
The person who did that to my mother.

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.310
I'm going to catch them
with my own two hands.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.780
Once I find them, I'll learn why and how
they did this to her.

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:32.680
I'm going to uncover the whole truth.
And I'm going to make them pay for it.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:55.910
(The First Man)

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.940
The lawyer helping Oh Jang Mi
is Kang Baek Ho.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.110
Are you dating someone, son?

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.650
Why am I thinking about
Oh Jang Mi all day?

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:07.250
I'm going to see this through
to the bitter end.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.190
You tramp!

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:12.120
I took you in off the street,
and it turns out you have no shame.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.920
I found out who he is.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.030
You must have a death wish.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.930
Oh Jang Mi,
you'll never uncover the truth.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.700
