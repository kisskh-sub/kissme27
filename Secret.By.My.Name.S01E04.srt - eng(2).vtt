00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.640
Young Chairman Tan.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.080
Inviting someone to talk business,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.240
and you will not even
offer a glass of Blood Oath?

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:38.560
Or is it that

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.481
you are afraid the name of this drink

00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:43.201
might stir up

00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:44.521
old memories?

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.240
What I mentioned to you,

00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:48.359
have you given it some thought?

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.480
Such a generous gift for me.

00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:53.201
Are you regretting the choice
you made back then, Young Chairman Tan?

00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:56.560
Or is this your way of making up
for my engagement gift all over again?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.559
Whether you can afford this gift,
depends entirely on what you are capable of.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.920
Young Chairman Tan.

00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:07.481
Do not worry.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.081
Even if it is just for your sake,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.520
I will give it a serious try.

Li Shujing.

00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:27.201
If you will not let me live,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.120
then today I will use this axe

00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:31.561
to send you down there,

00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:34.561
so your whole family can reunite.

00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:35.960
I knew it.

00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:38.201
Someone as foolish and vicious as you

00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:40.640
was bound to snap under pressure.

00:02:40.721 --> 00:02:42.960
Then I will make sure you go down first.

00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:05.840
Congratulations, you have just added
another charge to your record.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.319
I do not know if you are aware,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.799
but your precious son

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.761
has already blamed everything on you
to save himself.

00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:13.479
So tell me,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.201
would you rather
end it yourself with that axe,

00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:18.120
or wait for the police to arrive?

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.960
I have heard that people like you,
who sold toxic padding

00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:23.881
and killed infants,

00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:26.400
are especially popular

00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.960
once they are in prison.

00:03:28.161 --> 00:03:30.560
I will not end up

00:03:30.561 --> 00:03:31.920
like your coward of a father.

00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:34.601
Either you find the nerve to kill me,

00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:36.481
or else

00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:39.160
I will be outside
your window every night,

00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:40.601
until I drive you insane.

00:04:08.121 --> 00:04:09.080
Shujing.

00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:10.199
Ruining your life

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.240
over someone like him

00:04:11.241 --> 00:04:12.281
is not worth it.

00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:14.240
The revenge you want

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.680
is to let him live,

00:04:15.681 --> 00:04:17.881
and watch himself rot from the inside.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.881
Li Shujing!

00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:52.600
Do not regret this!

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.480
Sometimes I wonder
if you are only pretending to sleep,

00:05:00.561 --> 00:05:03.720
afraid that once you wake up,
you might let slip

00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:07.361
how you forced my father
to sign that contract.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.280
Breathe carefully.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.361
I want every breath you take

00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:35.720
to feel like shards
of glass in your throat.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.240
I want your final breath

00:05:39.241 --> 00:05:40.640
to be filled with regret.

00:06:04.921 --> 00:06:06.720
Ms. Li, your drawing has lost its edge.

00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:09.240
I remember when you taught me

00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:10.761
how to sketch the human form,

00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:14.040
you said the line

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.361
from collarbone to waist

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.441
was desire mapped in proportion.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.520
Young Chairman Tan, you remember well.

00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:25.720
Too bad you forgot the second half.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.960
Ambition without balance

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.160
can become the rope
that tightens on itself.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.241
You do look every bit
the ruthless business queen now.

00:06:38.561 --> 00:06:39.319
I just wonder

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.720
how long this performance
is meant to last.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.720
I plan to keep going

00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:49.720
until Young Chairman Tan

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.600
hands over everything I want.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.360
You once told me

00:07:01.361 --> 00:07:02.881
that manipulation never turns into love.

00:07:04.481 --> 00:07:06.121
Now I am giving you two choices.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.321
First option.

00:07:07.801 --> 00:07:09.120
Keep playing Tan Zuoyan's piece,

00:07:09.121 --> 00:07:10.400
and fight me to the bitter end.

00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:11.881
Second option.

00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:13.201
Tonight at eight.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.480
Come to the base.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.399
And make up for that proper date

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.400
you still owe me.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.880
Sorry, Young Chairman Tan.

00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:21.361
Tonight at eight,

00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:23.600
I am going wedding dress fitting
with your brother.

00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:29.201
All right.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.921
That is your choice.

00:07:35.681 --> 00:07:37.040
Ms. Li.

00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:38.400
I am Lin Xi,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.720
head of Lingxi Design.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.800
From now on, all materials

00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:44.360
for Ms Li's autumn winter line
will be supplied by us.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.761
We'll be working closely from now on.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.300
I look forward to working with you.

00:07:48.241 --> 00:07:50.241
Young Chairman Tan,
you really went to great lengths,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.321
rushing someone in so quickly

00:07:52.561 --> 00:07:53.520
to keep an eye on me.

00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:56.280
When it comes to you,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.881
I have always paid close attention.

00:08:07.681 --> 00:08:09.160
Every single thing about you,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.160
I pay close attention to.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.960
Young Chairman Tan,

00:08:16.001 --> 00:08:17.719
I did not expect

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.241
you to be capable of lines this cheesy.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.001
Are you that free?

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.640
If I were not,
how would there be a show to watch?

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.801
Enough talk.

00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:29.801
The share you want,

00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:32.321
you will not lose a single point.

00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:35.080
That is more like it.

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:36.361
Men

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.561
should be like Young Chairman Tan.

00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:40.160
That is when they are at their best.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.720
Good.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.000
Do not worry.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.201
Everything is moving forward as planned.

00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:54.321
The key point is

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.600
the new product must use

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:57.760
that new patented fabric you have.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.281
Wait for my signal.

00:09:00.587 --> 00:09:02.182
(Lin Xi)

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.099
I will hang up first.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.195
(Lin Xi)

00:09:07.837 --> 00:09:10.007
(Lin Xi)

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.320
Swimming at this hour?

00:09:27.321 --> 00:09:30.240
Miss Lin really does live like
a pampered heiress, sampling life for fun.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.639
Work is work,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.840
but rest matters too.

00:09:35.121 --> 00:09:36.519
I was waiting for Jianfei,

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.399
but waiting alone gets dull.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.000
So I thought

00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:41.041
I would invite Miss Li over for a chat.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:44.561
Miss Lin, what do you really want?
You might as well say it outright.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.919
You are not short on money anyway.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.801
Shujing,

00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:50.039
Tan Group has been
turned upside down by you.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.799
Can I not simply want to help Jianfei,

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.080
and help Tan Group?

00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:57.080
But what Tan Group
needs right now is change.

00:09:58.721 --> 00:09:59.760
Change?

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.080
Tan Group is a massive vessel.

00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:04.521
A ship that size does not turn easily.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.880
I have heard quite
a few stories about you, Miss Lin.

00:10:10.361 --> 00:10:11.760
And what do they say about me?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.161
A delicate rich girl,

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.921
focused only on marriage,
uninterested in the family business.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.840
A matchmaking and alliance specialist,

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.561
and things along those lines.

00:10:27.721 --> 00:10:28.760
Miss Lin,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.161
with your mind, you could
swallow half the business world.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.760
Why settle for being
a jewel-studded abacus,

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.880
only sounding off
when someone nudges you?

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.519
If someone else could
do the thinking for me,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.240
why would I play the strategist myself?

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.480
As for you, Miss Li,

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.039
you could have stayed overseas
as a well-paid designer,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.759
yet you chose
to return to this quagmire,

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.321
digging up Tan family secrets.

00:10:50.961 --> 00:10:52.000
Miss Li,

00:10:52.001 --> 00:10:54.760
you do not truly believe revenge
is a fairy tale, do you?

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.240
Miss Lin, you love cleaning up
other people's messes,

00:11:00.081 --> 00:11:02.360
just be careful not
to end up splattered with mud yourself.

00:11:03.321 --> 00:11:04.801
And what if I do?

00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:06.840
I can always change
into something clean.

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:14.960
Young Chairman Tan.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.401
Zuoyan.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.120
At the wedding,

00:11:45.321 --> 00:11:47.880
would it be better
if I walk in holding your arm,

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.641
or follow in your shadow down the aisle?

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.840
As long as you are happy,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.281
even if

00:11:58.321 --> 00:12:00.360
you step on my heart as you walk,

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.321
it is still fine.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.000
Shall we try another white gown?

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.521
Sure.

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:10.161
Then help me change.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.120
She suits black better.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.960
After all, when she is widowed,
there will be no need to change outfits.

00:12:19.601 --> 00:12:20.480
Jianfei.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.840
What brings you here?

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:24.840
I heard you had a date today

00:12:24.841 --> 00:12:26.041
with Lin Xi.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.201
Why are you two here?

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.720
Why else would we be?

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.161
I did not expect things
to move so fast between you and Lin Xi.

00:12:36.361 --> 00:12:37.600
Shujing and I

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.080
just got engaged not long ago,

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.201
yet you somehow beat us to it.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.521
You really are

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.360
naive.

00:12:44.121 --> 00:12:45.399
If you had been like this earlier,

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.281
Lin Xi would not have had to
chase after you so painfully back then.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.240
I was wondering, Jianfei,

00:12:52.241 --> 00:12:53.279
how you managed so quickly

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.041
to find such a reliable helper.

00:12:55.121 --> 00:12:57.480
Turns out there is history like this.

00:12:58.121 --> 00:12:59.641
That is quite unexpected.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.960
Mr. Yan,

00:13:03.961 --> 00:13:05.880
have you lingered here too long

00:13:06.121 --> 00:13:08.041
and forgotten you have
an emergency meeting?

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.720
I honestly

00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:15.161
did not know about that.

00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:16.880
What,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.639
are you arranging a special

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.600
last-minute meeting for me now,

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.921
Jianfei?

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.480
Exactly.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.161
I am the one who scheduled it.

00:13:30.121 --> 00:13:32.279
Gather everyone from Tan Zuoyan's
department immediately,

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.920
and add an emergency meeting
on the Autumn Winter Alpine Collection.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.521
You...

00:13:37.961 --> 00:13:39.120
Are you going,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.801
or not?
