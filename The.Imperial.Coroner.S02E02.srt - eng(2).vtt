00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:13.679
(Emperor's birthday.)

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.320
(This was my first time,
as the Commandery Princess Consort An)

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:17.490
(attending a palace banquet.)

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.559
(I was somewhat nervous.)

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:21.790
(Fortunately, everything went smoothly.)

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.920
(But I never expected)

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.380
(that a jumping human skull
would appear during the banquet.)

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.719
(Such a bizarre case occurred.)

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.079
(The deceased must be given justice.)

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.700
(Chu Chu did everything she could
to protect the skull)

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:35.870
(and preserve the evidence.)

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.799
(I also argued firmly on behalf
of the Three Judicial Offices,)

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.520
(and ultimately obtained
the authority to investigate the case.)

=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.700
(This story is entirely fictional.)

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.340
=The Imperial Coroner S2=
=Episode 2=

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.199
This spot looks like
it's been rubbed by something.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.280
Jinli.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:29.199
Here.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.280
There was a fight here.

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:38.800
Judging by the build,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.599
it should have been a man.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.039
Look.

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:50.319
This bead

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.319
was very likely shaken loose
during the struggle

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.240
from clothing or an ornament,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.520
and then pressed into the mud.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.439
I have seen beads like this before.

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.599
They are not valuable,

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.520
but they look
especially nice in sunlight.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.360
That is why many palace maids

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.639
sew them onto their clothes

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:05.599
or their shoes.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.000
So among the two who fought,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.039
one was a palace maid.

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.080
It's really stuck.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.879
Your Highness.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.759
Your Highness.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.680
Many of the bones scattered around.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.960
Quick.

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.680
Come help.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.639
Over there.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.319
Come here.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.930
Impressive, Chu Chu. You can still piece
the shattered bones back together.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.400
For Chu Chu, restoring skeletal remains
is nothing difficult.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.159
Our guess yesterday was correct.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.919
He did not fall into
the water by accident.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.180
How can you tell?

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.400
If we follow this parietal bone
and look at it against the light, here.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.500
There is a reddish blood halo
at the center of the fontanelle.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.919
And here as well.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.599
Faint traces of blood can also
be seen near the tooth roots.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.840
Blood marks on the fontanelle?

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.759
Does not the human head
already contain blood?

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.719
Blood is found in the flesh
or within the marrow,

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.060
but never on the surface of bone.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.240
You mean someone struck his head?

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:17.720
Not the head.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.439
Someone struck his lower body.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.439
The lower body?

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.800
(A severe blow to the lower body)
When a man's lower body is struck with great force,

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:27.759
(Sharp breath held in)
the intense pain causes him to gasp and hold his breath.

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:29.560
(Surge of blood and qi)
At that moment, blood and qi rush upward,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.519
(Fontanelle)
reaching the fontanelle.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.060
Injuries are therefore often found
near the tooth roots as well.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.199
And look here.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.319
The deceased's pubic arch is fractured.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.350
This could only have been caused
by an extremely strong impact.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.600
The person who fought with him

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.879
was able to strike his lower body
when he was off guard.

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:44.720
Judging by the force alone,

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:45.759
this person

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:48.000
must have had some martial training.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.920
Striking the lower body like this
is a particularly vicious method.

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.200
Whether it was vicious or not aside,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.519
this deceased man

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.040
is indeed rather unsettling.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.040
We have found something.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.600
There truly is a man in the palace

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.150
who has been missing
for about half a year.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.820
He was a guard, around 30 years old,
who often suffered from toothaches.

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:07.160
It was said he resigned
due to illness and returned home.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:08.560
His name was Wu Liang.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.519
Then the one in this pond...

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:12.040
General.

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:14.399
General.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.639
A blade was dug out of the mud.

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:17.759
The number on the saber
is Bing Twenty-Three.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.079
It belongs to Wu Liang.

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:19.740
(Bing Twenty-Three)

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.920
Were you close to him?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.839
Everyone

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:23.720
knew him.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.600
Over the past year,
no one knew where he got the money,

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.470
but he suddenly
became generous with spending.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.279
He often said that once he made it big,
he would quit.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.279
Later, he really did resign and leave.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.230
Who would have thought
that he would end up here?

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.360
Did he have any enemies
or close relations?

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.360
He liked lively company.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.879
With the others,
he generally got along well.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.660
But he was not especially
close to anyone.

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:45.079
As for enemies?

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:46.560
None that we know of.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.360
Do you know

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:49.319
when he was on duty for the last time?

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.680
It was November fifteenth of last year.

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.079
I remember it very clearly.

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:56.759
It was his final day on duty
before stepping down.

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:58.399
And he even arrived late.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.199
I thought he was about to leave anyway,

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.680
so I did not say much.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.590
I simply assigned him

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.519
to stand guard
by this inconspicuous rockery.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.000
Do you remember what I said last night
about Consort Hui,

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.759
the palace official,
and those palace maids?

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.230
Their reactions were all rather strange.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.360
Could it be that they already knew
about Wu Liang falling into the water?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.680
Judging from their reactions,

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:22.879
they most likely did.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.800
Anyone qualified to be a guard
must be highly skilled.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.160
So who could have struck him

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.990
without making a sound
and dealt a fatal blow?

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.079
This carved mark

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.800
matches perfectly with the wear

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.590
on the metal ornament of the deceased's
belt recovered from the pond.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.680
But judging from the depth
and direction of the marks on the ground

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.200
as well as the bead that was dropped,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.600
the deceased must have fought back.

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.759
The killer had some martial skill

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.279
and quick reflexes.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.790
Although they were briefly
overpowered by the deceased,

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:08.920
in the end they managed
to catch him off guard

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.680
and strike his lower body
with full force.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.240
Based on the width of the footprints
left on the stone,

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.170
the killer's stature was far smaller than
that of the deceased.

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:20.800
And the decisive blow
to the deceased's lower body

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.300
is precisely the kind of strike

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.390
a woman is most likely to succeed
with against a man.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.759
If the killer was a woman,

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:29.120
then based on our earlier deduction,

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.620
- the garden night on November fifteenth.
- The garden night on November fifteenth.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.480
All the palace maids present that night
include the killer among them.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.240
Rest assured.

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:37.120
With me here,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.800
as long as we narrow the scope,
we will find her.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.160
Then I'll go with Leng Yue
to see the palace official.

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:47.240
All the records are here.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.160
Commandery Princess Consort An.
Lady Jing. Please.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.560
Chu Chu.

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:11.959
Honestly, given
His Highness's reputation as it stands,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.360
a little extra swagger
doesn't really matter.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.319
Why not let the palace official
handle this directly?

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.079
What are you looking at?

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.319
Look.

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:28.279
The older volumes here are all
from about a year ago.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.959
The newer ones
are all from recent months.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.559
If we sort them roughly

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.720
by how old they look,

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.950
we should quickly find the records
from half a year ago.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.240
Not bad, Chu Chu.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.390
As long as it does not breathe,
you can figure it out.

00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:49.200
Your Majesty.

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:57.279
Commandery Princess Consort An
has been stirring things up

00:08:57.559 --> 00:09:00.080
in the palace all day, digging up bodies
and questioning people.

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:02.759
The inner palace
has always been orderly and calm.

00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:05.200
Now it has become a complete uproar.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.580
Has it still not been resolved?

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:07.799
Your Majesty.

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:08.600
Your Highness.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.620
Commandery Princess Consort An
requests an audience.

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:11.559
Let her in.

00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:16.600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.639
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:20.320
Chu Chu.

00:09:20.919 --> 00:09:22.720
I hear you have caused
quite a commotion.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.240
This is the imperial palace,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.360
not a marketplace.

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:27.159
When will you allow me some peace?

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.120
Your Majesty,

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:30.200
I have a way to find the culprit.

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:35.000
However, I will still need
Your Highness's assistance.

00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:37.039
What help do you need?

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:39.960
I wish to borrow
a few people from Your Highness.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.600
Everyone, please step forward.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.440
This Chu Chu

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.840
really does look the part.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.320
Is Jing Yi trying out
some new method of solving cases again?

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.590
His Majesty and Consort Hui
are both watching.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.200
He had better not make a mistake.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.840
Just set your mind at ease.

00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:32.390
Jing Yi knows what he is doing.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.440
Are you all right?

00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:24.879
I am fine, my dear.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.240
I was prepared.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.240
Look.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.759
Enough.

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:36.679
Your Majesty,

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:38.159
I have determined the truth.

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:42.440
Shi Qing. Will you still
refuse to confess?

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.919
Vice Minister Jing
struck first without cause.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.310
I merely acted in self-defense.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.440
What crime have I committed?

00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:49.919
The crime of killing Wu Liang.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.480
Your Majesty.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.480
On November fifteenth of last year,

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:57.039
(Wu Liang, a soldier of the Shence Army)
it was the garden night of Your Majesty and Consort Hui.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.399
It was also Wu Liang's
final day on duty.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.639
Because Wu Liang arrived late,

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:01.360
he was assigned

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.660
to stand guard near the rockery
where few people passed.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.039
Wu Liang and Shi Qing
encountered each other here.

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:07.759
For reasons unknown,

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.919
a dispute arose between them.

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:10.390
It quickly escalated into a fight.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.759
Although Shi Qing had some skill,

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:15.080
Wu Liang was, after all,
a Shence Army soldier.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.660
Shi Qing soon fell at a disadvantage
and could only struggle to hold on.

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:21.840
The two exchanged blows back and forth
inside the rockery cave,

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.790
leaving behind extensive
traces of their fight.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.759
However, both of them overlooked
a far more crucial fact.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.679
Within the imperial palace,
no matter how secluded a corner may be,

00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:32.320
patrol guards pass
through every half an hour.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.070
The two acted
with remarkable coordination,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.399
not making a single sound

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.039
and thus avoided the patrol guards.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.559
After the guards had passed,

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:50.660
Shi Qing seized the moment

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.430
and launched
a surprise attack on Wu Liang,

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.639
delivering the fatal blow.

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:03.519
Consort Hui.

00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:07.399
On the garden night
of November fifteenth last year,

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.759
Do you know

00:13:08.879 --> 00:13:09.919
Shi Qing's whereabouts?

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:11.679
Your Majesty,

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.159
I killed him.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.720
That day, Wu Liang spoke offensively
and humiliated me.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.250
I acted on impulse and struck him,
causing his death by mistake.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.159
Overcome with fear,
I dared not report it.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.590
That is why I concealed it until now.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.950
Her Highness knew nothing of this.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.480
I confess my guilt.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.080
I await Your Majesty's judgment.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:28.919
Your Majesty.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.000
Your Highness.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.279
I have failed Your Highness's
years of guidance.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.690
I only beg that Your Highness

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.890
for the sake of my many years
of service by your side,

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.799
show mercy to my family
outside the palace.

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:41.159
I would gladly serve Your Highness

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.300
with absolute loyalty,
even in another life.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.879
Since you are willing to confess...

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.720
Your Majesty.

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:51.440
I have something to say.

00:13:51.759 --> 00:13:52.240
Speak.

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:54.039
Even for an ordinary constable,

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.960
killing a person is no small matter.

00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:58.159
The fear lingers in the heart for years.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.000
Let alone a woman of the inner palace.

00:14:00.159 --> 00:14:01.600
If Shi Qing were truly the culprit,

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.690
she attended Consort Hui
at close quarters every day.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.799
Could Consort Hui
and the palace maids around her

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.600
really have noticed nothing amiss?

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.279
Shi Qing's confession

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.279
is vague and incomplete.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.639
It does not withstand scrutiny.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.320
There must be more to this.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:14.440
Your Majesty,

00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:15.840
do you still remember

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:17.679
Shi Qing shouting "insolence"

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.000
by the lotus pool?

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:21.279
We heard it clearly even from far away.

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:23.159
If, as Shi Qing claims,

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.519
she acted only
because Wu Liang harassed her,

00:14:25.759 --> 00:14:27.919
she would surely
have scolded him loudly first.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.120
Why did no one hear anything that day?

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.600
By your reasoning,

00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:33.960
there is indeed
more hidden in this case.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.559
If I am to render a judgment,

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.720
Chu Chu must examine one more person.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:38.919
Examine whom?

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:41.440
This happened half a year ago.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.519
Even if the suspect had been injured,
the wounds would long have healed.

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:46.840
At this point, would an examination
still be useful?

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:47.840
Your Majesty.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.240
Wounds may heal,

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.000
but traces of healing always remain.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.399
I am willing to examine.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:53.960
Your Majesty.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.470
It would be better to let Chu Chu
conduct another examination.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.080
This matter involves someone
close to Your Majesty.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.990
Only by verifying it thoroughly
can one be at ease.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.000
Very well.

00:15:01.639 --> 00:15:02.360
Chu Chu.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.399
Go and examine her.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.120
Yes.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.840
No matter how much you investigate

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.480
or how you examine me, to me,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.080
it only ends in death.

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:35.600
How you deal with me is
for palace law to decide.

00:15:36.159 --> 00:15:37.600
I am merely a coroner.

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:39.879
My duty is to verify the truth.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.080
So that palace law
has a proper basis for judgment.

00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:43.320
Therefore,

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.879
I will not wrong an innocent person,

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.399
nor will I let a guilty one go.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.990
Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.519
So you truly come from humble origins.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.840
Whether one comes from humble roots
or from a prominent household,

00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:59.480
the standards for examining injuries
and deaths are the same.

00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:00.480
Rest assured.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.799
I am not familiar with palace affairs,

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.919
but whatever you have endured

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:06.960
I will determine with certainty.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.000
Chu Chu.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.480
Have you found anything?

00:16:23.799 --> 00:16:24.639
Your Majesty,

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.639
there was more than
one culprit in this case.

00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:27.559
What?

00:16:28.159 --> 00:16:29.480
Was Shi Qing merely an accomplice?

00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:29.919
No.

00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:31.879
Wu Liang was also a perpetrator.

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:34.039
Wu Liang was a perpetrator?

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:35.279
I do not know

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:37.240
whether Wu Liang insulted Miss Shi Qing,

00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:38.720
but I know

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:40.639
that Wu Liang intended to kill her.

00:16:45.559 --> 00:16:48.000
There is a scar on the upper part
of Shi Qing's right arm.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.279
Judging by the degree of healing,

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:52.000
it dates back about half a year.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.639
From the angle and width of the wound,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.759
it was caused by a palace guard's saber

00:16:56.799 --> 00:16:58.240
swung upward from below.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.300
Leng Yue once said

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.900
that those trained in martial arts
first learn how to yield in defeat.

00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:03.840
For Shi Qing to shield herself
with her arm,

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.710
it must have been
a vital area being targeted.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.950
Judging from the difference in stature
between Shi Qing and the deceased,

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.079
that strike

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.240
was meant to end her life in one blow.

00:17:11.559 --> 00:17:12.519
In other words,

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.240
Wu Liang struck with lethal intent.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.720
It was not Shi Qing
who intended to harm Wu Liang.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.119
It was Wu Liang
who sought to kill Shi Qing.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.200
So Shi Qing delivered a fatal strike

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.759
only to protect herself.

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:24.519
That is correct.

00:17:25.519 --> 00:17:26.319
Shi Qing.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.160
I will give you one more chance.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.599
Explain yourself clearly.

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:32.160
Why were you in
such a secluded place that day

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:33.720
and why did you meet that guard there?

00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:34.880
And why

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.559
did he attempt to kill you?

00:17:36.839 --> 00:17:38.200
Tell the truth.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.759
You must not conceal anything further.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.920
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:45.180
That day, I went to fetch pastries.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.470
I happened to pass by that spot.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.039
He likely did not recognize me,

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:50.839
and besides, perhaps standing guard
all night had bored him.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.599
He began to harass me,

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.839
treating me as amusement.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.480
My resistance angered him,

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.160
and so he acted
in such an extreme manner.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.960
In that case,

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.400
why did you not call
for help at the time?

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.799
Your Majesty,

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.440
at that moment, you were strolling
the gardens with Her Highness.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.400
I did not dare disturb
the imperial presence.

00:18:12.039 --> 00:18:14.240
I also feared that vile man
would turn the blame on me,

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.640
tarnishing my reputation without cause
and implicating Her Highness as well.

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:18.559
Shi Qing.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.400
Did you push him into the water?

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.680
I did not.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.880
He fell in by accident.

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.440
Wu Liang struck at me
with lethal intent at every turn.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.079
I had no choice but to strike
his vital point to protect myself.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.640
The pain seized him,

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:32.960
and he tried to pull away from me.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.119
As he backed toward
the pond, he fell in.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.880
I was terrified at the time.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.559
I only wanted to tend to my wound

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.990
before Her Highness
returned to the palace.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.200
So I lied and said

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.559
that in the darkness

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.319
I had slipped and been cut by a stone.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.750
Her Highness did not suspect a thing.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.790
On the contrary,
she gave me many medicinal herbs.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.799
That is how it remained concealed.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.559
Your Majesty.

00:18:57.079 --> 00:18:59.759
Shi Qing has served me for many years
with loyalty and diligence.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.600
Although there was fault in this matter,

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.960
it was that reckless man
who first harbored ill intent.

00:19:04.359 --> 00:19:06.039
I beg Your Majesty to show mercy

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.880
and spare Shi Qing's life.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.640
A life for a life

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.279
is the way of heaven.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:15.960
Your Majesty.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.359
It was the guard
who acted improperly first

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.920
and then sought to silence her.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.799
Shi Qing acted only in self defense,

00:19:22.039 --> 00:19:23.240
with no intent to harm.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.079
According to the law,
she should not be sentenced to death.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.320
Commandery Princess Consort An.

00:19:27.519 --> 00:19:28.519
This is the inner palace.

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:30.880
A palace maid
and a guard entangled improperly,

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.839
whether or not she was at fault,

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:34.119
she bears responsibility.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.920
Since the evidence is conclusive

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.319
and she has confessed,

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:38.759
- then...
- Your Majesty.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.660
Your birthday celebration
has not yet concluded.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.370
Envoys from all directions and officials
from across the realm are still present.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.390
It may be better to hand this matter
over to the Palace Domestic Service

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.690
and decide it after the festival.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.400
Hm.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.160
Grant death after the festival.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.599
Thanks Your Majesty for your grace.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.799
Your Highness.

00:20:04.519 --> 00:20:06.480
Should we not
have investigated this case?

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.160
Matters have right and wrong,
cases have truth and falsehood.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.960
We bear the responsibility

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.359
to reveal the truth impartially.

00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:14.480
And guided by conscience,

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.799
to seek, within the law,

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:17.720
the best possible outcome
for those involved.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.839
So uncovering the truth
was not your mistake.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.599
Besides, this case is not yet concluded.

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:30.079
Do you remember how I asked you today
to pay attention to Shi Qing's injuries?

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.039
Check carefully whether Shi Qing
had suffered any violation.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.039
Understood.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.119
I examined her.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.200
There was indeed none.

00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:45.359
This shows Wu Liang did not violate her.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.340
Shi Qing was the chief palace maid
in Consort Hui's household.

00:20:48.359 --> 00:20:49.490
She held considerable standing.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.990
And always conducted
herself with composure.

00:20:51.759 --> 00:20:54.039
If it had been nothing more
than verbal provocation,

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.520
she would have had many ways
to extricate herself.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.640
Yet it escalated
into a fight to the death.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.359
She had no prior close dealings

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.759
with that guard.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.359
So why did she rush to confess
in front of His Majesty?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.400
Shi Qing was lying.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.200
She was concealing something.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.440
Exactly.

00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:15.180
His Majesty pressed her so hard,

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.260
even declaring she would
be executed after the festival.

00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:18.520
Yet she never changed her story.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.839
What could possibly

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.759
be more important than her own life?

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.480
Could it be her family's lives?

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.400
That seems unlikely.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.839
She has lived in the palace for years.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.039
What could possibly happen

00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:33.599
that would endanger her family outside?

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.319
Unless…

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:40.279
She was stealing valuables
within the palace

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.599
and then

00:21:42.119 --> 00:21:43.920
having them smuggled out to be sold.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.440
So the guard discovered her theft,

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.359
and was silenced because of it.

00:21:51.359 --> 00:21:52.400
Today, when Leng Yue and I

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.480
checked the records
in the palace, we found

00:21:54.839 --> 00:21:56.799
that items have
been going missing frequently.

00:21:57.359 --> 00:21:59.470
Consort Hui had previously ordered
the palace official

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.890
to investigate, but nothing came of it.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.720
In truth,

00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:05.799
palace servants stealing valuables

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.000
has existed in every dynasty.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.640
It has simply become especially serious
in the past half year.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.960
The splendor and luxury
within the palace

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.359
appear dazzling,

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.279
but they have nothing to do
with low-ranking eunuchs and maids.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.480
Especially in recent years,

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.960
with the treasury strained,

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.690
palace expenditures have
been cut again and again.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.039
Naturally, they would want
to take valuables

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:27.400
to secure a way out for themselves.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.400
Especially when palace maids grow older
and are released from service,

00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:33.240
if they have nothing set aside,

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.000
they would not even know how to survive.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.279
Your Highness.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.240
If there were any other choice,

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.359
who would risk execution

00:22:41.559 --> 00:22:42.880
to steal palace property?

00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:47.240
So you suspect this
is connected to Shi Qing?

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.200
But

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.799
she is the chief palace maid
by Consort Hui's side.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:55.570
There was no need for her to do that.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.839
I know.

00:22:58.039 --> 00:23:00.920
I just cannot understand
why Shi Qing and Wu Liang

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.039
would fight each other to the death.

00:23:05.359 --> 00:23:07.079
Whatever the hidden truth may be,

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.759
His Majesty clearly does not wish
to pursue this matter further.

00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:13.880
The chances to investigate it in depth

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.039
will likely be very slim.

00:23:19.319 --> 00:23:19.839
Chu.

00:23:22.519 --> 00:23:24.200
Did you marry the Commandery Prince An,

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.270
or did you marry
the Three Judicial Offices?

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.680
He.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.160
I am doing just fine.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:38.990
From now on,
living in the Prince's Manor,

00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:40.200
we will be relying on you.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.240
Today, I will host.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.240
You came from afar,

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.740
and the two of us have not yet had
the chance to entertain you properly.

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:47.519
Order whatever

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.440
you like today.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.319
This place may not be luxurious,

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.839
but the flavors are truly first rate.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.300
Palace matters have been many,

00:23:54.319 --> 00:23:55.880
and we kept you waiting for a long time.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.340
Stir-fried lamb with scallions. Qingfeng rice.
Huai-leaf cold noodles. Gourd chicken.

00:23:59.359 --> 00:24:00.780
Cheese cherries. Flower-folded goose cake.

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:01.990
Crystal dragon-and-phoenix cake.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.759
That will be all.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.200
Wait.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.500
Add two more servings of steamed cakes.

00:24:06.839 --> 00:24:07.290
No problem.

00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:07.920
He.

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:09.440
Why did you only order what I like?

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:10.990
You should order something
you enjoy too.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.759
I just thought
I would try a different taste for once.

00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:14.759
A different taste.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.559
Please enjoy.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.799
Eat more.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.190
Your face has grown so thin
there's hardly any flesh left.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.119
The food here
still can't compare to home.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.839
This time, I brought
a lot of local specialties from home.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.580
Enough for you to eat for a year or two.

00:24:31.599 --> 00:24:32.160
He,

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.319
look carefully.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.599
I'm not thin at all.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.920
He is right.

00:24:37.759 --> 00:24:38.759
You work day and night.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.880
You really should eat more.

00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:40.640
Exactly.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:41.599
Eat.

00:24:43.359 --> 00:24:45.359
He, this time you came to the Capital,

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.680
why did you bring so many things?

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.500
It must have been
such a hassle on the road.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.079
Just tell me, do you like them or not?

00:24:51.599 --> 00:24:52.200
I like them.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.720
I knew it.

00:24:54.039 --> 00:24:56.039
Things from home always suit you best.

00:24:57.039 --> 00:24:57.680
Come, He.

00:24:58.839 --> 00:25:00.119
This is fine Willow Leaf Wine.

00:25:00.559 --> 00:25:01.400
Let me toast you.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.200
Come.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.880
My brother...

00:25:03.319 --> 00:25:04.000
Casually

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.720
will do.

00:25:08.599 --> 00:25:10.720
This bit of wine is
nothing worth mentioning.

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:13.720
Men of Qianzhou
can all handle their drink.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.000
As for why I like steamed cakes,

00:25:21.559 --> 00:25:22.759
the truth is

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.599
Chu Chu likes them.

00:25:25.119 --> 00:25:25.920
She

00:25:26.559 --> 00:25:28.200
did not dare tell Father,

00:25:28.599 --> 00:25:29.880
so I took the blame for her.

00:25:30.359 --> 00:25:31.359
Who would have thought

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.559
she could keep eating and eating,

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.000
until just smelling steamed cakes

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:37.680
made me feel sick.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.720
My younger sister

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.799
has a stubborn nature.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.279
When she likes something,
she never tires of it.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.920
And when she sets her heart on someone,

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:50.480
it is for a lifetime.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:57.720
He.

00:26:03.319 --> 00:26:04.000
My brother

00:26:04.119 --> 00:26:05.640
usually can't handle strong liquor.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.839
One cup and he is done.

00:26:07.359 --> 00:26:08.640
And it really was just one cup.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:15.559
My Lady.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.330
- Where is Vice Minister Jing?
- Right here.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.599
What are you doing up in the tree?

00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:22.240
Surveying the whole scene.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.680
Thinking it through as a whole.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.680
Skipping work
and still sounding confident about it.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.230
The case is already closed.
It is just a matter of procedure now.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:34.960
Boring as can be.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.510
Let us go in and take a look.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.680
This person
really lived without restraint.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.440
Exactly.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.039
Things were left scattered everywhere.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.880
When we arrived,
it was already like this.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:57.620
(Footprint size, gait, mulberries)

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.780
(All consistent)

00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:06.000
That is not right.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.570
Someone has searched this place.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.920
More than once.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:14.960
What do you mean?

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.799
Spring mud from the third month.

00:27:18.359 --> 00:27:19.240
Spring mud?

00:27:19.759 --> 00:27:20.240
Look.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.359
These fine strands
are peach blossom stamens.

00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:24.930
What does that tell us?

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.079
It means someone came here when
the peach blossoms were in full bloom.

00:27:30.599 --> 00:27:31.680
Come take a look at this.

00:27:36.119 --> 00:27:36.720
Bloodstains?

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:38.519
Mulberries.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.990
They were abundant last month,
but the season has already passed.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.559
The key point is,

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.759
judging from the footprint size
and the gait,

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.720
these two sets of footprints

00:27:49.799 --> 00:27:51.000
were left by the same person.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.599
The same person?

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.599
They came once
during peach blossom season,

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:59.519
and came again
when mulberries were ripening.

00:27:59.559 --> 00:28:02.519
That means after Wu Liang died
three or four months later,

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.839
someone searched this place once,

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.160
failed to find what they wanted
and would not give up,

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.759
then searched again last month.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.640
There must be something here
they desperately wanted.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:12.680
That does not add up.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.039
Every wall and every brick here

00:28:15.119 --> 00:28:16.480
was carefully tapped and checked.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:23.960
There was no problem.

00:28:35.759 --> 00:28:36.400
My dear.

00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:38.160
Do you not think this wall...

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:38.839
Seems off.

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:54.319
This is already the edge of the house.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.359
This space is…

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.440
Is Wu Liang trying
to become a Chess Attendant?

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.359
He is relentlessly training in Xuansu.

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:17.160
But with Xuansu,

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:19.759
the four star points around the center,

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.240
why is that area worn down so badly?

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:37.820
(The chessboard mechanism.
The four star region is severely worn)

00:30:03.279 --> 00:30:04.880
This is no private residence.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.400
It is clearly a private treasury
of the inner palace.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.990
I will report this to the Prince.
This case cannot be closed.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:12.799
Your Highness.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.400
All of these
were found in Wu Liang's home.

00:30:19.759 --> 00:30:20.400
Exactly.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.660
He was hidden extremely well.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.000
I obtained from Consort Hui

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:24.200
(One jade hairpin. One silver hairpin)
a list of missing items.

00:30:24.359 --> 00:30:25.960
These are all on that list.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.079
Earlier you discovered
at Wu Liang's residence

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.359
that someone entered
the house twice after his death.

00:30:34.759 --> 00:30:35.990
Has that person been identified?

00:30:36.079 --> 00:30:37.359
We questioned the neighbors,

00:30:37.559 --> 00:30:39.079
but no one saw anyone going in or out.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.480
However, after thoroughly clearing out
everything in Wu Liang's home, we found

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:44.359
(Five pouches. Eight letters)
that he had no silver at all.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.640
I suspect it was just a petty thief.

00:30:46.759 --> 00:30:47.920
After succeeding once,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.460
he ran short of money again,
and came back to try his luck.

00:30:54.559 --> 00:30:56.599
But these are all items
used in the inner palace.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.200
A mere guard like him

00:30:58.319 --> 00:30:59.960
could not even enter the palace halls.

00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:01.880
They could only have come

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.839
from palace maids or eunuchs.

00:31:05.599 --> 00:31:06.440
A palace maid.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.599
Could it really have been Shi Qing?

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.839
She was Consort Hui's chief palace maid.

00:31:12.279 --> 00:31:13.690
She could enter every palace freely,

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.370
and no one would dare
search her lightly.

00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:17.240
Stealing something would have been easy.

00:31:18.839 --> 00:31:20.079
She went unnoticed at first,

00:31:20.599 --> 00:31:22.160
until Wu Liang happened upon it.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.950
Seeing the valuables, Wu Liang
grew greedy and tried to blackmail Shi Qing.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.890
In her panic,
Shi Qing killed him to silence him.

00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:28.319
That explains everything.

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:33.559
For Shi Qing to do this

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.240
was both to preserve
the larger situation

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.359
and out of fear...

00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:46.150
Fear that someone with ulterior motives
would drag Your Highness into it

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.200
and damage your reputation.

00:31:47.559 --> 00:31:48.400
Reputation?

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.240
Shi Qing is about to lose her life.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.200
What reputation
do I have left to speak of?

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:55.839
Your Highness.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.400
Shi Qing has already confessed.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.660
There is no room for reversal.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.370
If Your Highness
hesitates again and again,

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.190
the Three Judicial Offices
may sense something amiss

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.300
and pursue the matter further.

00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:04.990
By then, none of the palaces
will escape implication.

00:32:05.599 --> 00:32:07.490
At that point, Shi Qing
will have died in vain,

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.880
and her confession
will have meant nothing, Your Highness.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.400
When Shi Qing is taken away,

00:32:18.119 --> 00:32:19.440
go and see her off for me.

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.720
Send more silver to her family as well.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.180
She has a widowed mother
and younger siblings at home.

00:32:24.319 --> 00:32:25.400
I fear that in the future,

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.680
life will be hard for them.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:27.839
Yes.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.190
From now on,
enforce palace regulations strictly.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.680
If there are any further thefts,
punish them without leniency.

00:32:33.039 --> 00:32:34.200
As for what happened before,

00:32:35.079 --> 00:32:36.319
I will let it pass.

00:32:36.599 --> 00:32:37.799
Your Highness is kind hearted,

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:39.240
only then can such leadership

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.839
by example produce maids like Shi Qing,
loyal and full of feeling.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:42.720
On their behalf,

00:32:43.319 --> 00:32:44.240
I thank Your Highness

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.200
and Shi Qing.

00:32:45.759 --> 00:32:46.240
You're back?

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.720
What did you find?

00:32:49.839 --> 00:32:51.720
We recovered some items from Wu Liang.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.100
Within the palace, clothing,
food, and daily provisions

00:32:56.119 --> 00:32:57.200
are all strictly regulated.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.960
But these pouches and handkerchiefs

00:33:00.079 --> 00:33:01.880
are made of very coarse fabric.

00:33:02.279 --> 00:33:04.359
They are rewards
given only to palace maids.

00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:07.079
(To my Wu Liang, personally opened)
Yet palace maids wear uniform attire in daily life,

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.440
so these must have been sewn privately.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.720
They are all personal items,

00:33:10.759 --> 00:33:12.000
nothing of real value.

00:33:12.279 --> 00:33:13.759
Shi Qing would not have stolen these.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.400
Could it be that Wu Liang stole them?

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.680
He did have that habit.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.359
More likely,
they were given to him in secret

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.359
by palace maids.

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:20.839
Yes.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.839
Because we also uncovered
several private letters of affection.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.390
The handwriting
differs from letter to letter,

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.240
so they were written
by different people.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.079
Wu Liang was nothing more than a guard,

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.060
yet he managed
to captivate so many palace maids.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.440
What?

00:33:33.759 --> 00:33:35.480
You sound rather envious.

00:33:36.359 --> 00:33:38.160
Do you want to learn from Wu Liang?

00:33:39.119 --> 00:33:40.359
I despise that kind of man,

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.640
fickle and incapable of devotion.

00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:46.640
We cannot jump to conclusions.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.240
There is no evidence
that Wu Liang replied to them.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.720
Among these letters and items,
is there anything from Shi Qing?

00:33:53.119 --> 00:33:53.640
No.

00:33:54.119 --> 00:33:55.160
We compared the handwriting

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.759
in Shi Qing's testimony with the letter,

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.319
and they don't match.

00:33:58.559 --> 00:34:00.680
So Shi Qing never wrote to him.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.519
From the way Shi Qing spoke of Wu Liang,

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.720
there was only disgust and hatred.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:09.600
It truly did not seem like
she ever liked him.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.639
So there are two things
we must now find out.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.440
First,

00:34:13.559 --> 00:34:16.290
how these palace maids' belongings
ended up in Wu Liang's possession.

00:34:16.599 --> 00:34:17.079
Second,

00:34:17.559 --> 00:34:18.800
who the palace maids were

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:20.700
that wrote these letters.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.800
Shi Qing will not speak again.

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:25.320
So,

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.280
these items

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:28.039
are our only remaining clues.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.599
You should think this through carefully.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
From His Majesty

00:34:33.039 --> 00:34:34.239
down to the palace maids,

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.800
no one wants this investigated.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.320
What you are doing
may earn no gratitude.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.159
Investigate it.

00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:47.790
When the Three Judicial Offices
handle a case,

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.880
we seek only fairness.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:50.960
That's great.

00:34:51.559 --> 00:34:52.960
Then I'll go with Chu Chu right now

00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:54.790
to track down the palace maids
who wrote to Wu Liang.

00:34:55.039 --> 00:34:55.480
Mm.

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:08.599
What?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.490
It's only been half a day,
and you already miss her that much?

00:35:11.639 --> 00:35:12.440
Leng Yue.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.960
It's already late today.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.330
By the time you arrive,
the palace gates will be locked.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.680
Going tomorrow will be soon enough.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.480
Exactly.

00:35:20.559 --> 00:35:21.639
I'm starving already.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:22.440
Your Highness.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.980
How about adding two more places
at the Prince's Manor today?

00:35:25.679 --> 00:35:26.199
No.

00:35:26.599 --> 00:35:27.519
How can there be none?

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.880
I clearly heard you tell
Wu Jiang this afternoon

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.239
to go to Guangtai Tower to buy...

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.679
Buy what?

00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:36.360
Am I

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.400
supposed to know or not know?

00:35:41.039 --> 00:35:42.400
I suddenly realized

00:35:42.599 --> 00:35:44.039
that during the Emperor's birthday,

00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:45.320
Chang'an has no curfew,

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.990
so it's inevitable that some troublemakers
might take advantage.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.870
In case the Jingzhao Prefecture
are stretched thin,

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.679
you might as well help with patrols.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.239
I really do not think that is necessary.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.440
It is not that I am being lax.

00:35:55.639 --> 00:35:56.920
I am worried Jiang Daohai will

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.800
like a hawk, keep staring at me again,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.300
afraid I might steal his credit.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.960
It doesn't matter.

00:36:02.679 --> 00:36:04.000
It is all service to the state.

00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:06.400
Patrol every street and alley carefully,

00:36:06.519 --> 00:36:08.159
and make a detailed record.

00:36:08.519 --> 00:36:10.559
Bring it to me personally
tomorrow morning.

00:36:11.159 --> 00:36:11.840
Your Highness...

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.519
Go.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.119
Rest assured, Your Highness.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.360
Tonight I will keep my eyes on him
every step of the way.

00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:24.860
Thank for the hard work, Jing Yi.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.400
Not hard work.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.599
Just hard on the heart.

00:36:30.519 --> 00:36:32.079
Why did you suddenly punish him?

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.599
I am not only punishing him.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.119
I am punishing you as well.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.800
Me?
