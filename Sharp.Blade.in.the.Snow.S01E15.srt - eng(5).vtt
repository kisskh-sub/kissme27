[Sharp Blade in the Snow]

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.950
[Episode 15]

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.650
Yun Zhan has been
serving you quite attentively.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.680
Although Yun Zhan
has a willful temperament,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.340
he wouldn't dare
neglect Your Majesty's order.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.880
Is this wound new?

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.880
It was me who stole Your Majesty's favor,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.640
so Yun Zhan resents me.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.360
Whatever beating or scolding I receive
is deserved.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.320
I only hope

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.200
Attendant Yun

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.860
doesn't resent Your Majesty.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.120
Your Majesty,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.560
this is freshly brewed calming decoction.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.560
I heard you couldn't sleep at night,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.600
so I brought this specially for you.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.440
You're a new court lady?

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.520
Yes.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.840
I'm Ruo, just transferred
to serve at the Fengxi Palace.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.039
I only arrived today.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.479
I am apprehensive but honored

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.200
to have this duty.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.320
Your Majesty,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.420
this decoction...

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.440
was prepared for you.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.400
I pity his severe injuries.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.200
What's wrong with
granting him this bowl of soup?

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.820
The injury is on your body,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.700
but the pain is in my heart.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.280
Here,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.960
quickly,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.200
drink it,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.860
so you can sleep well tonight.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.720
I don't deserve this.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.040
This is poison.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.320
What should I do?

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.320
The little girl you've been
thinking of day and night,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.920
whom you feel so indebted to,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.840
is actually me.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.840
I recognized you long ago.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.170
Never mind just a bowl of tonic,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.440
once we acknowledge each other,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.480
even the position of Imperial Consort
could be yours.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.280
Your Majesty,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.320
do you mean it?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.840
Of course.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.640
Alright.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.720
I'll risk it.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.640
One bowl of medicine
for the position of Imperial Consort.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.240
Worth it.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.360
Your Majesty,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.400
I've been searching for you
so desperately.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.320
From now on,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.400
I will never leave your side,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.280
not even half a step.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.960
Demon Lord!

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.140
Prepare to die!

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.120
Watch out!

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.840
I never thought you would

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.700
sacrifice yourself to shield me.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.650
Don't worry,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.440
I won't leave you behind.

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:38.880
Your Majesty.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.200
Are you treating my words

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.900
like they're nothing but air?

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.000
Just a mere male concubine.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.360
Who do you think you are?

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.540
Your Highness,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.410
by what authority are you ordering me?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.240
Ridiculous.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.880
Let me go.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.200
Let me go!

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.400
You love me so much.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.280
Since we cannot share a bed in life,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.720
perhaps we can share a grave in death.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.780
Wouldn't that fulfill your wish too?

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.880
Every debt has its debtor.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.000
She's the one you want to kill.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.360
It has nothing to do with me.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.560
How could you say such heartless words?

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.660
Have you forgotten

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.280
the times we shared hardships
in our youth?

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.080
Does the Demon Lord
still hope for genuine feelings?

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.160
How pathetic.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.120
You, who willingly debase yourself,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.400
have shamed

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.960
those in the underworld...

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.200
Attendant Yun,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.280
please put in a good word for me.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.720
I knew you would come.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.000
Guards!

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.000
Yes.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.560
There's an assassin.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.280
The assassin disguised as a court lady

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.520
and conspired with Yun Zhan

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.720
to assassinate me.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.720
Arrest him

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.320
and take him to the death cell.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.840
What did you say?

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.280
Yes.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.000
Move!

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.690
[Wutong Palace]

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.860
Last night's incident

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.240
has left me heartbroken beyond words.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.400
Attendant Xiao Ze

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.800
was truly my beloved.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.720
He died in my chamber

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.440
protecting me.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.120
My condolences, Your Majesty.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.200
Attendant Xiao's loyalty and bravery
are evident.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.400
He died with honor.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.159
Prime Minister Bai is right.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.500
The brave and loyal

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.840
shall be recorded in our nation's history.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.240
I will never forget this.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.200
Your Majesty,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.720
according to our investigation,

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.600
the palace token
used by last night's assassin

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.040
came from the Fengling Palace.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.160
Nonsense!

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.280
Ling'er is my closest kin.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.160
Someone must be framing her.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.640
Your Majesty cares deeply for your sister,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.400
but Princess Ling

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.060
has repeatedly
spoken disrespectfully to you.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.840
Who else in Mocheng would dare be so bold?

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.490
We implore Your Majesty

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.200
not to aid the wicked.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.280
But the day after tomorrow

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.600
is the day when the Xiqi delegation
comes to receive the bride.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.799
What shall we do?

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.640
You all make valid points.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.289
Allow me some time to think.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.120
For now, seal off the Fengling Palace,

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.240
guard it strictly,

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.720
and await the investigation's results.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.520
Yes.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.200
My Lord,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.880
His Highness has been imprisoned

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.000
on charges of attempting
to assassinate the Queen.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.320
His life is in grave danger.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.600
If they truly intend to kill him,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.800
once His Highness loses his life,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.520
the bloodline of Dongli

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.840
will end in Mocheng.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.440
Shall we raid the prison

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.840
and rescue His Highness?

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.080
Do not act rashly.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.760
Mocheng is heavily guarded.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.080
His Highness is now
the personally designated rebel

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.800
by the Queen of Mocheng.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.860
Do you really think

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.490
he could escape from there?

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.080
But if something happens to His Highness,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.080
wouldn't our decade of planning
collapse overnight?

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.660
You think I don't want to save him?

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.240
He's the Crown Prince of Dongli,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.760
the bloodline
I would protect with my life.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.760
But now

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.700
is not the time for us to make our move.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.240
If we move recklessly

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.210
and alert the palace defenses,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.120
do you want to see
our decade of infiltration

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.780
and the sacrifice of hundreds

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.610
all exposed in a single day?

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.840
Yun Zhan is the Crown Prince.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.210
He should understand what's at stake.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.760
If the Queen wanted him dead,

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.620
she could have done it yesterday.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.260
The fact that she hasn't acted yet

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.440
suggests she might still
harbor some feelings for him.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.240
This is our last chance.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.250
If the Queen shows no mercy
to His Highness...

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.530
Then he can only rely on himself

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.800
to find a way to survive.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.160
From now on,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.240
everyone proceeds as planned.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.640
No rash actions.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.560
If the Queen truly intends to kill him,

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.280
only then

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.760
will be the time for us to act.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.680
As you command, Lord Lu.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.380
It's the first time
I've seen you so dispirited.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.360
How have you been lately?

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.720
Interesting.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.730
Shouldn't I be the one asking you that?

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.800
The poison in your body...

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.640
Don't worry.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.540
I grabted all those

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.260
medicinal soup to Xiao Ze.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.440
Not a single drop was wasted.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.800
You knew it was poison,

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.960
and he was your old acquaintance.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.020
Old acquaintance?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.530
He was nothing but a coward.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.410
When we parted at the wasteland years ago,

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.960
he didn't even leave me
a word of explanation,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.240
just abandoned me.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.880
His return

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.840
was merely to pay his debt.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:52.720
So

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.320
you hated him,

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.720
toyed with him,

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.520
then killed him with your own hands.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.960
Those who betray me

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.280
have only one fate.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.440
Death.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.360
So that's it.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.520
Your Majesty,

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.760
the envoy from Xiqi
has arrived at the palace gate,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.160
requesting an audience.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.480
Also,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.890
it's time to send him on his way.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.280
I see.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.360
You have indeed
shaken my heart several times.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.400
After we part today,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.490
we shall never meet again in this life.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.360
[Wutong Palace]

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.920
Announce the Xiqi envoy for an audience.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.680
Your Majesty,

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.040
you've been delaying our departure

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.640
and now imprisoned Feng Ling'er.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.960
Feng Ling'er
is the future Princess of our state.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.800
This marriage alliance

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.720
concerns diplomatic relations
between our two states.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.050
Your Majesty's actions

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.360
are clearly deliberate delays.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.200
Moreover,

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.160
isn't this all too calculated?

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.440
Princess Ling is suspected of
colluding with assassins

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.360
and is now detained
by the Justice Department awaiting trial.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.920
You demand her release.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.720
Are you trying to shelter a rebel,

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.720
colluding with Princess Ling

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.240
to take my life

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.360
and then get Mocheng

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.440
as a dowry to your Xiqi?

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.200
Xiqi wants a marriage alliance,

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.480
not interference
in governance or accusations.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.040
If you refuse the marriage alliance,
you'll be breaking our agreement,

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.360
showing complete disregard for Xiqi.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.640
You'd better consider

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.300
the consequences carefully, Your Majesty.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.950
[Liuyun Palace]

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.760
It looks as beautiful
as Sister's back then.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.360
It's exactly the same,

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.520
yet why don't I feel

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.840
as happy as Sister did back then?

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.200
What's still missing?

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.320
A child.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.560
Li.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.320
Your Highness, please spare Li.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.280
You and the late Queen were twin sisters.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.120
Li shares

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.640
the same blood

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.960
as you.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.240
Yu,

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.290
you're being too careless.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.720
Does it hurt?

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.560
Li isn't like Sister.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.700
She's more like me.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.880
She's arrogant, ruthless,

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.480
and extremely calculating.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.720
I love her deeply,

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.080
so how could I let her disappear?

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.520
I just want

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.840
the Phoenix Incense's formula
and the Phoenix Seal.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.080
I want to experience

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.800
everything Sister once had.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.180
Do you understand?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.360
I'm giving you another chance.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.880
Be her Imperial Consort.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.720
After marriage,
the Queen and her Imperial Consort

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.560
will jointly hold the formula.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.200
Are you willing to join her

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.040
in this beautiful union?

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:01.840
I...

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.400
May I?

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.140
But Her Majesty...

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.880
You love her so much.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.020
Of course I will find a way to help you.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.060
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:13.960
But now,

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.720
you need to help me with one thing.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.920
What is it?

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.920
My man

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.280
is still missing a pair of eyes.
