WEBVTT

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.000
Why do you ask this?

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.719
The only thing I can be sure of now

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.959
is that this Colonel Takeki

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:43.040
is a graduate of the Shanghai Tung Wen College.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.920
He should be a disciple of former Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro.

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:49.319
I see.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.000
Prime Minister Konoe's investigation agencies

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.480
all belong to the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.760
There are also some that belong to

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.239
the Konoe Fumimaro family's private investigation organs.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.799
For example,

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.519
located in the Broadway Mansions in Shanghai,

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:06.640
the East Asia Political and Economic Research Institute.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.599
Located on Sichuan Road,

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.400
the Shanghai East Asia Research Association.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.719
And,

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.159
run by Mainichi Shimbun President Fukamachi Sakuji,

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.560
the Nichimori Institute.

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.840
Managed by Tateishi Shunzo,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.120
the Yamazaki Institute.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.280
These institutions are all theirs.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.120
Then what about the Cabinet Secretariat faction?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.280
The Secretariat faction?

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.199
These are all rumors.

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.800
The Shanghai Asia Development Service Association,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.879
the East Asia Tung Wen Society Shanghai Branch,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.319
the Dong Jing Tung Wen College Investigation Committee,

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.800
the Shanghai Municipal Research Council, these institutions,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.599
are said to be

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.360
Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro's

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.199
privately controlled investigation agencies.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.599
I'm not too clear about their missions.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.039
The intelligence from these institutions

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.520
is never reported to the Military or the Imperial General Headquarters.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:56.960
I see.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.280
Oshima-kun,

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:02.520
I think you might be

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.199
overcomplicating things.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.599
I'll give you an idea.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.879
Do you remember the Ministry of Finance's

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.719
Vice Minister Taiei Shuichi?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.719
The Sixth Section.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.680
He currently

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.800
manages the entire budget of the Dong Jing Metropolitan Police Department.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.560
He is the God of Wealth for the Police Department.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.840
Send him a telegram.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.599
Ask him to send an official

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.199
from the Police Department's Sixth Section.

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.560
Wouldn't that hand this matter over?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.400
The Sixth Section?

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.840
Yes.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.000
The Counter-Espionage Section.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.000
If this Colonel Takeki

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
really has problems,

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.199
finding out will be the Police Department's credit.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.240
If the investigation is wrong,

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.639
then naturally it would be the Police Department's fault.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.360
So that's it.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.960
Eat more.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.960
Okay.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.800
It's all very delicious.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.959
It was my negligence.

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:30.879
I didn't notice his motorcycle

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:31.879
was parked right in the yard.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.839
Can your body hold up?

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.639
No problem.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.959
Can you do it?

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.000
Stay with Ju'er

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.399
and come help me push the vehicle.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.199
Yes.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.680
Sit tight.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.800
Push hard, push hard.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.759
Yes.

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:59.639
Open the front for me.

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:00.120
Yes.

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:11.040
Help me hold this side.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.480
Yes.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.199
Hold it here.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.800
Yes.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.040
What are you looking at?

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.639
Hurry up.

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:21.360
Yes.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.759
Close it.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.720
Yes.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.920
Go help me push the car.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.560
Yes.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.519
Put some effort into it.

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:30.040
You find a safe place to hide.

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:31.079
Wait for us here.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.199
We will be back as soon as possible.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.759
Comfort Tang Ju'er.

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:42.839
Tell her to be brave.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.240
I will come back as soon as possible.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.560
Mmh.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.519
Witt, come on.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.200
Let's stop here.

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:07.159
There's an aircraft signal tower on the peak.

00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:08.840
It's manned during the day, but not at night.

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:10.960
Behind the mountain is a construction battalion's barracks.

00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:12.960
This place is relatively the safest.

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:16.320
Can you hold on?

00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:18.039
I can hold on.

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:19.200
Come on.

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:20.360
I'll go call Xia'er.

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:21.879
No need, Fourth Grandma. Sit.

00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:25.639
Sit down.

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:33.480
That Xia'er...

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.519
He's lost his appetite completely.

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:38.720
He hasn't eaten a grain of rice since morning.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.840
He shouldn't ruin his health by starving.

00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:44.360
Fourth Grandma.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.159
Yes?

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.639
Look at that flower.

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:54.320
People are just like flowers.

00:10:55.799 --> 00:10:57.000
Take this potted flower for example.

00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:00.320
If you don't water it every day...

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:02.080
And don't take care of it carefully...

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.480
With just a little negligence...

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.519
It will wither.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.519
And when that happens...

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:08.399
You will regret it.

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:10.519
That when it was in full bloom and beautiful...

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:11.960
You didn't cherish it properly.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.240
I understand Xia'er's thoughts.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.639
He is someone who considers the big picture.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.200
He thinks of others in everything he does.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.159
But...

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.519
Regarding his relationship with Ju'er...

00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:29.039
He's overthinking it.

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:32.200
But whether it's me...

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.200
Or Tang Bingchen...

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.039
We have no right to interfere forcibly.

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:38.679
Young people's affairs...

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:40.879
Should be decided by themselves.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.600
Master.

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:47.559
Then why don't you go tell Longxia?

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:54.080
A boy...

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.679
Needs to grow up on his own.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.360
Struggle on his own.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.759
Only then can he figure things out.

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:12.480
Your son...

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:15.320
You really know him best.

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:16.879
Eat up.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.080
Why aren't they back yet?

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:30.240
Could something have happened?

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:32.840
Don't worry.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.919
Takeki is the most reliable person I've ever met...

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.679
And the one who knows best what he's doing.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.399
Takeki is quite good.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.759
If only he...

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.720
Wasn't Japanese.

00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:55.200
Ju'er.

00:12:56.919 --> 00:12:58.559
What my brother said last night...

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.720
Don't take it to heart.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.919
He didn't mean it.

00:13:14.799 --> 00:13:16.399
How can I not take it to heart?

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:18.960
He doesn't like...

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.519
That I work in the Japanese hospital.

00:13:21.879 --> 00:13:22.679
He doesn't like that my dad...

00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:24.080
Is the president of the Peace Preservation Association.

00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:26.879
But what could my dad and I...

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.120
What choice did we have?

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.200
Your brother can't treat me like this.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.000
After he said it...

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.320
He regretted it very much himself.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.600
He...

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.399
He really didn't mean it.

00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:40.519
Those were just words spoken in anger.

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:41.320
Words spoken in anger?

00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:43.879
How could he treat...

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.919
This matter as a joke?

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.759
Yes.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.399
It was wrong of my dad to go confront him.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.679
But he shouldn't have just accepted it.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.879
If I were in his heart...

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.759
He wouldn't have agreed so easily...

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.559
To call off our engagement.

00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:05.120
Without the engagement...

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.679
Between us...

00:14:10.759 --> 00:14:12.240
There is no relationship anymore.

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:13.519
Ju'er.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.360
Don't say such angry words either.

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:18.480
How about this.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.039
I'll go back and have a good talk with my brother.

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:23.960
He really doesn't think that way.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.120
You have to believe me.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.039
Don't you believe me anymore?

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:48.200
It's them

00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:49.960
They're back

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.080
Are you all right?

00:14:56.519 --> 00:14:57.320
Come on

00:14:57.639 --> 00:14:58.320
Come up, quick

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.320
Thank you, Nurse Tang

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:05.200
When we get back to the hospital later

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.039
try to relax

00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:07.120
Just like usual

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:08.919
Can you manage that?

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.159
Let's go

00:15:16.759 --> 00:15:17.519
Be careful

00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:30.279
Looks like the talk went well

00:15:33.679 --> 00:15:34.360
Let's go

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:17.600
Are they all asleep?

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.320
Yes

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:24.960
Give me a hand

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.279
Thanks

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.679
Nurse Tang

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.200
Nurse Tang

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:51.600
Can I talk to you?

00:16:58.159 --> 00:16:59.120
Are you still thinking about

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.960
what happened this afternoon?

00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:02.360
Yes

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.160
My mind is full of images from today

00:17:09.519 --> 00:17:10.599
No matter how busy I am

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.000
scene after scene

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.720
just flashes through my mind

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.599
Are you afraid?

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.319
You're a nurse

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.400
You should know that

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.480
when a person is under high stress

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.000
the limbic brain mobilizes your body's

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.279
various systems

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.759
to freeze your memories

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.480
Inside your brain

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.160
those flashing scenes

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:41.000
will make you, when encountering others,

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.119
even more panicked

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.759
Yes

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:49.079
I know

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.480
So what should I do?

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.960
I need you to

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.960
forget what happened this afternoon

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.559
Forget that disgusting Inoue Kamakura

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.160
I want to forget, too

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.400
But I just can't

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.839
Nurse Tang

00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:08.839
Do you know what we rely on

00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:10.240
to strengthen our memories?

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.400
Sit down

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:29.079
We rely on association.

00:18:30.079 --> 00:18:31.359
If

00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:33.640
we need to forget quickly

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.480
certain things,

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.000
we also rely on association.

00:18:38.759 --> 00:18:40.519
We force ourselves

00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:43.480
to think about family,

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.920
parents,

00:18:47.119 --> 00:18:48.400
and the people we love.

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:51.559
Or our future.

00:18:52.839 --> 00:18:55.039
Every step we'll take,

00:18:55.839 --> 00:18:58.079
imagining every detail.

00:18:59.119 --> 00:19:01.279
This way, we can gradually forget

00:19:01.839 --> 00:19:03.519
the things we want to forget.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:06.400
But I don't want to think of my dad.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.000
Thinking of him

00:19:10.599 --> 00:19:12.680
also upsets me.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.640
Brother Longxia...

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.519
there are many reasons

00:19:25.119 --> 00:19:26.400
we can't be together.

00:19:26.839 --> 00:19:28.519
Nurse Tang, listen to me.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.359
Don't think about those

00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:34.000
reasons keeping you apart.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.000
Force yourself

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.200
to think about

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.839
a future where you two are together.

00:19:42.279 --> 00:19:44.839
Think about after the Japanese leave,

00:19:44.839 --> 00:19:46.519
every day you will spend.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.160
The more detailed, the better.

00:19:49.839 --> 00:19:51.839
This way you can gradually forget

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.599
what happened this afternoon.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.839
Ye Longxia...

00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:00.839
I've met him.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.559
He's a good man.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.759
You will be happy together.

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:10.839
I can see you like him very much.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.880
Since you like him,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.279
don't worry about the reasons.

00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:20.079
You should fight for it bravely.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.039
I hope you can have this love.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.480
I wish you the best.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.160
I also hope

00:20:31.839 --> 00:20:33.880
to have such a chance.

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.079
You will.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.680
In the future,

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.920
when I have other problems,

00:20:42.839 --> 00:20:44.240
can I come ask you too?

00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:45.359
Of course.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.119
If you have any problems,

00:20:48.119 --> 00:20:49.519
you can come to me anytime.

00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:53.960
Get some rest now.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.480
Okay.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.599
Thank you.

00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:22.480
Colonel.

00:21:23.839 --> 00:21:24.480
The reason I came to see you this time...

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.720
is actually about another matter.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.480
What matter?

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:29.480
We have come up with a plan.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.519
Planned for April 12th.

00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:32.680
Which is six days from now.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.599
Under the guise of lifting the sea ban for fishing.

00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:35.759
To do what?

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.640
We plan to let over 260 people on Sanzao Island...

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.759
go out to sea to fish.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.160
Our plan is...

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.759
to wipe them all out at sea.

00:21:42.559 --> 00:21:43.839
Killing so many at once...

00:21:43.839 --> 00:21:46.480
won't that cause a public backlash?

00:21:46.759 --> 00:21:47.519
No.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.000
We've done it several times on the island.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.720
This is the last batch.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.599
After eliminating these 260-plus people,

00:21:54.319 --> 00:21:56.079
the island will be at peace.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.599
So,

00:21:59.119 --> 00:22:00.519
what do you need me to do?

00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:02.599
Sasaki.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.400
Yes, sir.

00:22:04.599 --> 00:22:06.319
Regarding our Navy's 6th Air Base,

00:22:06.319 --> 00:22:07.839
threats come from three sources.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.119
Please take a look.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.839
First, the island's...

00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:18.079
radical, strong young natives.

00:22:18.079 --> 00:22:20.079
Second, the triads from Macau's Eighth District.

00:22:20.079 --> 00:22:20.839
Over these years,

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.680
they have constantly raided us on the island.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.000
Over forty of the Emperor's soldiers...

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.119
have sacrificed their lives because of this.

00:22:25.599 --> 00:22:27.279
Third, after the Battle of Humen,

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:29.319
those disguised as merchant ships in Macau,

00:22:29.319 --> 00:22:30.920
the Chiang regime's gunboats.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.960
Our plan is to kill three birds with one stone.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.640
To solve these problems once and for all.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.240
Tell me what you need from my end.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.839
Colonel.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.680
The telegram you sent me a few days ago said...

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.079
you turned an insider from An Lan Tang.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.160
There is such a person.

00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:48.480
I need...

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.400
to secretly leak our intelligence to him.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.480
The families of An Lan Tang members...

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.000
are currently still on the island.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.000
If we reveal our intelligence to them,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.359
they will definitely come to the rescue.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.400
We'll seize this chance to wipe them out at once.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.680
That can be done.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.599
One more thing.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.279
It would be best to also find a way...

00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:11.519
to let those Chiang regime ships hiding in Macau...

00:23:11.519 --> 00:23:13.079
get wind of this news as well.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.880
I can figure out a way for this too.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.519
And one more point.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.400
How An Lan Tang in Macau...

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.400
and these unruly people on the island...

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.519
communicate with each other.

00:23:25.079 --> 00:23:27.640
We can find a way for all of this.

00:23:32.839 --> 00:23:33.880
Then I am very grateful.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.519
I will do my best to help you.

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:39.559
Oshima-kun.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.839
It's getting late.

00:23:43.599 --> 00:23:45.319
Go back to your hotel and rest early today.

00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:47.880
This plan of yours...

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.240
I will study it carefully tonight.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.680
Thank you for your trouble.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.599
We'll discuss the rest tomorrow.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.640
Then I will take my leave.

00:23:56.599 --> 00:23:57.559
Take care.

00:24:00.079 --> 00:24:00.920
Yamaguchi.

00:24:01.359 --> 00:24:02.200
Yes, sir.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.400
Escort them back to the hotel.

00:24:05.039 --> 00:24:05.960
Thank you for today.

00:24:06.079 --> 00:24:06.640
Yes, sir.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.000
This way, please.

00:24:08.839 --> 00:24:09.359
Take care.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:36.920
Thank you for today.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.400
Please rest early, Your Excellency.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.839
I'll pick you up first thing tomorrow morning.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:41.880
Thank you for your trouble.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:42.839
Yes.

00:24:43.359 --> 00:24:44.200
Oshima Hiroshi.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.519
Great.

00:24:51.839 --> 00:24:52.839
Where are you going?

00:24:56.519 --> 00:24:58.160
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

00:24:58.559 --> 00:24:59.359
Master Geng.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.680
A few years ago, they killed people on the island.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.599
I crawled out from a pile of dead bodies.

00:25:04.119 --> 00:25:04.960
There's no mistake.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.279
It is Oshima Hiroshi.

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:07.359
My wife and children...

00:25:07.359 --> 00:25:08.720
...all died at his hands.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.359
I'd recognize him even if he were burned to ash.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.319
How many of them came?

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.720
Two.

00:25:15.079 --> 00:25:16.279
Someone drove them here.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.720
He left after dropping them off.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.000
Are you sure there are two?

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:19.839
I'm sure.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.559
Reward him.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.519
Master Geng.

00:25:26.119 --> 00:25:27.000
I don't want a reward.

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:29.000
I only beg you to kill that villain.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.319
Avenge my wife and children.

00:25:31.319 --> 00:25:33.680
Avenge our dead compatriots.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.480
I am willing to serve you like a slave.

00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:37.359
Get up.

00:25:39.599 --> 00:25:40.480
You go out first.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.880
Leave this to me.

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:42.880
Yes.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.160
Handle a few things for me.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.079
First.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.839
Take some men personally and go tonight...

00:25:53.839 --> 00:25:55.319
...to the Lisboa Hotel.

00:25:55.319 --> 00:25:57.400
You must find out about that Oshima Hiroshi.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.039
How long he is staying.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.839
What he is doing in Macau.

00:26:00.839 --> 00:26:02.079
How he got here.

00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:03.319
And when he is leaving.

00:26:03.319 --> 00:26:03.759
Yes, sir.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.039
Second.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.759
Send someone to find Haozi tonight.

00:26:08.319 --> 00:26:09.519
Tell him to bring his weapon.

00:26:09.519 --> 00:26:11.079
And bring a few men to see me.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.640
He is a sharp shooter and skilled in martial arts.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.119
This time...

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.480
...it is time for him to use his skills.

00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:19.920
I'll arrange for someone to find him right away.

00:26:20.119 --> 00:26:21.119
This time...

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:23.640
No matter what, we cannot let those two guys...

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.359
...return to the island alive.

00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:26.200
Master.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.599
Don't worry.

00:26:27.759 --> 00:26:29.119
I'll go arrange it now.

00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:48.240
By doing this,

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.839
will we really be safe?

00:26:50.839 --> 00:26:51.599
Not necessarily.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.640
Oshima Hiroshi will soon discover

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.559
that Inoue Kamakura may have died

00:26:56.559 --> 00:26:58.240
before being pushed off the cliff.

00:26:58.839 --> 00:27:00.039
If that happens,

00:27:00.039 --> 00:27:01.519
he will trace Inoue Kamakura's

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:02.880
movements throughout the day.

00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:04.000
Very quickly,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.839
the hospital will come into his view.

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:07.720
And when Inoue Kamakura was at the hospital,

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.160
we happened to be there too.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.960
That creates an intersection point here.

00:27:11.599 --> 00:27:13.680
So we will become the prime suspects.

00:27:14.319 --> 00:27:15.400
No need to worry too much.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.519
Because there is someone who can prove

00:27:17.519 --> 00:27:19.000
that Inoue Kamakura drove his motorcycle

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:19.960
away from the hospital.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.000
In that case,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.359
Inoue Kamakura left the hospital alive.

00:27:23.599 --> 00:27:24.759
Then the significance of this intersection

00:27:24.759 --> 00:27:25.839
ceases to exist.

00:27:26.079 --> 00:27:27.359
You mean that sentry.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.359
What are you looking at?

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.119
Hurry up.

00:27:36.119 --> 00:27:36.480
Yes.

00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:38.680
The sentry's testimony will be in our favor.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.920
But Oshima Hiroshi may not fully believe it.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.960
He will also investigate

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.119
everyone who had contact with

00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:44.279
Inoue Kamakura today.

00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:46.720
Including Juer and me.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.519
Correct.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.559
Tang Juer is our weak point.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.079
She is honest and timid.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.680
If she panics,

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:57.759
everything will be in trouble.

00:27:57.759 --> 00:27:58.880
That is what I'm worried about too.

00:28:01.119 --> 00:28:02.200
She is on the night shift today.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.759
Why don't we go back and talk to her?

00:28:03.759 --> 00:28:04.319
Absolutely not.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.559
That would just give Oshima Hiroshi evidence.

00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:08.759
The Major will work on her

00:28:08.759 --> 00:28:09.920
tonight.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.759
He is a professional agent.

00:28:11.759 --> 00:28:13.319
I believe he will take that into account.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.960
Can what happened today

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.839
be told to my dad and brother?

00:28:21.839 --> 00:28:22.240
Yes.

00:28:22.839 --> 00:28:24.400
Let them be mentally prepared.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.160
Tomorrow when Juer gets off work,

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.680
have your brother bring her over.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.000
We'll talk to her in detail then.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.559
Stop thinking about it.

00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:36.519
So much happened today.

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.519
Get some rest.

00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:56.039
Right here.

00:28:58.039 --> 00:29:00.000
You guys keep watch right here.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.559
Didn't you see this person?

00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:02.759
Keep your eyes peeled.

00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:03.599
No sleeping.

00:29:03.839 --> 00:29:05.680
Don't let him get away from me.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.720
Don't worry.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.839
I won't let him run.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.519
Hello.

00:29:25.519 --> 00:29:26.559
Hello, sir.

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:27.759
How may I help you?

00:29:29.319 --> 00:29:30.559
Our master

00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:32.359
has a guest staying here.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.000
I would like to see

00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:37.279
your registry.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.480
Okay.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.160
No problem.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.599
Please go ahead.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.559
Dad.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.000
What are you thinking about?

00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:26.519
"A lifetime of vicissitudes cannot wash away,"

00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:30.279
"the surviving Three Martyrs still leave a fragrance."

00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:36.640
Are you going to lecture me on the "History of Song" again?

00:30:38.279 --> 00:30:38.960
Oh, my.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.160
It seems that lately,

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.759
you haven't just been reading "Water Margin".

00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:45.839
That sentence you just said,

00:30:45.839 --> 00:30:48.720
is the couplet on both sides of the Yashan Three Martyrs Shrine hall.

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:50.680
It is recorded in the "History of Song".

00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:53.960
It's not that I don't like reading these books.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.880
I just think reading them is useless.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.920
How can it be useless?

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.079
History is like a mirror.

00:31:04.519 --> 00:31:06.880
Reading history makes one wise.

00:31:07.039 --> 00:31:09.480
You can learn from the past to know the future.

00:31:11.839 --> 00:31:12.640
The future?

00:31:13.359 --> 00:31:14.960
But what can the future hold?

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.839
You read these books,

00:31:16.839 --> 00:31:18.519
and they can make you a civilized person.

00:31:18.519 --> 00:31:20.839
But right now, it is a barbaric era.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.839
Look at these Japanese on the island.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.720
Can we use civilized means

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.200
to drive them out?

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.960
In the face of barbaric invaders,

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.240
many people only seek self-preservation.

00:31:36.599 --> 00:31:38.279
They can give up anything.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.839
We have reached the moment of national survival,

00:31:40.839 --> 00:31:42.319
the most critical moment.

00:31:44.119 --> 00:31:46.400
The Japanese have blockaded China's routes,

00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:48.839
and have almost

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.720
cut off the Chinese government's

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.519
access to all channels of foreign aid.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.519
Chiang Kai-shek can only

00:31:56.519 --> 00:31:58.400
hold out in a corner of the Southwest.

00:32:00.319 --> 00:32:02.759
If this continues,

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.519
China will be in danger.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.240
Tell me,

00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:14.680
Takeki and Ying'er,

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.400
are they serving the Kuomintang,

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.079
or serving the Communist Party?

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.839
She doesn't want to say,

00:32:23.359 --> 00:32:24.759
and I don't want to ask too much.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.599
But speaking from my heart,

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.319
I actually hope

00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:34.599
she is working for the Communist Party.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.519
This party

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:40.359
has vitality,

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.279
and has faith.

00:32:47.319 --> 00:32:48.880
I don't care about the outside world,

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.759
and I can't control it either.

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:51.880
Dad,

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.079
I'll just stay with you.

00:33:04.079 --> 00:33:05.720
After a person dies,

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.000
they turn into a star.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.880
If the one who misses him

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.559
sees a star streak across the sky,

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.960
it means the one missing him

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.480
is thinking of him.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.000
Ju'er,

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.359
in the sky of our Sanzao Island,

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.480
not a single star is sad.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.599
On the day the Japanese leave,

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.119
and everyone in the country is free,

00:33:31.559 --> 00:33:33.839
we can truly be together,

00:33:34.359 --> 00:33:35.640
and never be apart.

00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:45.480
Dad.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.240
This war was invented by humans.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.519
Dad.

00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:50.000
Brother.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.640
You're back.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.279
Yeah.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.480
Have you eaten?

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.240
Not yet.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.119
I'll ask Granny Si to prepare something for you.

00:33:57.119 --> 00:33:57.880
Okay.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.559
Let's go.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.920
We had Major Witt

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.640
go to the hospital to replace him.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:10.360
Are you all right?

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.280
I'm fine.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.679
Inoue's disappearance...

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:19.320
is a big deal.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.519
The Japanese will surely investigate to the end.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:23.679
You must warn Takeki.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.039
Tell him to be careful.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:26.639
Don't give himself away.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.320
Guard against their retaliation.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.840
Understood.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.480
You be careful too.

00:34:34.559 --> 00:34:35.360
Ying'er.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.920
Is Ju'er all right?

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.559
Can I go see her now?

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.320
She was frightened.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.840
But...

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.880
she's safe and sound.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.039
That Inoue...

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:49.679
committed many crimes.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.920
He deserved to die.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.960
Take it to my brother's room.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.000
I'll eat there.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.719
I need to talk to my brother.

00:34:58.719 --> 00:34:59.400
Okay.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.480
No need, no need.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.480
Put it here.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.079
Put it here.

00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:02.559
Okay.

00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:04.519
Don't trouble Granny Si.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.840
You two talk.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.599
What I told you,

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:16.840
remember it.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.199
Mm-hmm.

00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:18.239
Be careful yourself.

00:35:19.039 --> 00:35:19.920
I will.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.480
Okay, goodnight.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.000
Goodnight, Dad.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.480
Mm.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.079
Dad, get some rest early.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.599
Ying'er.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:30.760
Right now,

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.840
is Ju'er still angry with me?

00:35:35.079 --> 00:35:36.079
No, she isn't.

00:35:37.239 --> 00:35:38.920
She's worried you don't want her anymore.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.039
Did she tell you

00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:43.519
to come and talk to me?

00:35:47.679 --> 00:35:48.320
Brother,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.639
is this the first time in your life

00:35:50.679 --> 00:35:51.760
that you've felt the feeling

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.639
of constantly worrying about someone?

00:35:55.239 --> 00:35:56.119
Yeah.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.039
A little bit.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.840
Before, I just thought

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.960
I'd stay on the island with Dad,

00:36:03.079 --> 00:36:04.360
and do my filial duty.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.840
If I could leave the island one day,

00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:08.880
I'd surely be able to show what I can do.

00:36:09.679 --> 00:36:12.000
Besides Dad and you on this island,

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.239
there wasn't anything

00:36:13.239 --> 00:36:15.239
worth missing or worrying about.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.079
But now there's one more person

00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:19.880
who makes me worry constantly.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.840
That's Ju'er.

00:36:23.159 --> 00:36:23.920
In the past,

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.000
I was always avoiding

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.639
the feelings between us.

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:29.599
But time and again, she

00:36:29.599 --> 00:36:31.280
helped me regardless of the danger.

00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:34.559
I just don't want

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:36.119
to drag her into this anymore.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.719
But sometimes,

00:36:38.719 --> 00:36:40.079
when I think of her dad,

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.920
I think I should just let it go.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.719
But look at me now,

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.119
I feel really awful inside.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.719
What?

00:36:54.039 --> 00:36:54.880
Brother,

00:36:55.719 --> 00:36:57.639
I think you've really fallen for Ju'er.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.000
Not because of the engagement.

00:37:03.199 --> 00:37:04.400
Then tell me,

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.840
what should I do now?

00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:07.840
If I take a step forward,

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.039
I'm afraid of dragging her into danger again.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.239
But if I take a step back...

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.480
You can't step back anymore.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.400
If you do,

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.159
she'll really think I don't want her.

00:37:17.679 --> 00:37:19.840
Stop saying those high-sounding words.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.320
About being afraid to involve her.

00:37:22.559 --> 00:37:24.079
You just can't swallow your pride

00:37:24.079 --> 00:37:25.519
and go apologize.

00:37:26.239 --> 00:37:27.239
Let me tell you,

00:37:27.239 --> 00:37:28.840
Ju'er is braver than you.

00:37:29.079 --> 00:37:30.400
If it weren't for her today,

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.519
the consequences...

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.559
who knows what would have happened.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.960
Master.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.360
Master.

00:38:11.639 --> 00:38:12.360
Master.

00:38:13.079 --> 00:38:15.239
Haozi's brothers are all here.

00:38:15.639 --> 00:38:16.840
But we can't find Haozi.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.800
Xin'an Tea House on Fulong New Street.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.639
Did you go there?

00:38:19.639 --> 00:38:20.760
We went there.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.679
He's not there.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.800
Send more men.

00:38:24.199 --> 00:38:24.960
Go look again.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.719
Yes, Master.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.119
Go find him, quick.

00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:28.480
Yes. Go, go, go.

00:38:31.239 --> 00:38:32.400
How is the situation on your end?

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:32.960
Master.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.039
We've got the situation clear.

00:38:35.119 --> 00:38:36.960
They really only brought two people.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.840
One is Oshima Hiroshi.

00:38:39.679 --> 00:38:41.119
The other is named Sasaki.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.320
They booked a suite with beds in both rooms.

00:38:45.159 --> 00:38:47.239
They plan to leave tomorrow afternoon.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.159
Good.

00:38:50.719 --> 00:38:52.480
We make our move tomorrow.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.360
You can't sleep.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.760
Keep your eyes open and watch closely.

00:39:28.239 --> 00:39:29.880
Don't let him slip away.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:30.760
Don't worry.

00:39:53.719 --> 00:39:54.280
Big Brother

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.039
Big Brother

00:39:55.039 --> 00:39:55.760
Shh

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.599
Keep it down

00:39:57.039 --> 00:39:57.679
Where is Master Geng?

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.239
Master Geng

00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:06.039
What have you been up to lately?

00:40:06.639 --> 00:40:08.400
I never see you around.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.119
I had people looking for you all night.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.760
Where did you go?

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.039
I had a few too many last night.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.679
On Fulong New Street...

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.719
...I was sleeping at Liangji Zhai.

00:40:33.239 --> 00:40:35.360
I've kept you around for a moment like this.

00:40:36.519 --> 00:40:38.280
Now is the time I need you.

00:40:39.239 --> 00:40:40.400
Can you do it?

00:40:41.159 --> 00:40:42.360
If not, I'll find someone else.

00:40:42.719 --> 00:40:43.480
I can.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.239
Don't worry.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.920
The things you order...

00:40:47.159 --> 00:40:48.159
When has Haozi ever not...

00:40:48.159 --> 00:40:49.480
...handled them beautifully for you?

00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:54.760
Speak.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.159
It's like this.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.719
An enemy of ours...

00:40:59.719 --> 00:41:00.639
...has come to Macau.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.480
He's staying at the Hotel Lisboa right now.

00:41:05.519 --> 00:41:06.679
Which enemy is it?

00:41:07.159 --> 00:41:08.320
I already scoped out...

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.719
...their lodging and route last night.

00:41:11.719 --> 00:41:12.679
Their room...

00:41:13.079 --> 00:41:14.280
...is booked until this afternoon.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.599
So...

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.159
...I reckon this afternoon...

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.239
...they'll go to the fishing pier...

00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:20.880
...and leave on a Japanese Fuda Trading Company ship.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.840
...and leave on a Japanese Fuda Trading Company ship.

00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:24.760
The Master's will is...

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.000
...that these two must not return alive.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.800
What's his name?

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.679
This man is called Oshima Hiroshi.

00:41:33.039 --> 00:41:35.079
He's the one from our hometown, Sanzao Island...

00:41:35.079 --> 00:41:37.400
...the head of the Japanese Special Police Unit.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.320
The massacre a few years ago...

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.119
...and in the last couple of days...

00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:42.679
...the deaths of brothers Dahu and Xiaohu...

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.360
...were his doing.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.119
The opportunity has come.

00:41:48.119 --> 00:41:49.519
He delivered himself to our doorstep.

00:41:51.039 --> 00:41:52.599
I want to use this villain's blood...

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.280
...to pay tribute to our dead villagers...

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.880
...and our brothers.

00:41:59.039 --> 00:41:59.719
Master Geng...

00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:01.079
...where do we strike?

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.320
The hotel is too crowded, hard to act.

00:42:04.199 --> 00:42:05.679
Go wait halfway.

00:42:06.119 --> 00:42:07.800
As soon as those two show up...

00:42:08.159 --> 00:42:09.280
...gun them down.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:11.920
Yes.

00:42:13.039 --> 00:42:13.639
Master Geng...

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.880
...I'm taking them now.

00:42:26.239 --> 00:42:27.599
You must succeed.

00:42:28.199 --> 00:42:29.480
Failure is not allowed.
