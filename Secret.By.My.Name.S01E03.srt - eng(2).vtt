00:02:11.085 --> 00:02:12.164
They gave up on you.

00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:13.924
What do you think?

00:02:15.324 --> 00:02:16.325
I do not believe it.

00:02:17.764 --> 00:02:19.364

(Have I really done something wrong?)

00:03:57.164 --> 00:03:59.284
That winter down jacket
supply chain tied to Wang Jinkai,

00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:00.900
we still have not
secured the authorization?

00:04:02.084 --> 00:04:03.285
It is strange.

00:04:03.445 --> 00:04:04.564
For some reason,

00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:07.285
Jianfei is unusually strict
about this segment.

00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:10.483
But for the spring and summer supply chain,
he has loosened up.

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:11.644
The profits are not low either.

00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:12.803
No.

00:04:12.804 --> 00:04:14.644
We have to secure the winter line.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:16.964
Do not forget what you promised me.

00:04:18.644 --> 00:04:19.565
Shujing.

00:04:20.084 --> 00:04:21.165
Do not worry.

What I promised you,

00:04:23.724 --> 00:04:25.484
I will deliver.

00:04:27.445 --> 00:04:28.564
But we still need

00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:29.724
to take this step by step.

00:04:33.284 --> 00:04:34.765
I was too impatient.

00:04:37.724 --> 00:04:39.125
Are you free this afternoon?

00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:41.885
Once this is settled,

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:43.724
let us go see a movie.

00:04:44.964 --> 00:04:45.724
No.

00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:47.484
I have a debt to collect.

00:04:49.644 --> 00:04:51.044
Wang Jinkai

00:04:51.284 --> 00:04:53.644
still has not paid enough interest.

00:05:00.485 --> 00:05:01.885
Are you done packing yet?

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:03.924
It is just a trip abroad.

00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:05.323
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:05:05.324 --> 00:05:06.244
You have no idea.

00:05:06.245 --> 00:05:07.084
Move.

00:05:12.885 --> 00:05:14.365
Do you have everything?

00:05:18.164 --> 00:05:19.365
Why are you here?

00:05:20.045 --> 00:05:22.445
I brought Mrs. Wang to see you off.

00:05:28.084 --> 00:05:29.124
You are shameless.

00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:31.005
So everything she said was true.

00:05:31.204 --> 00:05:33.885
You are really leaving
your family behind for this woman.

00:05:35.844 --> 00:05:37.044
That bag of yours,

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.885
it is full of cash, is it not?

00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:40.924
Mr. Wang, your bank accounts are frozen,

00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:42.844
yet you still managed
to carry this much cash.

00:05:43.844 --> 00:05:45.124
Are you planning to take this lady

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:46.804
and live it up somewhere else?

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.524
Mr. Wang, you really are resourceful.

00:05:50.284 --> 00:05:51.765
Take this woman and leave.

00:05:52.365 --> 00:05:54.325
But the money in the bag stays here.

00:05:54.925 --> 00:05:57.004
- What are you doing?
- I still have a child to raise.

00:05:57.005 --> 00:05:59.084
You. Get out of the way!

00:06:00.964 --> 00:06:01.763
Li Shujing.

00:06:01.764 --> 00:06:03.325
I will kill you.

00:06:28.204 --> 00:06:29.404
Miss,

00:06:29.724 --> 00:06:30.924
are you really sure

00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:32.884
you want to spend your life

00:06:32.885 --> 00:06:34.205
with a bankrupt old man like this?

00:06:34.605 --> 00:06:35.724
I...

00:06:38.964 --> 00:06:39.684
Wang Jinkai,

00:06:39.685 --> 00:06:40.723
listen carefully.

00:06:40.724 --> 00:06:42.163
Consider this money our severance.

00:06:42.164 --> 00:06:43.765
Do not come looking for me again.

00:06:44.084 --> 00:06:44.643
Lan...

00:06:44.644 --> 00:06:45.843
I still have money.

00:06:45.844 --> 00:06:46.203
I...

00:06:46.204 --> 00:06:47.484
I have plenty.

00:06:47.485 --> 00:06:49.325
You still have money for other women?

00:06:49.485 --> 00:06:51.083
That money belongs to me and the child.

00:06:51.084 --> 00:06:52.404
- Mine.
- It is all mine.

00:06:52.605 --> 00:06:54.205
- It is my money.
- Mine.

00:06:54.445 --> 00:06:55.323
Mine.

00:06:55.324 --> 00:06:56.724
- Give it back.
- That is mine.

00:06:59.964 --> 00:07:01.524
Mr. Wang, do not rush.

00:07:01.565 --> 00:07:03.724
The real show has only just begun.

00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:05.765
What you are owed,

00:07:06.084 --> 00:07:08.125
I have not finished paying yet.

00:07:08.404 --> 00:07:10.164
From today onward,

00:07:10.404 --> 00:07:12.445
you are nothing but a stray.

00:07:40.164 --> 00:07:42.005
Ms. Li's technique at taking things

00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:44.284
is far less sharp than it was back then,

00:07:44.324 --> 00:07:45.365
when you undid my belt.

00:07:47.324 --> 00:07:49.284
Young Chairman Tan
really knows how to joke.

00:07:49.605 --> 00:07:50.723
I am only here to retrieve

00:07:50.724 --> 00:07:53.125
the competency assessment materials
Mr. Wang misplaced.

00:07:53.524 --> 00:07:54.925
The Group never said

00:07:55.605 --> 00:07:57.164
that a design director

00:07:57.805 --> 00:07:59.685
was expected to do petty theft.

00:08:00.964 --> 00:08:03.365
Then it seems Young Chairman Tan
should promote me.

00:08:04.005 --> 00:08:05.964
After all, what I cut away for you

00:08:06.245 --> 00:08:08.524
was not just a piece of moldy lining,

00:08:08.925 --> 00:08:11.325
but an entire
supply chain rotten to the core.

00:08:12.005 --> 00:08:12.963
Why not hand me

00:08:12.964 --> 00:08:14.644
the Asia Pacific
fabric procurement rights?

00:08:14.964 --> 00:08:16.925
I guarantee the summer collection

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:19.724
will use only Class A materials
safe even for infants.

00:08:24.485 --> 00:08:25.885
Or we could strike a deal.

00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:27.524
You cancel the engagement

00:08:27.805 --> 00:08:29.164
with Tan Zuoyan,

00:08:29.805 --> 00:08:31.404
and I will give you a diamond mine.

00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:33.200
After all, marrying into the Tan family,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.480
is that not about gaining something
sharp enough to cut deep?

00:08:35.544 --> 00:08:37.444
Young Chairman Tan,
you are seriously undervaluing

00:08:37.445 --> 00:08:39.244
what a strategic marriage is worth.

00:08:39.404 --> 00:08:41.565
The token your brother gave me

00:08:41.804 --> 00:08:43.724
is far sharper than any diamond.

00:08:44.564 --> 00:08:46.004
Besides,

00:08:48.485 --> 00:08:50.525
your brother and I are truly in love.

00:08:56.404 --> 00:08:57.484
What are you doing?

00:08:57.524 --> 00:08:59.084
What are you doing, Tan Jianfei?
