00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.279
(Through the body examination
and scene reconstruction,)

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.359
(we've confirmed the identity
of the deceased.)

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.480
(It was the palace guard,)

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:19.199
(Wu Liang.)

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.280
(And the murderer)

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:23.399
(was Miss Shi Qing
from Consort Hui's palace.)

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.000
(But when I examined
Shi Qing's wounds,)

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.839
(I found she acted in self-defense.)

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.590
(Yet she refused
to prove her innocence.)

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.759
(Besides,)

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.960
(we found that Wu Liang)

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.200
(had been stealing palace property.)

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.679
(Therefore,)

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.759
(it must be something more to this.)

(This story is entirely fictional.)

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.900
=The Imperial Coroner S2=
=Episode 3=

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.520
Today, I'll tell everyone

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.080
the legendary love story of Commandery
Prince An and his Princess Consort.

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:29.840
You didn't help me.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.000
That's because you're blind.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.800
It was obvious His Highness
was planning a surprise for Chu Chu.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.879
You see,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.759
why do all the noble ladies
in the capital

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.199
keep their distance

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.000
from a man like Commandery Prince An,

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.960
yet that Wu Liang

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.400
could charm so many young maids?

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.120
You're with me,

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.639
but you're thinking about another man.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.280
Looking for trouble, aren't you?

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:58.599
Keep making noise,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.850
and you'll be sleeping on the street
with dogs tonight.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.240
Calm down, Madam.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.500
His Highness is busy every day

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.719
and handles important cases
that concern people's lives.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.599
Of course,

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.759
noble ladies don't like him.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.159
Luckily, he has Chu Chu.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.680
The two of them ignore
worldly gossip

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.090
and stick to their true hearts.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.660
They're a perfect match.

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.560
Madam, you have such a keen eye for people,

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:24.879
just like Chu Chu.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.960
That's how you found

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.560
such an excellent husband like me.

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.520
Madam,

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.000
you're in a bad mood today.

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:34.800
Let me guess.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.360
You didn't eat well.

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.290
Since the Prince's manor
doesn't feed us,

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:40.120
Madam,

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.639
take me to eat something good.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.879
In your dream.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.560
Madam,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.319
since we got married,

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.319
I've handed you all my salary.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.800
Please be kind to me, Lady Jing.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.159
Please.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.639
All right.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.439
Watch your manners.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:02.960
Yes, Madam.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.680
Let's go.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.390
Commandery Princess Consort An jumped into
the pool to save her brother.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.080
In a flash,

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.960
Commandery Prince An leaped in after her

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.759
without hesitation.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:13.800
Under the water,

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.360
Commandery Prince An held
tightly onto her hand,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.279
afraid she might be hurt.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:24.680
(Virtue Known Across the Four Seas)

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.079
So?

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:27.360
Still don't know what you did wrong?

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:31.000
I'll give you a hint.

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:32.519
Where were you on this day

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:33.519
three years ago?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.040
Three years ago...

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.560
Was it something important?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.480
Was it our first case?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.880
Or the day we first met?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.000
No.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.160
I had just arrived in the capital then.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.000
Come.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.680
A coroner's duty

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.399
is to record what is seen,

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.000
smelled, and touched.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.279
Reasoning and making decisions
are beyond a coroner.

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.079
Without full certainty,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.399
we must not speak carelessly.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.839
Are you

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:40.160
the living corpse?

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.560
Why are you only here now?

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:42.879
I've been waiting for you.

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:55.079
You're the test.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.000
Whether I examine you or not
isn't up to you.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.199
If you won't take it off, I'll help you.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.160
Three years ago today

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.759
was the day we first met.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.560
Come.

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:20.120
Who's there?

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:21.279
Mr. Chu?

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:23.680
Keep it down.

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:24.680
Keep it down.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.740
Mr. Chu, what are you doing out here
in the middle of the night,

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.879
sneaking around like a thief?

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.880
I'm checking on my sister.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.560
His Highness is full of schemes.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.890
I'm afraid she might get wronged.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.879
They're now

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.360
husband and wife.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.360
She's a Princess Consort.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.300
What grievance
could she possibly suffer?

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.160
That's hard to say.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.120
I know

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.839
how men are.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.000
I heard Qianzhou men can drink.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.000
I don't believe it.

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.600
Come on.

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:53.000
We'll see who wins tonight.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.879
Are you a real man?

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.199
Come.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.550
Let's drink till one of us drops.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.160
I can't drink.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:56.800
Come on.

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:04.839
This is

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.680
our wedding day.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.199
You drew this?

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:10.160
Yes.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.800
I worked on it for a long time.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.399
But it doesn't look

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.000
as good as you did that day.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.319
No.

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:19.319
This one is prettier.

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:25.800
Chu Chu.

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:28.639
I'm sorry.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.600
At our wedding,

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:32.759
I should've welcomed you

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.190
with grand bridal processions.

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:37.160
But instead, it turned into a trap
to capture the rebels.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.900
You even had to pretend
to be His Majesty

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:40.439
and almost got hurt.

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:42.480
I don't regret it at all.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.040
To help my husband wipe out the traitors
on our wedding day,

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.120
that's a heroine

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.720
not even a huaben can write.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.360
Your Highness,

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:53.720
now that I've married you,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.199
I don't just want to receive

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.600
all the love you give me,

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.790
I also want to stand beside you
and face the world together.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.120
Thank you.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.680
Why are you so good-looking?

00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:14.800
You're flattering me
with that line again.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.439
I forgot what day it is today,

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:20.680
so I didn't prepare a gift for you.

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:26.040
Think of something else

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:27.279
to please me.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.080
"Green, green the reed,

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:35.360
dew and frost gleam.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.960
Where's he I need?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.840
Beyond the stream."

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.200
"Duckweed rests on the clear water,

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.320
drifting east and west in the wind.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.700
I bind my hair and leave my parents
to become another man's wife."

00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:51.559
Since when did you start liking
Cao Zhi's poems?

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:53.320
Seems I haven't worked hard enough

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:54.600
to pull my wife

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.240
out from under the duckweed.

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:00.480
I read it from somewhere else.

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:01.810
But looks like I used it wrongly.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.990
I saw those lines in the palace maids'
letters earlier today and memorized them.

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:06.120
Oh right.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.639
There's one last line.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.360
"Rescued me from beneath the duckweed."

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:12.039
I don't quite get what it means.

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:14.480
People say the Three Judicial Offices

00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:16.519
come first in my heart.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.880
But I think my wife
values them even more.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.200
I don't know

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.519
which case I come second to.

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:22.879
You come first.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:24.559
Pardon?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.159
Why is that?

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:30.360
Why what?

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.240
Why did you kiss me?

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:32.540
Why would I need a reason?

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:33.440
I just wanted to.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.240
You scared me.

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:12.240
Your Highness,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.879
why are you here
so early in the morning?

00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:20.919
Did last night's surprise
turn into a shock,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.480
and you got kicked out of your room?

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:27.360
Spare us a way to live, please.

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:28.440
You work so hard.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.860
How are the rest of us
supposed to survive?

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.159
Then you should work harder.

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:32.559
The rooster hasn't crowed yet.

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:33.890
What are you doing here?

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.759
Didn't you tell me last night

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:38.240
to patrol every street

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:39.360
and write a detailed report,

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.240
and hand it to you personally
this morning?

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.620
All right. Go on with your work.
I'm leaving.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.519
Wait.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.120
Nothing urgent.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.890
You can focus on
the important cases first.

00:10:54.919 --> 00:10:56.200
You can read them slowly

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.639
when you're free and in a good mood.

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:05.159
You can run, but you can't hide.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.440
It's windy outside.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:09.660
I was worried you'd catch a chill.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.879
A night after the drink.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.080
City Office main gate,

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.840
left diagonal,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.080
third alley, turn right.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.519
Scholar tree cold noodles.

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:27.960
Signature soup base is a secret recipe.

00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:31.480
- Broth fat can be brewed into tea.
- Have a nice day.

00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:33.440
You're not paying?

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:33.960
It's fine.

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:36.200
It's fine.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.330
Please go on with your food.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.480
Don't you know who I am?

00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:47.279
Uh...

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:53.000
Take care, officers.

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:06.799
Yao Family Preserved Fruit.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.120
Eleventh shop west of Cao Gate.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.000
Litchis are the top pick.
Perfectly soft and sweet.

00:12:12.039 --> 00:12:12.799
They taste

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.639
like the legendary love story of Commandery
Prince An and his Princess Consort.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.679
How is it?

00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:19.919
Doesn't that sound tempting?

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.190
Makes you want to try it, right?

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.519
You sneaked in here like a thief
this early

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.519
just to drop these in

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.720
and call it done?

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.399
This is about people's livelihood.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.679
That's important.

00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:39.000
Hurry up.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.480
I do have important news.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:48.919
Speak.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Your brother-in-law

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.039
was checking up on you.

00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:53.480
Chu He?

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.679
Wu Jiang got him

00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:58.399
completely drunk last night.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.950
He was wandering and asking everyone,

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.320
"Does Commandery Prince An treat
the Princess Consort well?

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.000
Does he have a mistress?

00:13:04.039 --> 00:13:05.679
Is there trouble
with the mother-in-law?"

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.879
And that huaben
about your legendary love story,

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:10.279
your brother-in-law

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.240
bought a copy.

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:11.919
Oh right,

00:13:12.039 --> 00:13:12.919
Wu Jiang paid for it.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.080
Remember

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:14.840
to pay him back.

00:13:21.799 --> 00:13:22.399
Let's work.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.360
Have you seen him?

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:40.919
No.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.540
What about you?

00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:43.279
- No.
- No.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.879
There are thousands of palace guards.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.519
How would the maids know them well?

00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:57.000
Take a look.

00:14:01.159 --> 00:14:02.720
Do you know whose these are?

00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:05.320
No.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:06.250
I don't recognize them.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.180
(Register of Palace Maids,
Imperial Chambers and Banquets Bureau)

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.460
(The peace tree beams so red.
How brilliant are its flowers!)

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:39.720
Chu Chu.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.200
Here you go.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:45.919
Look at these.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.639
Read this.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.340
(To my dear Wu Liang.
Beloved Wu Liang.)

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.740
(Personnel records)

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.720
Your Highness,

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.279
we have duties to attend to.

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:39.120
Your Highness,

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.600
I honestly don't know anything.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:42.919
This is a Three Judicial Offices case.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.080
Answer whatever Her Highness asks.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.840
Do you know Wu Liang?

00:15:48.679 --> 00:15:50.159
- No.
- No.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.879
Then you recognize these letters,
don't you?

00:15:57.879 --> 00:15:59.559
I checked the handwriting.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.020
I called you all here

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.700
because I don't want to
make it a scandal.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.600
Do not lie to me.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.519
Your Highness,

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:07.840
we're begging you.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.720
These letters

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.720
were written by us.

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:13.639
But only because we thought
Wu Liang was kind,

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.519
upright, and chivalrous.

00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:16.519
Your Highness,

00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:17.799
please go easy on us.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.399
Please show mercy.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.960
You didn't know the others
were also writing to him, right?

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:30.639
No.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.080
You're wise, Your Highness.

00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:34.240
Did you know Wu Liang was stealing?

00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:37.000
- No.
- No.

00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:41.600
Did Shi Qing have any grudge

00:16:41.799 --> 00:16:42.679
against him?

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.039
No idea.

00:16:45.799 --> 00:16:46.799
Miss Shi Qing

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.399
may be strict,

00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:50.159
but she has a soft heart.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.240
She would never kill without cause.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.639
Please spare her, Your Highness.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.660
- Please spare her, Your Highness.
- Please spare her, Your Highness.

00:16:57.799 --> 00:16:58.600
Get up and talk.

00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:03.519
I want to help her too.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.470
But the imperial decree has been issued.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.960
Unless there is more to this case,

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:07.720
otherwise,

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.240
none of us can change it.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:13.170
Since you refuse to speak,

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:14.279
Leng Yue,

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.079
let's go.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:18.319
Your Highness!

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.119
Could you keep the letters

00:17:24.519 --> 00:17:26.160
a secret?

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:31.319
Your Highness,

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:33.240
if this gets out,

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:34.960
we'll face palace punishment,

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.400
or even death.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.319
Many maids in the palace respect you.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.279
We all wish we could be like you

00:17:41.799 --> 00:17:43.200
to make our own way in this world.

00:17:43.519 --> 00:17:44.680
But fate won't allow it.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.200
We don't have the power to.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:47.960
In this country,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.559
you're the only female coroner.

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:50.690
Your Highness,

00:17:51.599 --> 00:17:53.000
will you show mercy

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.640
and spare us?

00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:55.400
Your Highness,

00:17:55.839 --> 00:17:57.200
we know we were wrong.

00:17:57.559 --> 00:17:58.759
Please.

00:17:59.599 --> 00:18:00.960
- Please.
- Please.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.000
Get up.

00:18:11.319 --> 00:18:12.039
Wu Liang is dead,

00:18:12.519 --> 00:18:13.640
and Shi Qing has confessed.

00:18:14.839 --> 00:18:15.720
But will there

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.759
never be another Wu Liang
in this palace?

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.279
Your Highness,

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.839
we checked everything

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.650
taken from Wu Liang
against palace records.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.599
Fearing they would draw attention,

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.880
he probably hid them first.

00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:50.960
All the valuable
ornamental vessels and jewelry are present

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.440
and accounted for.

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.079
But one type is short by several pieces.

00:18:56.039 --> 00:18:56.720
What is it?

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:10.640
You're on night patrol tonight.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.460
Several calligraphy
and paintings are missing.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:14.990
Calligraphy and paintings?

00:19:15.119 --> 00:19:15.440
Yes.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.960
Consort Hui enjoys
His Majesty's favor.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.400
His Majesty has given her many works.

00:19:21.519 --> 00:19:22.200
And several

00:19:23.359 --> 00:19:24.480
calligraphy and paintings

00:19:24.599 --> 00:19:25.039
are gone.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.390
They're not among the stolen goods.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.440
Did he sell them?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.480
We couldn't trace a sale.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.160
I don't think he dared to.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.990
Selling imperial gifts is punishable
by the extermination of an entire clan.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.680
Someone greedy and lustful like him
is timid.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.559
Besides, even if he dared to sell them,
who would buy them?

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.119
Calligraphy and paintings...

00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:47.000
The palace runs on
too many unwritten rules

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.960
outside the law.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.839
You did your best.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.799
Now I understand what you meant.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.640
Law is law.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.279
Palace rules are palace rules.

00:19:59.519 --> 00:20:00.559
Get back to your work!

00:20:03.079 --> 00:20:03.599
Stop.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.240
Get up.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.440
This young eunuch
looks pale and is sweating.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.480
His hands are shaking.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.880
He must be exhausted from hunger.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.690
Give him something to eat
before he works.

00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:18.880
(Li Fuping, Eunuch)
Yes, Your Highness.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:20.920
Go.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.880
I, Fuping, see Your Highness

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.079
and Lady Jing off.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.880
"That day you saved me
from the duckweeds."

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.200
Get lost.

00:20:33.279 --> 00:20:33.960
Duckweed?

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.880
What did you say

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.880
your name was?

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.319
My name is Li Fuping.
[*Duckweed is pronounced as "fu ping" in Chinese]

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:48.079
Do you know Liu'er?

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.000
I do.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.440
I tend the imperial garden.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.720
I recognize all the cleaning maids there,

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:57.640
though

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.279
I don't know them well.

00:20:59.559 --> 00:21:00.200
You're lying.

00:21:02.359 --> 00:21:03.839
Just so you know,

00:21:04.319 --> 00:21:06.240
when people lie or feel nervous,

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.920
their face stiffens,

00:21:08.039 --> 00:21:10.039
they force a smile,

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.440
and their eyes avoid contact.

00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:12.519
Just like you now.

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:13.359
Speak out.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.810
What's your relationship with Liu'er?

00:21:18.079 --> 00:21:20.119
I saw her

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.440
being bullied all the time,

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.000
so I tried to

00:21:24.319 --> 00:21:25.839
look out for her.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.279
But Liu'er

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.319
misunderstood me.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.359
She had a guard named Wu Liang

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.920
beat me.

00:21:33.519 --> 00:21:34.279
After that,

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:35.359
we had nothing to do

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.640
with each other.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.039
Who would have thought

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.559
she could act so virtuously,

00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:42.119
yet end up

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.559
pregnant,

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.480
and even have a miscarriage?

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:56.200
Look at these, Your Highness.

00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:58.559
Why would a grown man like Wu Liang

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.079
have so many sachets at his place?

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.440
Let me see.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.200
Could these

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.759
be the tokens he exchanged

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.079
with the palace maids he met in secret?

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.160
No wonder

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.839
when Leng Yue and I
were questioning the maids,

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.400
Liu'er acted so strangely.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.519
I thought she was afraid of me.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.079
But what she feared
was this being exposed.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:28.960
Ordinary sachets don't have
a strong smell like this.

00:22:30.839 --> 00:22:32.279
What's inside?

00:22:35.359 --> 00:22:36.720
Pine needles,

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.200
lilies,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.319
and musk.

00:22:40.599 --> 00:22:41.599
Liu'er miscarriage...

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:43.880
Muske isn't as potent
as the rumors claim.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.319
A small amount
isn't enough to cause a miscarriage.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.799
There's also

00:22:54.319 --> 00:22:55.279
cinnabar.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.839
But when combined with cinnabar,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.759
it becomes a powerful drug
causing marriage.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.990
It can easily make a woman barren.

00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:07.240
I'm Wu Liang.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.720
You beast!

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:10.520
You still won't leave me alone
even in death.

00:24:11.319 --> 00:24:12.079
Help me!

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.720
I don't even want to live anymore!

00:24:14.079 --> 00:24:15.119
Help!

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.279
Help!

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.640
You all lied to me.

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:32.759
You all lied to me!

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.640
Still refusing to speak?

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.180
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:38.039
Liu'er,

00:24:38.319 --> 00:24:39.920
why won't you tell the truth?

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.240
Do you really want to
watch Shi Qing die?

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.319
You don't have to say it now.

00:24:48.519 --> 00:24:50.519
The evidence has put
the truth together.

00:24:51.519 --> 00:24:53.000
When a eunuch harassed you,

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.440
Wu Liang happened to save you.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.400
Shall we talk somewhere else?

00:25:08.319 --> 00:25:09.640
Maybe you can put me down first.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:17.990
Hang there a while longer.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.240
Alright, Madam.

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:21.960
It's quite breezy up here.

00:25:29.559 --> 00:25:31.599
We checked the letters
you wrote to Wu Liang.

00:25:32.759 --> 00:25:33.599
We matched them

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.119
with what Eunuch Li said,

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.200
and we can roughly tell

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.039
how you and Wu Liang met.

00:25:40.119 --> 00:25:41.720
Even if you leave the palace one day,

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.680
you've already passed
the age for marriage.

00:25:43.839 --> 00:25:45.039
You might as well stay here

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.240
and let me look after you.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.400
Old geezer,

00:25:51.559 --> 00:25:53.200
if you ever touch a girl again,

00:25:53.519 --> 00:25:56.319
I'll cut off your legs
and hand you to the palace official.

00:25:56.839 --> 00:25:57.260
Get lost.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:06.960
Miss.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:09.599
Miss, don't be afraid.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.480
If he dares to bully you again,
come to me.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.440
As long as I'm here, you're safe.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.400
From then on,

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.279
the two of you fell for each other.

00:26:22.279 --> 00:26:24.279
Wu Liang swore his love to you.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.800
When you leave the palace,

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.759
I'll marry you in grand style.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.599
I will love only you for life.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.680
You met in secret from time to time.

00:26:36.359 --> 00:26:37.319
You never expected

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.480
to get pregnant.

00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:42.119
You were afraid someone would find out,

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.559
so you went to Wu Liang

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.120
and had him secretly prepare
an abortion formula.

00:26:53.119 --> 00:26:54.359
Your Highness, don't slander me.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.640
No woman would want to kill her baby

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.279
when carrying her first child.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.680
You finally spoke.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.400
If you didn't wish to
abort the child yourself,

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.599
then this is what happened.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:06.720
I shall take my leave.

00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:12.599
After learning of your pregnancy,

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.279
you hurried to tell Wu Liang.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.839
You're going to be a father.

00:27:19.079 --> 00:27:19.799
Really?

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.640
I never thought it would happen so soon.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.790
Tomorrow I'll have
someone pull some strings.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.160
No matter how much silver it takes,

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.079
I'll get you released
from the palace early.

00:27:28.359 --> 00:27:28.680
Mm.

00:27:28.839 --> 00:27:31.319
You must be extra careful these days.

00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:33.920
Wu Liang soothed you

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:35.599
and gave you sachets.

00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:38.000
He gave you many of them

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.440
so you would wear them often.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.640
But you didn't know

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.480
that wearing them for a long time

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.400
would make a woman barren.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.720
We'll leave the palace

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:49.960
and live together.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:50.599
All right.

00:27:51.279 --> 00:27:52.759
But what you didn't know

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.720
was that Wu Liang had
more than one woman.

00:27:58.279 --> 00:28:00.119
Secrets can't be kept forever.

00:28:00.359 --> 00:28:03.720
You hated him because you caught him
fooling around with others, didn't you?

00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:05.240
You!

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.120
Do you have any conscience at all,
Wu Liang?

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.480
I'm carrying your child,

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:11.759
and you're flirting with her.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.680
Why speak so harshly?

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.640
Didn't you and I get together
the same way?

00:28:18.519 --> 00:28:20.240
If you want people to know
you're pregnant,

00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:21.400
go ahead and shout.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.720
The one who loses her head won't be me.

00:28:26.839 --> 00:28:27.359
Let's go.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.039
How can you do this to me?

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.759
That betrayal

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.000
made you see Wu Liang's true colors.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.160
I didn't expect

00:28:42.079 --> 00:28:43.599
Your Highness to lay it out

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.160
so exactly.

00:28:46.039 --> 00:28:47.720
I have nothing left to deny.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.599
He deceived me with more than
just the sachets.

00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:53.519
To hush me,

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.440
he tricked me into stealing for me.

00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:58.720
We do have some past between us.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.590
How about this?

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.290
Steal the calligraphy and paintings
from Consort Hui's palace again.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.640
You beast!

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.680
I'll report you to the palace official
right now.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.480
We all go down together.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.799
I won't let you get away with it.

00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:16.799
Secretly meeting a guard
and stealing palace property.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.570
Do you know that can
bring death to the entire clan?

00:29:18.839 --> 00:29:19.880
If you don't care about

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.279
your seventy-year-old grandfather

00:29:21.319 --> 00:29:23.480
and your little sister,
who is still a child,

00:29:24.039 --> 00:29:26.079
I don't mind going down with you.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.480
Bring the thing as soon as possible.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.599
Otherwise...

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.720
So

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.400
Shi Qing caught
you and Wu Liang stealing,

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.390
and Wu Liang tried to kill her,
which forced her to fight back?

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:41.880
No.

00:29:42.279 --> 00:29:43.559
Miss Shi Qing is a good person.

00:29:44.119 --> 00:29:46.039
The one who deserves to die is me.

00:29:47.599 --> 00:29:49.079
Why did she help you,

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.319
even to the point
of killing him by mistake?

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.319
Later,

00:29:57.359 --> 00:29:59.200
I realized I had fallen into
Wu Liang's trap.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.240
If this were exposed,

00:30:03.839 --> 00:30:06.279
not only would I be severely punished,

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.100
but my whole family would also
be dragged into it.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.720
I had to make a choice.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.720
What do you think you're doing?

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:33.190
Jumping into a well
in the middle of the night?

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.480
He lied to me.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.839
I'm so hopeless!

00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:44.920
What happened?

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.039
After Miss Shi Qing looked into it,

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.680
she found out Wu Liang
had been deceiving many people.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.559
Many palace maids were harmed by him.

00:30:57.119 --> 00:31:00.440
Miss Shi Qing couldn't stand it
and said she would seek justice for us,

00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:02.799
make that scoundrel pay.

00:31:03.839 --> 00:31:04.799
Unexpectedly,

00:31:05.319 --> 00:31:06.559
she killed him by mistake.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.400
It's all my fault
for trusting the wrong man.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.400
I ruined myself
and dragged Miss Shi Qing into this.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.079
From the day
you started investigating this case,

00:31:16.359 --> 00:31:17.759
I've been in torment.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.480
I wanted to come forward
and tell the truth

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:20.960
to clear Miss Shi Qing's name.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.480
But if I did that,
all the maids Wu Liang deceived

00:31:25.039 --> 00:31:26.759
would be driven out of the palace

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.759
and carry this shame
for the rest of their lives.

00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:31.720
What should I do?

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.400
What should I do?

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.599
Stop pushing me.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.880
Stop pushing me. I beg you.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.480
I beg you!

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.680
Well.

00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:47.640
Let go of me!

00:31:47.759 --> 00:31:48.519
Let her be for now.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.319
If only Wu Liang

00:31:58.039 --> 00:31:59.319
had been killed by me.

00:32:10.279 --> 00:32:11.279
Let go of me.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.240
Don't worry.

00:32:13.759 --> 00:32:14.680
Leave it to Chu Chu.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.160
There.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.440
Miss Shi Qing, it's time to eat.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.039
Thank you, Eunuch.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.039
When will the execution be tomorrow?

00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:51.359
At dusk.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:55.680
Miss Shi Qing,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.920
Commandery Princess Consort An
wants to see you.

00:33:06.319 --> 00:33:08.079
I served Consort Hui

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.440
for many years.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.559
I learned a lot from her.

00:33:12.319 --> 00:33:14.480
Once, she hosted a noble guest

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.519
and served a fish.

00:33:17.559 --> 00:33:18.559
That guest

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.839
picked the fish belly
with their first bite.

00:33:22.359 --> 00:33:24.440
Her Grace smiled and said

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.880
you could tell the guest
wasn't from a wealthy family.

00:33:28.599 --> 00:33:30.000
Do you know why?

00:33:32.599 --> 00:33:33.920
My brother always gives me

00:33:34.119 --> 00:33:35.960
the fish belly.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.880
How did Consort Hui judge the guest?

00:33:42.279 --> 00:33:43.400
The best part

00:33:43.599 --> 00:33:44.920
of a fish

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.480
is the meat behind the gills

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.000
near the fin.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:49.700
It's called the crescent-shaped meat.

00:33:51.079 --> 00:33:52.680
Children from noble families

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.480
only eat that part.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.870
Anyone who goes straight
for the big pieces

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.799
rarely eats fish.

00:34:01.759 --> 00:34:02.559
Today...

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.119
Today I want to be a noble person once.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.199
You shouldn't die. You deserve to live.

00:34:12.559 --> 00:34:13.679
Liu'er told us everything.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.039
You did all this

00:34:15.079 --> 00:34:16.320
for her and the other maids.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.960
As expected of you, Your Highness.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.800
You found out.

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:23.599
If you tell the truth, you may live.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.820
What about Liu'er and the rest?

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:29.760
You and Commandery Prince An

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.159
both uphold the laws of the Tang

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.400
with integrity.

00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:33.599
But in this world,

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.320
there are people

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:36.719
and matters

00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:39.440
that the law can't always judge fairly.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.960
If they're accused of improper conduct,

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:43.519
even in death, people would still

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.910
point their fingers
at Liu'er and the other maids.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.880
Wu Liang used that against them.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:48.559
That's why even after he was exposed,

00:34:48.599 --> 00:34:50.880
he still dared to threaten them.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:54.280
There must be another way.

00:34:58.519 --> 00:35:00.119
If you were me,

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.039
what would you do?

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.840
I'm no saint.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.000
I'm just a palace servant like them.

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:16.760
Since I can't clear

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.159
my charge of murder,

00:35:18.559 --> 00:35:19.960
at least I can protect as many

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.079
of these poor girls

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.719
as I can.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:49.639
Your Highness.

00:35:52.559 --> 00:35:53.159
What's wrong?

00:35:54.239 --> 00:35:55.000
She won't speak?

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:56.800
Mm.

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:04.119
Then the Three Judicial Offices
will step in and reveal the truth

00:36:05.679 --> 00:36:06.960
to clear Shi Qing's name.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.440
No.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.639
Shi Qing is innocent.

00:36:11.039 --> 00:36:12.199
If we know the truth

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.719
yet let the case be wrongly closed,

00:36:14.119 --> 00:36:15.760
we betray the law of the Tang.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.519
What about Liu'er and the others?

00:36:18.719 --> 00:36:20.440
They were lured and threatened

00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:21.880
by Wu Liang.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.599
By palace rules,
at most they'll be expelled.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.320
Everyone must bear the cost
of their choices.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.400
Your Highness,

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.119
I've been thinking these days.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.360
Why do we

00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:35.280
really investigate cases?

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:36.800
What do you mean?

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.840
Being a woman is hard.

00:36:40.199 --> 00:36:42.480
I'm one of the luckiest.

00:36:43.199 --> 00:36:44.760
I have a career I love

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:46.960
and someone as good as you.

00:36:47.639 --> 00:36:48.679
Even so,

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.159
I still suffer criticism

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.280
for being a female coroner
and a princess consort.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.559
What about all the other women?

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.239
How much harder are their lives?

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.199
The fairness of the law

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.920
is like a beam of light

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.320
in this dark prison.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.280
It is precious.

00:37:05.079 --> 00:37:06.800
But must it also expose

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:08.990
the wounds of the innocent
to be mocked by the world?

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.119
Women in the palace are pitiful.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.840
What Shi Qing risks her life to protect
is not their reputation,

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.000
but their hope to survive.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.559
But letting Shi Qing

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.719
die unjustly

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.519
is not fair to her.

00:37:27.039 --> 00:37:27.639
Your Highness,

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.239
can we wait a little longer?

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.559
Maybe

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.480
a better ending will come.

00:37:36.679 --> 00:37:37.119
Mm.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.559
I trust you.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.039
The time has come.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.079
Shi Qing,

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.800
for murdering a palace guard,

00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:04.199
should be beaten to death

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.880
by palace law.

00:38:06.039 --> 00:38:08.360
But for her years

00:38:08.599 --> 00:38:09.920
of loyal service,

00:38:10.119 --> 00:38:12.440
she is granted poisoned liquor instead.

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:35.159
Hold on.

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:39.100
For this case...

00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:39.840
Your Highness!

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.639
I beg Your Highness
to spare the innocent.

00:38:50.639 --> 00:38:51.280
Wait.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:55.920
Liu'er?

00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.360
How dare you!

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.100
Do you have a death wish?

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:02.360
Sir,

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.679
Miss Shi Qing is innocent.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.639
Do you have proof?

00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:07.719
Liu'er.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.719
What I hold in my hands is proof.

00:39:15.639 --> 00:39:16.920
I beg you to reopen this case

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.639
and clear Miss Shi Qing's name.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.239
Sir.

00:39:22.559 --> 00:39:22.840
No.

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:23.430
- That's not it.
- That's not it.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.159
- Sir.
- Sir.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.800
We are the proof.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.559
Please reopen the case

00:39:29.159 --> 00:39:30.480
and clear Miss Shi Qing's name.

00:39:31.199 --> 00:39:33.260
- Please clear Miss Shi Qing's name.
- Please clear Miss Shi Qing's name.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:34.719
You...

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.039
Sir, since there is injustice,

00:39:41.239 --> 00:39:45.039
the Palace Domestic Service should
retry the case and clear the innocent.

00:39:45.679 --> 00:39:45.960
This...

00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:48.160
Your Highness,
how should we deal with this?

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:10.140

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.660
