00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.920
Mom

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:54.319
You haven't been sleeping well these past few days either.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.879
Go inside and rest for a bit.

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:01.319
I'm fine, don't worry.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.079
Your dad's illness...

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.840
I've been mentally prepared for it for a long time.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.240
These past few days,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.560
you've all worked so hard.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.759
Running around, busy with everything.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.039
Busy with your dad's funeral arrangements.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.479
Now it's finally all done.

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.479
You should all go back and get some rest.

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.039
It's okay, we'll keep you company.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.039
Xiaoshi,

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.080
take Qiu'er back home.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.120
Take him out to get some fresh air.

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.960
You all should go.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.520
Go on.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.240
Go back home.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.120
I also need

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.280
some peace and quiet.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.639
Later, let's bring Mom over to live with us.

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.120
It'll be easier to take care of her.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.960
My mom definitely can't bear to leave my dad.

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.199
When we get home, you go up first.

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.879
I'm not comfortable leaving her alone either.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.040
Stay with her for a few days.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.839
Okay.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.839
If anything comes up with Mom, let me know anytime.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.439
Rather than saying we, father and son, got this illness,

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.439
it's more like fate

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.120
gave us a chance to be reborn again.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.120
Uncle Tong is seventy this year, right?

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:10.240
Sixty-nine.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.000
Uncle Tong, let me ask you.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.199
How many complete screenplays can you still write?

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.680
Weiguo, let's not talk about this, let's eat.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.079
But if this story

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.199
is the last screenplay you ever write,

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:24.759
would you be content with that?

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.160
Sometimes when your vision is elevated,

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.920
you can look down.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.720
But if you're standing at the base of a building,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.160
you don't necessarily have to know

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.199
what the top looks like, right?

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.959
You think you're all prepared,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.560
kid.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.839
You're not at that stage yet.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.199
Death

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.160
is truly terrifying.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:16.600
It's better to be alive.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.319
Isn't that right?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.319
These two sentences

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:22.600
are our mutual encouragement, father and son.

00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:05.439
Son,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.639
do you remember

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:12.360
that scar on your dad's head?

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:15.040
He said he got it in a fight, right?

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:20.639
He lied to you.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.759
Actually,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.319
when he was little,

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:28.279
your grandpa kicked him.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.399
At that time,

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.759
your dad's head

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:36.000
hit the corner of a table.

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:39.759
It made a big gash.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.120
The blood was gushing out.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.039
So when you were little,

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:50.159
no matter how much you acted up,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.840
he never once hit you.

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:00.399
At most, he'd yell at you a couple times.

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:03.000
He said

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:06.440
he absolutely could not be like your grandpa,

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:10.879
taking his anger out on the child at the drop of a hat.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.840
But there was just one time,

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:18.519
just one time.

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:21.519
That year,

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:24.159
he won a

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.639
screenplay award.

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:34.399
After he got the trophy,

00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:37.279
he was overjoyed.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.639
Even when sleeping,

00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:42.279
he would place it

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:44.960
between the two of us.

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:48.240
Then,

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:51.919
it turned out

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:54.919
you broke it.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.720
He was really angry.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.000
He raised his hand to hit you.

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:06.679
But in the end, he didn't strike.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.000
He told me later,

00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:14.519
"What's wrong with me?

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:18.360
Just because of a trophy,

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:22.240
I thought about hitting my child."

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.360
From then on,

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:28.360
he put that trophy away.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.960
He never took it out again.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.799
From now on, your symptoms

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.639
will definitely become more and more obvious.

00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:53.519
Why did you wait until now to come?

00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:59.200
You've already missed the optimal time for surgery.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:01.039
Having surgery now

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.919
carries too high a risk.

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:05.200
By the way,

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.480
where is your family?

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.600
Do you remember what Mom said?

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.360
I remember.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.519
Dad.

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:40.440
Yuanyuan!

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.039
I missed you so much!

00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:46.279
Jenny has had a bit of an upset stomach these past couple days.

00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:47.679
Don't let her eat random stuff.

00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:49.039
I put her homework in her bag.

00:13:49.039 --> 00:13:50.039
Remember to have her finish it.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.200
The piano lesson is at two this afternoon.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.879
It's really hard to park at Teacher Li's place.

00:13:53.879 --> 00:13:54.759
Head over there early.

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:56.039
Don't make her late for class.

00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:59.039
Alright, do you really need to teach me these things?

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.200
Yuanyuan, let's go.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.759
Bye, Mom!

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.200
And Uncle Kevin too!

00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:05.360
Bye-bye!

00:14:09.039 --> 00:14:09.720
Get in the car.

00:14:29.879 --> 00:14:31.000
Who is it?

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.960
You look a bit worn out.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.559
It's nothing.

00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:47.960
I want to take two picture frames to the shop to try them out.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.519
This early?

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:51.480
Later, the shop will be crowded.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.559
Then I'll get ready and go with you.

00:14:54.559 --> 00:14:55.480
It's fine, take your time.

00:14:55.559 --> 00:14:56.720
Darn it, I'll go get them now.

00:15:14.759 --> 00:15:15.960
I've been thinking,

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.919
it's better to sell the apartment on the Third Ring Road first.

00:15:18.519 --> 00:15:19.759
The one on the Fifth Ring is too big.

00:15:19.759 --> 00:15:20.679
It won't sell easily.

00:15:21.559 --> 00:15:24.039
Brother Liu, keep an eye on this matter.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.080
If you have any news, just tell me.

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:29.279
Alright, alright, no problem.

00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:31.960
Dad.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:32.840
What's up?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.840
I need to use the bathroom.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.360
Then wait a moment.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.399
Let me find a restroom.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.679
Brother Liu, don't hang up yet.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.320
Yuanyuan, come here.

00:15:59.039 --> 00:15:59.759
Take it easy.

00:16:00.039 --> 00:16:01.000
You're going by yourself?

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.200
Brother Liu, go on, please.

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:09.960
This matter can be discussed.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.679
Right now, I have...

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:13.840
...some stocks and investments.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.679
There's no other way.

00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:16.679
So we'll just have to take the loss.

00:16:16.679 --> 00:16:17.879
We'll earn it back later.

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:22.600
If he asks, you tell him.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.039
If he doesn't ask, don't mention it.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:24.960
Yuanyuan, hurry.

00:16:26.679 --> 00:16:27.679
Close the door yourself.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.440
I'm fine.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.279
Dad, wait for me.

00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:34.120
I'll get you a bottle of water.

00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:41.919
Dad! Dad!

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:49.279
I think this matter can be discussed.

00:16:50.519 --> 00:16:51.840
Alright, Brother Liu.

00:16:52.039 --> 00:16:53.639
We should really talk in person.

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:55.679
Let me take Yuanyuan home first.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.159
Yuanyuan, something just came up for Dad.

00:16:59.159 --> 00:17:00.559
I need to take you home first.

00:17:02.039 --> 00:17:02.919
Yuanyuan?

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.279
Yuanyuan!

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:26.119
How's it going?

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.960
Watch your hands.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.720
It's fine.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.880
What's wrong with you?

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.519
You seem a bit off.

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:38.839
It's nothing.

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:40.279
I want to help you finish this quickly.

00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:41.279
There's still a lot left.

00:17:41.839 --> 00:17:43.920
No rush, we can take our time.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.599
What do you mean no rush?

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.119
If I don't help you finish in time,

00:17:47.119 --> 00:17:48.519
you'll say I went back on my word again.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.839
How could I?

00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:53.599
Are you tired?

00:17:53.599 --> 00:17:54.400
Take a break, I'll handle it.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.839
No need, you go do your thing.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.519
No, I think it's kind of fun.

00:17:57.519 --> 00:17:58.599
I want to give it a try too.

00:17:58.599 --> 00:17:59.119
Here, let me do it.

00:17:59.119 --> 00:17:59.920
Are you hungry?

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:01.400
Do you want to go eat?

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.440
I'm not hungry.

00:18:03.279 --> 00:18:04.519
You rest, I'll take over.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:08.720
Then I'll go buy you something to eat.

00:18:38.839 --> 00:18:39.640
Yuanyuan?

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.839
Dad?

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.799
Yuanyuan!

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.880
Where did you go?

00:18:45.079 --> 00:18:46.079
Didn't I tell you...

00:18:46.079 --> 00:18:47.559
...not to run off?

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.480
I'm sorry, Dad.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.319
I wanted to find you a bottle of water in the back.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.640
I'm sorry.

00:18:57.319 --> 00:18:58.440
It's Dad's fault.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.720
It's Dad's fault.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.920
Dad...

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.880
I know you're busy with work.

00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:06.279
But I knew you'd come back for me.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.200
So I waited right here for you.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.599
I'm sorry.

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:18.839
It's Dad's fault.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.079
I shouldn't have left you behind.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.960
Dad...

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:27.599
I'm sorry.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.240
Auntie Tong, are you home?

00:19:33.279 --> 00:19:34.039
Coming!

00:19:34.759 --> 00:19:35.519
Oh, Chunsheng.

00:19:35.519 --> 00:19:36.000
Auntie.

00:19:36.119 --> 00:19:37.640
I made you some dinner.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.039
Eat it while it's hot.

00:19:39.319 --> 00:19:40.559
These are groceries I bought for you.

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:41.799
I'll put them in the fridge.

00:19:42.519 --> 00:19:43.119
Later on,

00:19:43.119 --> 00:19:45.559
if you feel like cooking, go ahead.

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:47.559
If you don't, just let me know.

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:48.960
I'll come over and cook for you.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.720
Chunsheng, have some water, rest a bit.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.240
No, no, I should head back.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.559
Everything's alright?

00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:01.359
What's wrong? Is something up?

00:20:03.319 --> 00:20:06.279
Find some time to call Qiu'er.

00:20:07.559 --> 00:20:09.920
He's busy all day, who knows with what.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.039
He leaves before dawn.

00:20:12.759 --> 00:20:14.240
By night, when I'm asleep,

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:15.920
he still isn't back.

00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:18.119
I don't see him all day.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.680
Well... what's he so busy with?

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.799
I know what's on his mind.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.759
He's afraid to face people.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.519
That other home of his...

00:20:30.599 --> 00:20:32.799
He hasn't been back in a long time.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.799
Xiaoshi came looking for him,

00:20:35.039 --> 00:20:36.519
and he hid from her too.

00:20:40.119 --> 00:20:40.759
It's okay, Auntie.

00:20:40.759 --> 00:20:41.799
Don't you worry about it.

00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:43.799
I'll call him later and ask.

00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:45.799
Alright.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.160
Okay then, I'm off.

00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:49.480
You... you stay inside.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.319
Take care.

00:20:50.319 --> 00:20:51.039
It's fine.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.000
Qiu'er, what have you been up to lately?

00:21:03.039 --> 00:21:04.559
Come by our place sometime.

00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:05.319
I'll fry up some ribbonfish for you.

00:21:05.319 --> 00:21:06.519
We'll have a drink.

00:21:06.759 --> 00:21:07.880
Get back to me.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.039
Hello, the last four digits are...

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.279
six-zero-six-six.

00:21:26.039 --> 00:21:28.000
Isn't this my brother Tong?

00:21:28.759 --> 00:21:31.400
I thought your car looked familiar from a distance.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.119
How come you're driving a ride-hailing car now?

00:21:36.519 --> 00:21:37.319
Yeah, that's right.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.559
Just convenient.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.279
Pick up rides to earn some gas money.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.680
You've been picking up quite a few rides, huh?

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.759
You've got a lot of free time.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.319
Let's just follow the GPS, okay?

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.000
Fine.

00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:55.799
We're still fated to meet, aren't we?

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.960
You got fired from your job,

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.880
and I still run into you when I hail a cab.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.799
Fasten your seatbelt, thank you.

00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:05.559
Driver Tong.

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:08.240
Roll the window up.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.039
It's freezing.

00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:11.720
I'm cold too.

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:14.359
But the smell on you is too strong.

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:16.680
Watch your mouth.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.039
Mind your service attitude.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.400
I'll file a complaint against you.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.759
Window up.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.559
Driver Tong.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.440
You know, back when you were at the bank,

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.480
you were so impressive, right?

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.759
Big clients had to suck up to you.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.759
How could you even get fired from the bank?

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.000
And now you're driving this ride-hailing car.

00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:46.880
Is it hard to find a job?

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.119
Please sit properly when you talk.

00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:53.240
Alright, I'll sit properly.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.559
And I'll fasten my seatbelt too.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.400
Driver Tong.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.400
Tell me, driving for a month,

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.519
how much can you earn?

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.119
It must be more than what we made at the bank, right?

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.400
Is it enough for your mortgage, to support your family?

00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:14.359
That's none of your business.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.799
Speak properly.

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:17.880
Watch your service attitude.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.400
I can complain about this.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.160
Oh, I forgot.

00:23:23.319 --> 00:23:24.640
It's Driver Tong.

00:23:25.519 --> 00:23:27.799
You own several properties in Beijing, right?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.599
And your wife has a good job.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.519
So you're not short on cash.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.599
You, you...

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.319
You've had it easy since birth.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.799
Never had to worry about a thing.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.160
Got everything handed to you, right?

00:23:41.759 --> 00:23:43.200
Look at you.

00:23:44.319 --> 00:23:46.480
What are you moping about?

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.319
Right?

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.880
You should smile.

00:23:49.119 --> 00:23:51.240
Service with a smile, right?

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:56.599
Fine.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.279
Ignoring me.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.240
You know what I hate most about you?

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.799
What I despise the most

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:08.880
is that you always

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.559
hide in your own comfort zone.

00:24:10.759 --> 00:24:11.920
The moment you hit a rough patch,

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.160
you just slink away.

00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:16.079
And with that, you still think you're my equal?

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.640
What gives you the right?

00:24:19.519 --> 00:24:20.920
What did I do?

00:24:21.519 --> 00:24:23.720
I spent days and nights with clients,

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.680
groveling and sucking up to people.

00:24:26.359 --> 00:24:28.400
I fought tooth and nail to get where I am today.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.480
And you?

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.920
Every step you took was so smooth.

00:24:34.279 --> 00:24:36.680
Hit a problem, and you just slink away.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.119
Why?

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.000
What gives you the right?

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:45.000
You were born with a house.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.279
And me?

00:24:47.759 --> 00:24:50.400
I have to slog away my whole life.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.960
Our family house was sold long ago.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.640
Isn't your wife pregnant?

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.680
Why are you still out here driving?

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.240
Hiding from responsibility again, huh?

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.400
Unless you messed around with a client,

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.440
and your wife found out,

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.039
and she kicked you out?

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.359
Can you stop pushing your luck?

00:25:26.119 --> 00:25:26.839
Get out.

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:28.400
What do you mean? I'm not there yet.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.359
I'm not driving anymore. Get out.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.440
Tong Qiu!

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.000
I'll report you for refusing service!

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:32.559
Suit yourself.

00:25:32.559 --> 00:25:33.400
Get out.

00:25:33.799 --> 00:25:34.920
Fine, Tong Qiu.

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:36.640
You're driving a crappy ride-hailing car,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.039
what are you acting so high and mighty for?

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.200
You just wait!

00:27:34.599 --> 00:27:35.599
You're back.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:36.960
I'm back.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.680
Why are you back so late?

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.799
Yeah.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.440
Wanted to pick up more rides.

00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:54.240
Alright, go wash up and eat.

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:15.279
So much food.

00:28:16.279 --> 00:28:17.720
All your favorites.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.039
Eat up.

00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:24.000
I'm not hungry either.

00:28:25.519 --> 00:28:27.599
The baby and I have been waiting for you all evening.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.920
Let's eat together.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.279
I read a lot of moms sharing today.

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:36.880
They say we need to start nurturing the baby now.

00:28:37.759 --> 00:28:39.359
From weeks one to twelve,

00:28:39.519 --> 00:28:41.039
it's emotional prenatal education.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.400
Weeks twenty to twenty-three are for language education.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.200
You're so good at telling stories.

00:28:47.319 --> 00:28:48.160
From now on,

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:51.000
you can tell the baby a story every day.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.160
I need to discuss something with you.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.240
What is it?

00:29:03.559 --> 00:29:05.000
This house and my car,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.480
let's transfer them to your name.

00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:10.279
And also my savings,

00:29:10.279 --> 00:29:12.000
including Weiguo's five hundred thousand,

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.720
put it all with you.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.960
You know the bank card PIN too.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.480
What do you mean?

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.319
Don't you want to be with me anymore?

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.000
No.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.759
No.

00:29:41.559 --> 00:29:42.599
I'm useless.

00:29:54.279 --> 00:29:55.759
I can't provide you any security.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.640
And I can't give the child anything.

00:30:02.599 --> 00:30:05.160
I don't even know how I'll be a father.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.119
So I just think,

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.680
I should put everything I have

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.759
with you.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.319
Maybe then

00:30:19.039 --> 00:30:20.119
I can feel

00:30:22.519 --> 00:30:23.680
a little more at ease.

00:30:33.559 --> 00:30:35.880
Did I put too much pressure on you?

00:30:37.559 --> 00:30:39.799
I know you're hurting since Dad passed.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.960
Don't rush.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.200
Let's take it slow.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.200
No.

00:30:48.119 --> 00:30:51.119
You've all been more than patient with me.

00:30:55.279 --> 00:30:56.519
You... you know what?

00:30:57.759 --> 00:30:58.480
Today...

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.160
It was really coincidental.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.039
While I was driving for fares...

00:31:02.039 --> 00:31:03.480
Guess who I ran into?

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.440
Jia.

00:31:07.559 --> 00:31:09.119
He said something to me.

00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:12.119
And I think he was absolutely right.

00:31:12.519 --> 00:31:15.279
He said, "Tong Qiu...

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:19.799
you're just a loser."

00:31:24.759 --> 00:31:26.880
I wanted to argue back right then.

00:31:31.799 --> 00:31:32.839
But I couldn't.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.720
I think he's right.

00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:41.799
I am a loser.

00:31:46.039 --> 00:31:46.799
A loser.

00:31:50.319 --> 00:31:52.000
Tong Qiu, you're a loser.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Honey, do you think I...

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Tong Qiu.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.640
Mom and I...

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.599
...have sorted out the script Dad didn't finish...

00:32:39.599 --> 00:32:41.839
...and his earlier notes.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.200
Now we're giving them to you.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.799
Take good care of them.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.240
Dad wanted you to be okay.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.960
You've always listened to him, right?

00:33:23.759 --> 00:33:24.880
He was falsely accused.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.440
It was probably that Jia guy who did it.

00:33:26.599 --> 00:33:28.279
And now he's been bullied by Jia again.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.720
He's been holding in this resentment.

00:33:31.359 --> 00:33:33.440
Even though he's stopped talking about the transfer...

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.960
...he's still bottling it up, not saying a word.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.279
Big Brother, Sister-in-law...

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.119
...please talk to him for me too.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.880
Why isn't this kid answering my calls?

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.680
Let me try calling him.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.160
He's not picking up for me either.

00:34:04.039 --> 00:34:06.000
It's okay, Shi, don't worry just yet.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.519
I'll go find Weiguo.

00:34:07.519 --> 00:34:08.679
I'll have him try.

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:10.880
Okay, thank you, Big Brother.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.800
Don't worry.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.920
Let your big brother handle it.

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:16.800
How have you been lately? Doing alright?

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.559
I'm managing.

00:34:17.559 --> 00:34:19.159
You really mustn't rush things.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:55.079
Weiguo.

00:34:57.639 --> 00:34:58.559
Weiguo.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.400
Weiguo!

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.280
I said, take a break.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.119
Here, have some water. Drink up.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.239
Big Brother, I'm not tired.

00:35:19.719 --> 00:35:21.000
I have to finish these few picture frames today.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.880
I have to get them done.

00:35:40.159 --> 00:35:41.719
What's going on with him?

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.599
Ever since Grandpa Tong passed...

00:35:44.599 --> 00:35:46.119
...he hasn't been quite himself.

00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:51.000
But these past couple days...

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.880
...I've been busy with your Uncle Qiu'er's family matters...

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:53.719
...in and out...

00:35:53.719 --> 00:35:55.719
...so I didn't notice anything different about him.

00:35:57.239 --> 00:35:58.679
He's actually putting on an act.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.880
I think he's really scared.

00:36:01.039 --> 00:36:03.840
Especially as the surgery gets closer, the more scared he gets.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.119
I'll go over and talk to him.

00:36:08.119 --> 00:36:09.320
It's okay, it's okay, Uncle.

00:36:10.039 --> 00:36:11.159
Let him have a moment to himself.

00:36:11.159 --> 00:36:12.519
I'm here with him, don't you worry.

00:36:12.519 --> 00:36:14.239
You go ahead and deal with Uncle Qiu'er's stuff.

00:36:15.559 --> 00:36:18.360
Alright then. You stay with him a while.

00:36:19.199 --> 00:36:20.039
Go on.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.760
Second Brother.

00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:43.360
Come see me for a bit.

00:36:43.719 --> 00:36:45.000
I have something urgent.

00:36:45.559 --> 00:36:47.880
Big Brother, I'm a bit tied up here.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.880
I'll come back once I finish this.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.400
Fine, you tend to your business then.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.320
It'll be done soon.

00:37:27.199 --> 00:37:28.719
Do you really plan...

00:37:28.719 --> 00:37:29.960
...to be a carpenter forever?

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.599
If I really do become a carpenter in the future...

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.639
...that wouldn't be a bad choice either.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.599
That won't do.

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:42.719
You're so capable.

00:37:42.719 --> 00:37:45.039
You can do so many things.

00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:48.800
No matter what...

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.039
...take your medicine first.

00:38:06.639 --> 00:38:08.440
Weren't these just prescribed the day before yesterday?

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.840
How come there's not a single pill left?

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.199
If you don't want the surgery...

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.239
...you don't have to have it.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.480
Isn't that what you wanted?

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.119
You saw right through me.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.039
It's not that I don't want it.

00:38:45.039 --> 00:38:46.320
It's just that one second...

00:38:47.559 --> 00:38:49.199
...I saw Uncle Tong doing fine.

00:38:51.559 --> 00:38:53.239
The next second, he was gone.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.920
You know?

00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.880
He even helped us pick names.

00:39:02.239 --> 00:39:04.239
"Bamboo staff, straw sandals, lighter than a horse."

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.280
"In the scent of rice blossoms, speak of a bountiful year."

00:39:12.119 --> 00:39:13.000
Qing Nian.

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:15.920
It's a lovely name.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.599
He also told me...

00:39:22.519 --> 00:39:24.519
...he still had so many things he wanted to do.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.880
So many people he wanted to see.

00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:31.320
Actually, so do I.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.079
I also have many things I want to do.

00:39:40.239 --> 00:39:41.320
And many people...

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.920
I understand you.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.039
I understand completely.

00:39:54.679 --> 00:39:55.800
Let's not put so much...

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.559
...pressure on ourselves anymore, okay?

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.840
And let's not overthink things either.

00:40:02.239 --> 00:40:03.679
From now on...

00:40:04.599 --> 00:40:07.559
...every single day has to be a happy one.

00:40:09.119 --> 00:40:10.679
I'll be with you all the way.

00:40:13.239 --> 00:40:14.760
No matter the outcome...

00:40:15.639 --> 00:40:17.159
Whether it's a year...

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.480
...three months...

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.199
...or even less time...

00:40:25.639 --> 00:40:27.119
...let's not worry.

00:40:27.679 --> 00:40:29.159
Let's be happy every day.

00:40:30.159 --> 00:40:32.239
I promise I'll always be by your side.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.880
Say it.

00:40:53.239 --> 00:40:54.599
It'll feel better once you say it.

00:40:56.719 --> 00:40:57.960
I'm right here.

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.239
What's going on here?

00:41:27.039 --> 00:41:28.320
Weiguo, he...

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.920
...doesn't seem right.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.880
What do you mean, not right?

00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:36.719
He's wearing his glasses.

00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:40.800
This is what the doctor said...

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.119
...about something pressing on his...

00:41:44.119 --> 00:41:45.239
...optic nerve.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.360
It's pressing on the optic nerve.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.079
What do we do then?
