WEBVTT

00:00:06.475 --> 00:00:08.114
What should we have for dinner tonight?

00:00:14.875 --> 00:00:16.115
That woman

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:18.875
actually went out with Tan Zuoyan.

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:30.555
Shujing.

00:00:30.954 --> 00:00:32.754
Marry me.

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:40.554
That way, I can openly and legitimately

00:00:40.555 --> 00:00:43.075
stand at your side
and dig up the Tan family's crimes.

00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:44.993
Otherwise, you'll forever remain

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:49.195
an accomplice bound
to Tan Jianfei's guilty blood.

00:00:57.994 --> 00:00:59.475
It's not time yet.

00:01:05.354 --> 00:01:07.034
You still cannot let him go.

00:01:07.274 --> 00:01:08.235
Li Shujing.

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:09.994
You are pathetic!

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:10.834
Look carefully.

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:11.873
Look closely.

00:01:11.874 --> 00:01:13.793
Every single brick in this house

00:01:13.794 --> 00:01:15.594
is etched with the marks of the rope

00:01:15.595 --> 00:01:18.235
his father used
to kill your entire family.

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:21.554
The two of you
are never meant to be together.

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:25.114
Tan Zuoyan, calm down.

00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:29.353
What are you doing?

00:01:29.354 --> 00:01:31.394
Tan Zuoyan, let go of me!

00:01:32.794 --> 00:01:33.875
Let go!

00:01:40.675 --> 00:01:41.795
Tonight,

00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:44.834
I'll have you no matter what.

00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:49.754
What are you doing?

00:02:06.487 --> 00:02:07.979

Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:16.235
Tan Zuoyan.

00:03:30.995 --> 00:03:32.434
Why?

00:03:32.954 --> 00:03:34.474
Ever since we were young,

00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:36.793
you've taken everything from me!

00:03:36.794 --> 00:03:38.635
I never wanted to compete with you.

00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:40.994
You were just too greedy.

00:03:41.195 --> 00:03:42.394
But this time,

00:03:43.435 --> 00:03:45.035
I'll never let you go.

00:03:53.354 --> 00:03:54.554
Li Shujing!

00:03:55.114 --> 00:03:58.075
Do you really think
he is any cleaner than I am?

00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:02.355
The rope your father used
to hang himself

00:04:02.834 --> 00:04:05.954
was handed by Tan Jianfei!

00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:19.475
Do you believe that?

00:04:22.035 --> 00:04:23.074
I believe you.

Why not get a coffee first?

00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:50.355
Are you trying to keep your guest

00:07:06.515 --> 00:07:07.235
Alright.

00:07:07.835 --> 00:07:10.035
You have thirty seconds
to make breakfast.

00:07:12.874 --> 00:07:15.074
Otherwise, I'm going into the meeting
on an empty stomach.

Last night's body temperature.

00:07:34.635 --> 00:07:36.193
Then it seems

00:07:36.194 --> 00:07:38.194
the thermometer needs servicing.

00:07:39.395 --> 00:07:41.715
My normal body temperature

00:07:42.874 --> 00:07:44.754
is 36.2 °C.

00:07:46.354 --> 00:07:47.715
Then let us

00:07:47.915 --> 00:07:49.395
check it right now.

00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:53.594
Tan Jianfei, what are you doing?

00:07:53.595 --> 00:07:54.753
Stop it.

00:07:54.754 --> 00:07:55.955
Stop.

00:07:56.794 --> 00:07:58.275
That is too hot.

00:08:02.994 --> 00:08:03.793
Sir,

00:08:03.794 --> 00:08:04.673
Last night,

00:08:04.674 --> 00:08:07.475
Li Shujing stayed over
at Mr. Tan's place again.

00:08:09.194 --> 00:08:10.594
I know. I know.

00:08:10.595 --> 00:08:13.314
Do not mention that woman's name
to me again!

00:08:14.354 --> 00:08:15.155
Then,

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:17.155
should we keep watching her?

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:23.673
Yes.

00:08:23.674 --> 00:08:24.674
Understood.

00:08:26.194 --> 00:08:27.114
Wait.

00:08:28.354 --> 00:08:29.834
Any news on the old man?

00:08:29.835 --> 00:08:31.114
Not yet.

00:08:37.837 --> 00:08:40.111

(You're not added as a contact.
Voice call is unavailable. Okay)

00:08:47.314 --> 00:08:49.235
Li Shujing is impressive.

(Tan Group)

00:09:08.954 --> 00:09:10.555
What brings Mr. Tan here?

00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:11.794
Shujing.

00:09:13.074 --> 00:09:14.355
About yesterday,

00:09:17.954 --> 00:09:19.595
I should not have forced you.

00:09:20.115 --> 00:09:21.154
Mr. Tan,

00:09:21.434 --> 00:09:23.514
there is no need for an apology.

00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:26.355
That was yesterday.

00:09:28.395 --> 00:09:30.195
I knew you would be gracious.

00:09:32.474 --> 00:09:33.394
This...

00:09:36.474 --> 00:09:38.274
I won't bring it up again.

00:09:38.674 --> 00:09:40.193
But surely we can still

00:09:40.194 --> 00:09:41.475
continue working together.

00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:46.075
I didn't expect you to be so naive.

00:09:48.395 --> 00:09:51.235
If I say we could still cooperate,

00:09:51.954 --> 00:09:53.315
would you believe it?

00:09:57.915 --> 00:09:58.874
It dropped.

00:10:02.395 --> 00:10:03.593
Do you need me to teach you

00:10:03.594 --> 00:10:05.034
how to pick things up?

00:10:10.074 --> 00:10:11.235
First, bend down.

00:10:11.635 --> 00:10:12.955
Then lower your head.

00:10:13.834 --> 00:10:15.555
After that, leave.

00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:18.274
Do not harass me again.

00:10:25.554 --> 00:10:26.555
Li Shujing.

00:10:27.035 --> 00:10:28.114
You've been playing

00:10:28.115 --> 00:10:31.435
the obedient fiancée
for all these years.

00:10:35.115 --> 00:10:37.394
Just for this attitude?

00:10:40.235 --> 00:10:41.754
Don't push me.

00:10:45.674 --> 00:10:47.274
Sorry, Mr. Tan.

00:10:47.395 --> 00:10:50.075
I thought you were about to treat me
the same way you did yesterday.

00:10:51.035 --> 00:10:52.394
Li Shujing.

00:10:52.395 --> 00:10:53.394
Ms. Li.

00:10:54.074 --> 00:10:55.195

It seems some people

00:11:00.314 --> 00:11:01.354
still have not learned

00:11:01.355 --> 00:11:03.114
how to stand on their own two feet.

00:11:23.434 --> 00:11:24.553
Disinfect this thing

00:11:24.554 --> 00:11:27.034
and donate it to
an animal rescue charity.

00:11:57.115 --> 00:11:58.235
Li Shujing,

00:11:58.355 --> 00:11:59.675
since you show no mercy,

00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:01.274
I won't either.

00:12:02.714 --> 00:12:03.754
