WEBVTT

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.079
You two seem to have a great relationship.

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.879
Should we put the photo up on the wall?

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.040
No, I don't want to.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.079
Why not?

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.079
Don't you want to make it public?

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.640
Are you embarrassed to be with me?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.159
That's not it at all!

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.280
Then why?

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:01.519
I just don't want to put it up.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:02.719
So childish.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:03.799
What's childish about it?

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:04.200
Help us put it up.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.000
Help us put it up.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.799
Sure thing!

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.599
President Qin.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.039
What is it?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.159
What's this?

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.039
This is what Secretary Lin sent me last night.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.759
What are you looking at?

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:57.560
Go on in.

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:58.680
Where's Secretary Lin?

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.759
Seriously, Old Qin?

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:02.839
I'm your own daughter!

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.759
Why are you always thinking of others at a time like this?

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:05.959
You dislike me that much?

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:06.480
Then I'm leaving.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.720
What do you mean 'others'?

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.199
Isn't he your boyfriend?

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.399
Him...

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.680
We broke up.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.360
Look at you.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.959
I told you.

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.079
When you're in a relationship,

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:22.959
you have to be reasonable.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.399
Were you too willful again?

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.920
Who can stand you being so self-centered?

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.519
Say something!

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:29.720
Exactly.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.560
It's all because you spoiled her.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.879
Look at this personality.

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:33.759
What do we do?

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:34.959
She takes after you, I'm telling you.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.199
I didn't tell you to criticize her.

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.160
Why are you blaming me?

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.600
Dad, Mom.

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:39.279
I have work at the company, I'm leaving.

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:40.399
Hurry up and arrange them for her.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.839
Twenty meetings a day, you hear?

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:43.680
I refuse to believe not one will be suitable.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.160
I can arrange thirty if I have to.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.560
But Secretary Lin is a good person.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.199
He is a good person.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.319
But your daughter won't have it.

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:50.399
Why did she leave?

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:53.120
Look what you did.

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:54.759
So stubborn.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.519
Look at you.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.079
I told you, when you're in a relationship, you have to be reasonable.

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:09.680
Were you too willful?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.759
You're so self-centered.

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:11.959
Who can stand you?

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.079
I'm sorry, miss.

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:24.199
The park is closed for the day.

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.079
We're not admitting any more visitors.

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:26.040
Sorry, sorry.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.000
She made a mistake.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.759
Please, go right in.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.680
You stopped her?

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.879
That's Young Master Lin's girlfriend.

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:36.560
What?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.360
You didn't know?

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.600
She was the one who came with him last time.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.319
Then why did they come separately this time?

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.360
Maybe...

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.480
I hope Secretary Lin never leaves.

00:08:58.639 --> 00:08:59.440
I love you.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.399
Qin Meili.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.399
I can't hear you!

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.240
I love you!

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.039
Can't hear you!

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.200
I love you!

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.279
I love you, Qin Meili!

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:48.000
Let's go.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.480
I don't want to go.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.360
Don't pull me.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.320
Stop pulling me!

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.039
I'm not going.

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:51.360
No way.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.080
I carefully picked out that bridesmaid dress.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.240
When did I agree

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.080
to be your bridesmaid?

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.840
I'm not going.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.679
You're so heartless.

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:57.200
Let's go.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.360
I'm not going.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.679
To make up for last time's regret,

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.039
and to prevent tragedy from happening again,

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:08.480
we've decided to give you a big gift.

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:10.519
Take this!

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.639
So incredibly childish.

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:14.320
Don't embarrass us.

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:17.000
We've already remarried.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.080
How can you talk

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.840
so harshly still?

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.200
I...

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.279
That was just a reluctant compromise for the kids.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.360
Who isn't doing it for the kids?

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:30.360
Hurry up and look.

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:03.639
Is this a bridesmaid dress?

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:15.960
I'm sorry.

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:18.240
I really didn't know

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.200
how to find you

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.519
without being rejected.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.039
Marry me.

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:32.320
Will you marry me?

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:33.320
Qin Meili.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.240
But I said...

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:38.679
I...

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:39.159
I accept.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.559
I accept that I'm the one who was chosen.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.799
Because you are Qin Meili.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.120
And I believe in Qin Meili.

00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:01.120
I do.

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:03.960
So sweet.

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:47.039
That's...

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.120
That's it?

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:49.759
Nothing more?

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:50.879
What else?

00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:54.080
There has to be a wedding!

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.080
Right!

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.360
Otherwise, all our

00:12:57.679 --> 00:12:58.600
hard work

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:00.320
was for nothing?

00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:02.200
Forget it.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:02.799
Wrap it up, everyone.

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:03.000
Never mind.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.480
Let's go.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.200
Groom

00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:11.759
Do you take this

00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:13.159
beautiful lady as your wife?

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.919
For better or for worse,

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.279
in sickness and in health,

00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:18.480
to have and to hold,

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.120
to love her,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.159
to cherish her,

00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:22.000
and to care for her,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.000
till death do you part?

00:13:24.919 --> 00:13:25.720
I do.

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:27.279
Bride

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.519
Do you take

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.279
Enough with the talk.

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:29.840
I do.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.279
Then let's do it.

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:33.559
We don't have the ring.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.000
The ring.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.320
Okay.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.519
Grow old together.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.960
We're finally done, right?

00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:02.360
Not yet.

00:14:03.679 --> 00:14:04.759
What else?

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.559
A new, beautiful chapter of life

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:18.879
is about to begin.

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:21.120
Yes.

00:15:21.679 --> 00:15:23.120
My dear secretary.
