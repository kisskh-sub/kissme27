Then tell me, who put you up to this?

00:01:40.532 --> 00:01:41.653
Here we go again.

00:01:41.653 --> 00:01:42.732
You are unreasonable.

00:01:42.972 --> 00:01:44.133
Poor choice of words.

00:01:44.332 --> 00:01:46.413
What do you mean by "put up to"?

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:47.413
You...

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.853
Mr. Wang, Mr. Zheng speaks bluntly.

00:01:51.053 --> 00:01:52.892
To put it plainly, we just want to know

00:01:53.172 --> 00:01:54.732
if this is a sudden regulation,

00:01:55.293 --> 00:01:56.732
which department issued it?

00:01:57.213 --> 00:01:58.413
Well...

00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:03.732
Well...

00:02:03.812 --> 00:02:05.493
Wang Defa, are you going
to the bathroom?

00:02:07.892 --> 00:02:08.332
No.

00:02:10.892 --> 00:02:13.492
You know those
Power Supply Bureau leaders well.

00:02:13.573 --> 00:02:15.452
Please, I beg you.
Let me go to the bathroom.

00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:19.212
Government Office.

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:20.172
Liu Dan.

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:21.652
I didn't say anything.

00:02:31.612 --> 00:02:32.293
Who is it?

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:40.492
Coming!

00:02:49.693 --> 00:02:51.492
Why are you standing? Have a seat.

00:02:54.093 --> 00:02:54.853
How impressive.

00:02:55.212 --> 00:02:57.253
Just come. Don't bring anything.

00:02:59.093 --> 00:03:00.212
I have something for you.

00:03:11.813 --> 00:03:13.853
The other day, you looked pale.

00:03:14.452 --> 00:03:15.853
Take these lotus seeds. Brew them.

00:03:16.293 --> 00:03:16.732
Okay.

00:03:19.973 --> 00:03:20.693
Take a seat.

00:03:21.772 --> 00:03:24.573
Tang, we have a guest! Didn't you hear?

00:03:24.932 --> 00:03:25.693
Keep it down.

00:03:26.693 --> 00:03:27.253
Okay.

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:32.052
Why are you still standing? Take a seat.

00:03:34.296 --> 00:03:35.576
(Rouyan)

00:03:41.892 --> 00:03:43.612
Liu, about that...

00:03:45.732 --> 00:03:47.093
What did I want to ask?

00:03:51.813 --> 00:03:52.573
Oh, I remember.

00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:04.452
Look at these colors.

00:04:04.652 --> 00:04:06.253
Which looks better for knitting a hat?

00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:07.853
A hat?

00:04:08.813 --> 00:04:10.133
This one. This one's nice.

00:04:12.973 --> 00:04:13.533
Alright then.

00:04:14.573 --> 00:04:15.332
I trust your taste.

00:04:31.652 --> 00:04:34.092
Liu, regarding Binhai Road...

00:04:34.133 --> 00:04:35.053
That has nothing...

00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:39.800
Is Zheng Decheng

00:04:40.632 --> 00:04:41.892
even a man?

00:04:42.733 --> 00:04:45.733
Why didn't he come personally?
Why are you taking the heat?

00:04:47.493 --> 00:04:48.292
And you,

00:04:48.772 --> 00:04:51.412
don't be foolish and let others
use you as a pawn.

00:04:51.972 --> 00:04:52.852
Don't get involved.

00:04:56.092 --> 00:04:56.712
Liu,

00:04:57.432 --> 00:04:59.173
I simply can't stay out of this.

00:04:59.972 --> 00:05:02.613
After all, both you and the cadres
were invited by me.

00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:05.933
And from my campaign until now,

00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:08.332
you've always supported me
behind the scenes.

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:11.693
I owe you a formal apology.

00:05:12.972 --> 00:05:13.852
Off topic.

00:05:21.892 --> 00:05:22.452
By the way,

00:05:23.373 --> 00:05:25.693
Liu, about Yuehai's
electricity standards,

00:05:26.053 --> 00:05:28.373
could you consider restoring them
to how they were before?

00:05:29.493 --> 00:05:31.133
About the power supply,

00:05:31.693 --> 00:05:33.253
a new regulation was recently issued.

00:05:35.053 --> 00:05:37.813
Previously, we did give
preferential treatment to Yuehai,

00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:41.412
but other towns objected,
calling it unfair.

00:05:42.452 --> 00:05:43.292
What could we do?

00:05:44.652 --> 00:05:46.104
It seems difficult

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.013
to favor you again later.

00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:50.212
Just favor us a little bit.

00:05:52.253 --> 00:05:53.208
I'm just

00:05:53.403 --> 00:05:55.253
a cadre from the Government Office.

00:05:56.412 --> 00:05:58.693
How could I override regulations?

00:05:58.852 --> 00:06:01.733
Liu, here's the situation.

00:06:03.253 --> 00:06:05.373
With these sudden
and prolonged blackouts,

00:06:05.852 --> 00:06:08.133
the businesses weren't prepared.

00:06:08.772 --> 00:06:11.173
Without power,
they can't complete production,

00:06:11.613 --> 00:06:12.892
so they can't fulfill orders.

00:06:13.133 --> 00:06:15.573
The losses are enormous.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.253
Liu, how about this?

00:06:22.412 --> 00:06:23.693
I drafted a proposal.

00:06:28.092 --> 00:06:29.092
Let's take it together

00:06:29.852 --> 00:06:31.452
to report to Mr. Xia.

00:06:37.332 --> 00:06:38.013
Qiuping,

00:06:38.892 --> 00:06:41.772
in what capacity
are you visiting me today?

00:06:43.613 --> 00:06:45.292
As my longtime good friend?

00:06:46.292 --> 00:06:47.573
Or as the Mayor of Yuehai?

00:06:52.373 --> 00:06:53.412
As the Mayor of Yuehai.

00:06:58.373 --> 00:06:59.013
Okay.

00:07:00.212 --> 00:07:01.173
Ms. Li,

00:07:03.493 --> 00:07:04.892
let's stop beating around the bush.

00:07:05.412 --> 00:07:06.733
Tell me honestly.

00:07:08.373 --> 00:07:09.292
Regarding Binhai Road,

00:07:10.133 --> 00:07:11.772
what exactly are your plans?

00:07:12.652 --> 00:07:13.292
To whom?

00:07:22.892 --> 00:07:24.053
Liu, I'm sorry.

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:32.253
Back then,

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:35.772
you came to me first, right?

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:38.253
You asked me to lead

00:07:39.573 --> 00:07:40.892
the mobilization of all cadres

00:07:41.652 --> 00:07:43.373
to support Yuehai's development.

00:07:48.452 --> 00:07:50.813
The cadres didn't have faith in Yuehai.

00:07:52.733 --> 00:07:53.452
It was me.

00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:55.613
I did it for you.

00:07:56.892 --> 00:07:58.253
I was trying to help you.

00:08:00.053 --> 00:08:02.452
I persuaded them one by one.

00:08:04.652 --> 00:08:05.412
In the end,

00:08:07.212 --> 00:08:08.933
over a thousand cadres

00:08:09.933 --> 00:08:11.332
took their household registers,

00:08:11.933 --> 00:08:13.573
ready to pay fees in Yuehai.

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:15.960
But what did you do?

00:08:16.613 --> 00:08:18.532
You backed out without warning.

00:08:21.173 --> 00:08:22.092
You even made excuses,

00:08:23.173 --> 00:08:25.772
talking about building
a printing street.

00:08:26.212 --> 00:08:27.013
Let's be blunt.

00:08:28.173 --> 00:08:30.013
Aren't you just driven by greed?

00:08:31.452 --> 00:08:32.613
For a bit of money,

00:08:33.052 --> 00:08:35.172
you made fools of all our cadres.

00:08:38.333 --> 00:08:39.572
What do you take me for?

00:08:41.692 --> 00:08:43.453
Do you even consider me
your good friend?

00:08:47.253 --> 00:08:48.892
Is this how cadres should behave?

00:08:51.133 --> 00:08:52.532
What kind of cadres are you?

00:08:55.892 --> 00:08:57.572
Liu, I understand.

00:08:58.373 --> 00:08:59.652
I'm truly sorry.

00:09:00.652 --> 00:09:02.652
I compromised my principles.

00:09:03.172 --> 00:09:04.733
I betrayed the trust you placed in me.

00:09:06.253 --> 00:09:06.853
But

00:09:07.093 --> 00:09:09.733
Yuehai genuinely needs this street.

00:09:10.093 --> 00:09:11.973
We need this pillar industry.

00:09:19.812 --> 00:09:20.692
No matter what,

00:09:21.213 --> 00:09:23.093
we will give you a proper explanation.

00:09:24.853 --> 00:09:25.572
However,

00:09:26.613 --> 00:09:27.772
this power outage...

00:09:29.772 --> 00:09:31.892
The power issue was approved
by Government Office

00:09:32.013 --> 00:09:34.172
in a meeting based
on the latest regulations.

00:09:35.172 --> 00:09:36.133
If you have objections,

00:09:36.572 --> 00:09:39.013
report them to higher-ups
through proper channels.

00:09:43.453 --> 00:09:44.093
Furthermore,

00:09:45.133 --> 00:09:46.892
the Binhai Road issue isn't settled.

00:09:48.892 --> 00:09:50.093
Tell Zheng Decheng.

00:09:51.093 --> 00:09:53.733
We've only ever wanted Binhai Road.

00:09:54.213 --> 00:09:55.853
Don't try fobbing us off
with other roads.

00:09:57.373 --> 00:09:59.013
All the cadres' household registers

00:09:59.373 --> 00:10:00.373
are now with Yuehai.

00:10:01.292 --> 00:10:03.692
I'll bring people at 8 AM tomorrow.

00:10:04.052 --> 00:10:05.133
I expect your explanation.

00:10:09.532 --> 00:10:11.652
Tang, that was a lovely song earlier.

00:10:12.373 --> 00:10:13.133
Sing it again.

00:10:13.733 --> 00:10:14.333

Okay, here's some for you.

How much for the tomatoes?

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:47.172
Two yuan.

00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:53.373
Stir-fried noodles, rice noodles,
and shredded pancakes here!

00:13:07.373 --> 00:13:08.373
Still no power?

00:13:10.932 --> 00:13:11.853
No power today.

00:13:12.253 --> 00:13:15.013
Liu said she'll come tomorrow morning
to process the paperwork.

00:13:17.093 --> 00:13:18.052
Do you change your mind?

00:13:18.652 --> 00:13:19.292
No.

00:13:20.613 --> 00:13:21.973
Then I have an idea now.

00:13:22.733 --> 00:13:24.052
I also have an idea.

00:13:24.613 --> 00:13:25.932
How about tonight we...

00:13:26.253 --> 00:13:27.373
- We must collect the fees.
- We must collect the fees.

00:13:29.613 --> 00:13:30.333
Are you sure?

00:13:34.532 --> 00:13:36.453
Then let's notify them right now.

00:13:36.932 --> 00:13:38.093
Only the two of us know?

00:13:39.052 --> 00:13:40.172
Even we don't know.

00:13:41.532 --> 00:13:43.892
I'll be brief.
The situation is complicated.

00:13:44.453 --> 00:13:46.812
I hope to get your Binhai Road
paperwork done quickly

00:13:46.932 --> 00:13:48.052
to avoid complications.

00:13:48.333 --> 00:13:49.013
Understood?

00:13:49.253 --> 00:13:49.973
Understood.

00:13:50.013 --> 00:13:50.652
Understood.

00:13:50.932 --> 00:13:53.013
This paperwork
must be kept confidential.

00:13:53.253 --> 00:13:56.172
Calculate the total
city construction fees for Binhai Road.

00:13:56.453 --> 00:13:57.624
Starting tonight at 10 PM,

00:13:57.703 --> 00:13:59.493
we must gather it all by 6 AM tomorrow.

00:13:59.812 --> 00:14:02.052
Remember, we only have one night.

00:14:03.853 --> 00:14:04.453
Okay.

00:14:04.973 --> 00:14:06.853
But won't you doing this...

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:07.853
Don't worry.

00:14:08.133 --> 00:14:09.172
We've thought it through.

00:14:09.733 --> 00:14:12.013
We'll report to Mr. Zhao
before 9 AM tomorrow.

00:14:12.772 --> 00:14:13.292
Right.

00:14:13.532 --> 00:14:15.812
Before Liu Dan comes to Yuehai
to do the paperwork.

00:14:16.292 --> 00:14:17.333
Okay.

00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:18.412
We're so grateful to you.

00:14:18.532 --> 00:14:19.133
Thank you.

00:14:19.453 --> 00:14:20.932
Thank you, Ms. Li, Mr. Zheng.

00:14:20.932 --> 00:14:22.373
- Thank you, Ms. Li.
- Wonderful!

00:14:22.532 --> 00:14:23.213
Thanks!

00:14:24.013 --> 00:14:25.973
What? Three months?

00:14:27.292 --> 00:14:29.253
Impossible! Absolutely impossible!

00:14:29.493 --> 00:14:31.133
Don't tell me that.

00:14:31.772 --> 00:14:32.973
It's not a discussion.

00:14:33.532 --> 00:14:34.613
I am telling you.

00:14:35.093 --> 00:14:37.692
Construction of Xingfu Road must be
completed in three months.

00:14:37.812 --> 00:14:40.613
Even if you rush,
you must consider feasibility.

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:44.052
Before, you told us to complete
in six months, right?

00:14:44.052 --> 00:14:47.853
Now you're cutting it down
to three months. I really can't do it.

00:14:48.133 --> 00:14:50.572
In Shenzhen,
they build a story in three days.

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:51.612
But in Yuehai,

00:14:51.992 --> 00:14:54.412
why can't road construction
be completed in three months?

00:14:54.412 --> 00:14:55.853
How can you talk about Yuehai speed?

00:14:56.052 --> 00:14:58.013
How can we compare with Shenzhen?

00:14:58.013 --> 00:15:00.453
They have countless
engineers and machinery.

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.373
Just talking about speed is useless.

00:15:02.733 --> 00:15:03.613
Anyway, Listen.

00:15:04.052 --> 00:15:05.652
You must get this done!

00:15:05.853 --> 00:15:08.572
Otherwise, I can't explain things
to the cadres about Binhai Road.

00:15:11.013 --> 00:15:11.932
Mr. Zheng, you...

00:15:13.093 --> 00:15:13.812
Look here.

00:15:14.652 --> 00:15:17.613
(Yuehai Town Master Plan)
Xingfu Road here is 910 meters long.

00:15:17.772 --> 00:15:19.692
You know how wide
the main road is, right?

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:21.983
Down below, I need to lay

00:15:21.983 --> 00:15:23.493
eight underground pipelines.

00:15:23.572 --> 00:15:24.133
I also need...

00:15:24.172 --> 00:15:26.133
Don't tell me all this.

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:27.652
I don't want to hear it.

00:15:27.812 --> 00:15:29.333
I only care about results! Got it?

00:15:31.133 --> 00:15:31.772
Mr. Zheng.

00:15:33.812 --> 00:15:34.453
What's up?

00:15:35.253 --> 00:15:35.853
Five months.

00:15:36.652 --> 00:15:37.572
I guarantee completion.

00:15:37.892 --> 00:15:38.493
Three months.

00:15:39.973 --> 00:15:40.692
Four months.

00:15:42.772 --> 00:15:45.613
Lin Tofu! You're haggling
with me now, right?

00:15:46.133 --> 00:15:46.652
Three months.

00:15:47.093 --> 00:15:49.973
You'll do it no matter what.

00:15:50.692 --> 00:15:52.772
I told you. I can't do it!

00:15:55.652 --> 00:15:57.853
Lin Tofu, you...
You're getting defiant now?

00:15:58.652 --> 00:15:59.672
Daring to slam my door!

00:16:00.412 --> 00:16:01.453
This... This is your room!

00:16:01.853 --> 00:16:03.292
Why are you slamming the door?

00:16:17.172 --> 00:16:17.892
Who's there?

00:16:21.772 --> 00:16:23.453
Why did you put money in the fridge?

00:16:24.052 --> 00:16:24.812
Turn it off.

00:16:26.453 --> 00:16:27.253
You scared me!

00:16:27.532 --> 00:16:28.892
What if my dad sees it?

00:16:29.292 --> 00:16:30.973
He's been staying at the office lately,

00:16:31.253 --> 00:16:32.733
dealing with the power outage issue.

00:16:32.853 --> 00:16:34.052
He's quite dedicated.

00:16:34.973 --> 00:16:36.052
Need any help?

00:16:36.532 --> 00:16:38.973
The best help is you leaving
and shutting the door, my dear.

00:16:41.253 --> 00:16:42.892
You'll give me a heart attack one day.

00:16:47.932 --> 00:16:48.652
Xuemei,

00:16:49.532 --> 00:16:50.932
our funds are in place.

00:16:51.453 --> 00:16:53.493
How much do we have in total?

00:16:54.772 --> 00:16:55.812
Over 3.5 million.

00:16:57.292 --> 00:16:58.292
Time is limited.

00:16:58.373 --> 00:17:01.052
When can we gather 5.7 million?

00:17:02.013 --> 00:17:03.333
Such a big gap?

00:17:04.733 --> 00:17:05.933
Let me think.

00:17:07.173 --> 00:17:08.052
Here's the thing.

00:17:08.812 --> 00:17:09.532
Let's pool it.

00:17:10.013 --> 00:17:12.532
I have 80,000 yuan at home.
It's my last savings.

00:17:12.973 --> 00:17:13.772
I'll fetch it later.

00:17:21.612 --> 00:17:24.413
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...

00:17:27.213 --> 00:17:27.893
Thanks.

00:17:32.973 --> 00:17:33.432
Wait.

00:17:34.072 --> 00:17:36.052
Shine all you want.
It won't come out right.

00:17:37.132 --> 00:17:38.332
I've handed over all my money.

00:17:38.772 --> 00:17:40.812
Everything at home adds up
to less than 20,000.

00:17:41.413 --> 00:17:42.933
No. Even combined, it's not enough!

00:17:43.372 --> 00:17:45.332
Weren't you broke
when I asked to repay last time?

00:17:45.693 --> 00:17:47.733
It was nearly 20,000.

00:17:47.812 --> 00:17:48.852
It was less than 20,000.

00:17:49.532 --> 00:17:51.052
Still not enough.

00:17:52.653 --> 00:17:53.612
Time is running out.

00:17:54.173 --> 00:17:55.103
Alright, Fatty.

00:17:55.384 --> 00:17:58.132
Later, let's go out together
and borrow money door-to-door.

00:17:58.372 --> 00:17:59.693
We must secure Binhai Road.

00:18:00.372 --> 00:18:02.933
Right! Go find Chen Hui.

00:18:03.372 --> 00:18:04.612
I heard that recently,

00:18:05.132 --> 00:18:07.384
he landed an overseas order
and would make good money.

00:18:07.532 --> 00:18:08.572
Also, the one who

00:18:09.132 --> 00:18:10.893
split orders with us, Liu Jingcai.

00:18:11.013 --> 00:18:11.532
Liu Jingcai.

00:18:11.612 --> 00:18:12.893
- He doesn't need money now.
- Right.

00:18:12.973 --> 00:18:14.612
He had outstanding entry at my place.

00:18:14.612 --> 00:18:15.453
At least, it was...

00:18:15.453 --> 00:18:16.453
Aunties and uncles,

00:18:16.453 --> 00:18:18.052
get all the money over here.

00:18:18.213 --> 00:18:18.933
Who hasn't?

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:20.812
I've borrowed
from every relative possible.

00:18:21.132 --> 00:18:22.733
If we can get this done

00:18:22.933 --> 00:18:24.973
and pay before the cadres
in the county...

00:18:25.413 --> 00:18:26.852
Get that certificate approved.

00:18:27.092 --> 00:18:28.253
Not sure about the plan.

00:18:28.253 --> 00:18:30.493
We still need to prepare
other things at home.

00:18:30.493 --> 00:18:31.852
We can set things up properly.

00:19:57.973 --> 00:19:58.532
Hello.

00:20:01.453 --> 00:20:02.132
Good morning.

00:20:07.253 --> 00:20:09.532
Mr. Zhao, I have something
to report to you.

00:20:10.332 --> 00:20:10.933
Come on up.

00:20:15.612 --> 00:20:16.253
Go on.

00:20:28.132 --> 00:20:28.812
Gentlemen,

00:20:29.453 --> 00:20:30.232
over a thousand

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.572
cadres in our county

00:20:33.173 --> 00:20:34.532
report under our real names.

00:20:35.132 --> 00:20:37.013
This has all the cadres' signatures.

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:39.653
We strongly condemn Zheng Decheng.

00:20:40.213 --> 00:20:41.852
We demand he be punished.

00:20:49.653 --> 00:20:51.013
Our original intention

00:20:51.733 --> 00:20:52.888
is that we are all actually

00:20:53.304 --> 00:20:54.852
responding to the call.

00:20:58.292 --> 00:21:01.292
We were actively supporting
the construction of Yuehai.

00:21:02.332 --> 00:21:04.733
As for Zheng Decheng,
he also promised us.

00:21:05.092 --> 00:21:07.612
He signed to give us Binhai Road.

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:11.572
Take a look.

00:21:13.292 --> 00:21:14.253
His signature.

00:21:14.693 --> 00:21:16.772
(Letter of Intent)
And his name is here, Zheng Decheng.

00:21:17.253 --> 00:21:19.213
How... How did it become like this?

00:21:19.453 --> 00:21:21.132
He signed it,
but didn't want to admit it.

00:21:21.493 --> 00:21:23.532
He wanted to eat it.
He swallowed it whole.

00:21:23.812 --> 00:21:25.852
I snatched this from his mouth.

00:21:26.413 --> 00:21:27.896
You tell me. As a leader,

00:21:28.152 --> 00:21:29.733
he signed it, but now he's backing out.

00:21:29.893 --> 00:21:32.052
Moreover,
after our communication failed,

00:21:32.332 --> 00:21:35.092
he gave that road
to someone else overnight!

00:21:35.893 --> 00:21:38.092
What kind of behavior is this?
What kind...

00:21:39.693 --> 00:21:41.173
What kind of behavior is this?

00:21:41.653 --> 00:21:42.232
Mr. Zhao,

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.812
Zheng Decheng signed it,
yet still did this.

00:21:45.052 --> 00:21:47.852
How could he go back on his word?
He must be severely punished.

00:21:48.173 --> 00:21:49.653
That's right. How could he do this?

00:21:50.132 --> 00:21:51.733
He can't take Binhai Road back!

00:21:51.733 --> 00:21:52.253
That's right.

00:21:52.292 --> 00:21:53.453
He must be severely punished.

00:21:53.493 --> 00:21:54.372
Severely punished.

00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:55.292
He can't take it back.

00:21:56.572 --> 00:21:57.693
- Right.
- Absolutely cannot let this happen.

00:21:58.332 --> 00:22:00.653
The news spreads really fast.

00:22:02.772 --> 00:22:03.532
Regret it now?

00:22:04.532 --> 00:22:05.372
What do you think?

00:22:08.852 --> 00:22:09.693
Go back and wait.

00:22:24.612 --> 00:22:26.612
You two go wait
in the conference room downstairs.

00:22:37.132 --> 00:22:38.332
(Petition)
Look at your achievements.

00:22:40.413 --> 00:22:41.624
Over 1,000 people accused you.

00:22:42.693 --> 00:22:43.413
And this.

00:22:45.292 --> 00:22:46.332
You bit this, didn't you?

00:22:47.372 --> 00:22:50.013
It was snatched from your mouth.
She said you ate it.

00:22:50.612 --> 00:22:52.532
I find this ridiculous, you know?

00:22:55.292 --> 00:22:56.253
Well done, Li.

00:22:57.052 --> 00:22:58.493
You just acted before reporting.

00:22:59.893 --> 00:23:01.812
You took the money,
completed the procedures.

00:23:02.372 --> 00:23:04.052
and rushed here overnight
like a heroine.

00:23:04.532 --> 00:23:06.413
You think that way I won't punish you?

00:23:06.973 --> 00:23:09.332
Mr. Zhao, the Binhai Road incident

00:23:09.493 --> 00:23:11.013
is indeed our mistake.

00:23:11.332 --> 00:23:12.572
We should be punished.

00:23:13.612 --> 00:23:15.372
(Conference Room)
But the people of Yuehai

00:23:15.653 --> 00:23:17.772
have nothing to do with this.

00:23:18.213 --> 00:23:20.693
Could you first help us coordinate

00:23:21.332 --> 00:23:22.933
to restore the electricity in Yuehai?

00:23:23.733 --> 00:23:24.173
Right.

00:23:26.612 --> 00:23:29.532
I told the Power Supply Bureau
to restore production electricity first,

00:23:30.292 --> 00:23:31.736
and then the domestic electricity.

00:23:31.933 --> 00:23:32.812
Hurry back to Yuehai.

00:23:33.653 --> 00:23:35.013
Calm down the people's emotions.

00:23:36.893 --> 00:23:38.453
But you, Zheng Decheng.

00:23:39.292 --> 00:23:40.253
As the Secretary,

00:23:40.413 --> 00:23:42.653
you have indeed hurt
the cadres' feelings.

00:23:42.973 --> 00:23:43.612
Do you admit it?

00:23:43.852 --> 00:23:44.453
I admit it.

00:23:44.733 --> 00:23:46.132
I'm giving you a warning this time.

00:23:47.772 --> 00:23:48.173
Okay.

00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:50.013
Teach you a lesson.

00:23:50.372 --> 00:23:52.602
Remember to clarify the situation first

00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:54.052
- before deciding next time.
- I got it.

00:23:54.532 --> 00:23:55.064
Moreover,

00:23:55.384 --> 00:23:58.213
as Yuehai's leader,
you must take responsibility.

00:23:58.532 --> 00:23:59.893
Tomorrow morning at 9 AM,

00:24:00.253 --> 00:24:01.532
come to the county government.

00:24:01.772 --> 00:24:02.912
Apologize to all the cadres

00:24:03.192 --> 00:24:05.493
for the personal debt you owe.

00:24:07.413 --> 00:24:07.973
Okay.

00:24:10.213 --> 00:24:12.653
Mr. Zhao, I arranged for the cadres
to move to Yuehai

00:24:12.973 --> 00:24:14.292
to settle down initially.

00:24:14.733 --> 00:24:17.413
I am responsible for this
in the first place.

00:24:19.013 --> 00:24:19.973
If there's punishment

00:24:21.213 --> 00:24:24.052
or an apology required,
I'll bear it as well.

00:24:25.493 --> 00:24:26.933
Li, I haven't criticized you yet.

00:24:27.532 --> 00:24:28.612
You come to take the blame?

00:24:28.933 --> 00:24:30.493
Tell me, what was the task I gave you?

00:24:30.772 --> 00:24:32.413
It was when Zheng Decheng messes around,

00:24:32.493 --> 00:24:33.292
you hold him back.

00:24:34.413 --> 00:24:35.132
What now?

00:24:35.693 --> 00:24:37.332
You betrayed the trust placed in you.

00:24:40.213 --> 00:24:41.453
I'll get back to you later.

00:24:42.372 --> 00:24:43.413
In the town government,

00:24:44.013 --> 00:24:45.893
someone has to be responsible
for production.

00:24:46.253 --> 00:24:47.173
Get back immediately.

00:24:47.733 --> 00:24:48.733
Resume work.

00:24:49.612 --> 00:24:51.092
Ensure Yuehai operates normally.

00:24:52.052 --> 00:24:52.413
Okay.

00:24:52.572 --> 00:24:53.173
Okay.

00:25:05.532 --> 00:25:06.968
Zheng Decheng, where are you going?

00:25:07.893 --> 00:25:09.372
How dare you leave?

00:25:09.733 --> 00:25:11.893
Listen, you're not going anywhere today.

00:25:12.092 --> 00:25:13.132
You'll stay put here.

00:25:13.528 --> 00:25:14.322
(Conference Room)

00:25:14.332 --> 00:25:16.693
Think hard about how you'll face
the cadres tomorrow.

00:25:18.772 --> 00:25:19.864
Write an apology letter.

00:25:20.612 --> 00:25:23.132
Write what you truly think.
Show some sincerity.

00:25:23.612 --> 00:25:24.653
Do I make myself clear?

00:25:25.213 --> 00:25:25.973
Yes.

00:25:27.493 --> 00:25:28.253
Then go write it.

00:25:28.893 --> 00:25:29.332
Okay.

00:25:30.052 --> 00:25:30.532
Well...

00:25:32.653 --> 00:25:33.413
Make it profound.

00:25:33.933 --> 00:25:34.733
Yes, got it.

00:25:47.132 --> 00:25:47.772
Mr. Zhao,

00:25:49.532 --> 00:25:52.253
do you really want
Zheng Decheng to apologize?

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:56.493
This incident has already damaged

00:25:57.013 --> 00:25:58.092
his credibility.

00:25:58.772 --> 00:26:00.292
If he apologizes,

00:26:00.612 --> 00:26:02.092
will it escalate tensions?

00:26:02.812 --> 00:26:03.733
How about this?

00:26:04.292 --> 00:26:05.332
First, issue a notice

00:26:05.572 --> 00:26:07.532
to clarify the situation.

00:26:08.092 --> 00:26:11.013
Reprimand Zheng Decheng internally.

00:26:11.332 --> 00:26:12.933
Tone down the incident.

00:26:13.253 --> 00:26:14.973
How can we tone down this?

00:26:15.812 --> 00:26:18.532
Guan, the cadres are so furious.

00:26:18.852 --> 00:26:19.893
As county leaders,

00:26:20.213 --> 00:26:21.893
we must make Zheng Decheng step forward.

00:26:22.493 --> 00:26:24.973
He owes them
an explanation and accountability.

00:26:28.292 --> 00:26:30.253
This situation has escalated

00:26:30.413 --> 00:26:32.812
beyond what a simple notice can resolve.

00:26:33.493 --> 00:26:35.973
The cadres' frustrations must be vented.

00:26:36.693 --> 00:26:37.233
Otherwise,

00:26:37.784 --> 00:26:40.024
the pressure on the management
of Yuehai will be greater.

00:26:40.493 --> 00:26:42.168
The one who tied the bell must untie it.

00:26:42.612 --> 00:26:44.052
Why am I demanding his apology?

00:26:44.372 --> 00:26:46.493
To relieve his own burden first,

00:26:47.653 --> 00:26:49.332
teach him a lesson,

00:26:49.812 --> 00:26:52.812
and make him realize
the consequences of acting recklessly.

00:26:54.213 --> 00:26:54.733
Power's back!

00:26:57.612 --> 00:26:58.132
Power's back!

00:26:59.013 --> 00:26:59.693
Power's back!

00:27:04.213 --> 00:27:04.973
Hello, Ms. Li.

00:27:05.173 --> 00:27:05.893
Hello.

00:27:07.173 --> 00:27:07.973
Hello, Ms. Li.

00:27:08.092 --> 00:27:08.772
Hello, Ms. Li.

00:27:09.013 --> 00:27:09.653
Ms. Li.

00:27:10.292 --> 00:27:11.013
Coming, coming!

00:27:11.132 --> 00:27:11.812
Hello, Ms. Li.

00:27:11.933 --> 00:27:12.693
Hai!

00:27:13.453 --> 00:27:14.693
Hai! Hai!

00:27:14.733 --> 00:27:15.612
Mantis style!

00:27:16.013 --> 00:27:16.893
Qiang, Hai.

00:27:17.973 --> 00:27:18.532
Ms. Li.

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:28.852
Ms. Li.

00:27:29.493 --> 00:27:30.213
Ms. Li.

00:27:30.453 --> 00:27:31.092
Busy working?

00:27:33.173 --> 00:27:33.733
Ms. Li,

00:27:34.092 --> 00:27:34.532
hello.

00:27:34.612 --> 00:27:35.253
Hello.

00:27:36.933 --> 00:27:37.493
Ms. Li,

00:27:37.893 --> 00:27:38.532
have you eaten?

00:27:38.893 --> 00:27:39.772
Ms. Li, join us.

00:27:40.013 --> 00:27:40.893
No, thanks.

00:27:41.013 --> 00:27:41.852
You all go ahead.

00:27:41.933 --> 00:27:42.572
Okay.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.888
(Unite to Build
a Brighter Future for Yuehai)

00:27:45.173 --> 00:27:45.572
Foolish.

00:27:48.493 --> 00:27:49.493
How much did you earn?

00:27:53.852 --> 00:27:54.852
Just about

00:27:56.812 --> 00:27:57.332
six yuan.

00:28:03.292 --> 00:28:05.332
You think I'm an idiot, huh?

00:28:06.893 --> 00:28:08.973
Renting comic books for three months,

00:28:09.612 --> 00:28:10.653
you only made six yuan?

00:28:11.532 --> 00:28:13.572
I bet you made ten times that.

00:28:14.173 --> 00:28:16.052
No! I... I'm not lying.

00:28:16.052 --> 00:28:17.092
That's truly all I earned.

00:28:20.173 --> 00:28:22.332
Dad, don't go further.
There's nothing there.

00:28:22.653 --> 00:28:24.332
You told me not to come here...

00:28:30.693 --> 00:28:33.253
Why does this one look different?

00:28:35.453 --> 00:28:37.092
No, that... That one has insects.

00:28:37.372 --> 00:28:38.132
Insects?

00:28:39.653 --> 00:28:41.733
Let me see. Where are they?

00:28:50.493 --> 00:28:51.253
Quite a few.

00:28:52.572 --> 00:28:54.973
Smart to hide it in a tin box.

00:28:55.132 --> 00:28:56.132
Not as smart as you.

00:29:05.532 --> 00:29:07.092
Decheng, you startled me!

00:29:10.013 --> 00:29:12.493
Dapeng, why are you back so early?

00:29:15.332 --> 00:29:16.772
I thought no one was home.

00:29:18.253 --> 00:29:19.852
I forgot my keys.

00:29:20.532 --> 00:29:22.092
Do you always break in like this?

00:29:22.253 --> 00:29:24.332
Of course not!

00:29:24.933 --> 00:29:26.132
Just once or twice.

00:29:27.092 --> 00:29:27.852
Maybe three times.

00:29:28.532 --> 00:29:30.532
The kid is unruly.
The young one is no better.

00:29:31.132 --> 00:29:31.572
Hurry up!

00:29:32.292 --> 00:29:32.852
Go cook now!

00:29:33.213 --> 00:29:34.213
Stop bickering! I know.

00:29:34.213 --> 00:29:35.092
Honestly!

00:29:36.812 --> 00:29:37.213
What's up?

00:29:42.092 --> 00:29:42.973
No, this...

00:29:53.693 --> 00:29:55.893
Decheng, what are you looking for?

00:29:56.052 --> 00:29:56.693
Money.

00:29:57.052 --> 00:29:57.413
Money?

00:30:00.532 --> 00:30:02.253
Exactly like me when I was young.

00:30:02.893 --> 00:30:04.013
Even this gets inherited?

00:30:05.332 --> 00:30:06.693
You're definitely my son.

00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:09.812
Come on. Let's count it.

00:30:10.772 --> 00:30:11.693
How much is there?

00:30:12.013 --> 00:30:12.973
54 yuan and 62 fen.

00:30:14.733 --> 00:30:16.013
You remember it quite clearly.

00:30:16.653 --> 00:30:17.253
That's all?

00:30:17.532 --> 00:30:18.092
Nothing left.

00:30:18.413 --> 00:30:19.173
Is that the truth?

00:30:19.372 --> 00:30:20.292
Then I'll swear it.

00:30:24.532 --> 00:30:27.213
Earning money is secondary, but lying?
I won't tolerate that.

00:30:27.612 --> 00:30:28.733
Decheng! Decheng!

00:30:29.532 --> 00:30:30.453
You can scold your kid.

00:30:30.453 --> 00:30:31.612
But you can't hit him.

00:30:31.653 --> 00:30:35.132
It's my principle.
Or I can't explain it to my sister.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.816
(Dear county committee leaders,)

00:30:45.752 --> 00:30:47.544
(I was wrong.)

00:31:19.852 --> 00:31:22.040
Personally, I believe
there's only one path now.

00:31:22.328 --> 00:31:24.253
Return Binhai Road project
to save the Secretary.

00:31:24.413 --> 00:31:25.292
I think we can return.

00:31:25.572 --> 00:31:26.132
Exactly.

00:31:26.372 --> 00:31:27.256
It must be returned.

00:31:27.372 --> 00:31:27.812
Right.

00:31:27.893 --> 00:31:30.132
If Ms. Chang backs out,
we'll find other solutions.

00:31:30.173 --> 00:31:31.292
Can't we find someone else?

00:31:31.292 --> 00:31:32.013
Ms. Gao, you...

00:31:32.013 --> 00:31:32.893
Just stop talking.

00:31:33.493 --> 00:31:35.693
You know exactly
what happened here, don't you?

00:31:36.052 --> 00:31:37.413
Stop. Just reflect on ourselves.

00:31:37.893 --> 00:31:39.893
Right? We all understand.
Let's just reflect.

00:31:40.173 --> 00:31:41.693
It's already happened. Let's think

00:31:41.693 --> 00:31:43.372
about how we can help
the Secretary, right?

00:31:43.453 --> 00:31:44.453
Let's go to the county

00:31:44.733 --> 00:31:46.453
and support the Secretary tomorrow.

00:31:46.612 --> 00:31:47.453
I'll go with you.

00:31:47.653 --> 00:31:48.493
Why are you going?

00:31:48.852 --> 00:31:49.572
You shouldn't go!

00:31:49.572 --> 00:31:52.092
The Secretary ended
up like this for our sake.

00:31:52.253 --> 00:31:53.132
We can't abandon him!

00:31:53.132 --> 00:31:55.092
Exactly! What would it mean
if we didn't go?

00:31:55.092 --> 00:31:56.453
So what other options do we have?

00:31:56.973 --> 00:31:57.413
Right.

00:31:57.413 --> 00:31:58.292
We'll all go together.

00:31:58.413 --> 00:32:00.253
Hear that? They're very emotional.

00:32:01.292 --> 00:32:03.453
I originally wanted to make a decision.

00:32:03.733 --> 00:32:04.933
But I'm the deputy mayor.

00:32:06.493 --> 00:32:08.733
Then let them in. I'll talk to them.

00:32:08.973 --> 00:32:09.812
I will let them in.

00:32:12.092 --> 00:32:12.772
Stop arguing!

00:32:12.772 --> 00:32:13.973
Come in. Come on. Get inside.

00:32:14.332 --> 00:32:15.372
Ms. Li will speak.

00:32:15.372 --> 00:32:15.973
Come on.

00:32:16.052 --> 00:32:16.572
Let's go.

00:32:16.933 --> 00:32:17.453
Great!

00:32:18.253 --> 00:32:19.512
Listen, I'll remember you.

00:32:19.763 --> 00:32:20.893
Didn't you go search before?

00:32:20.893 --> 00:32:22.052
Enough. Get down to business.

00:32:22.052 --> 00:32:22.372
Ms. Li.

00:32:22.372 --> 00:32:22.933
Come on.

00:32:22.933 --> 00:32:23.493
Come here.

00:32:23.493 --> 00:32:23.896
Ms. Li.

00:32:23.896 --> 00:32:24.812
Find a spot to stand.

00:32:25.092 --> 00:32:25.893
Stand over there.

00:32:26.013 --> 00:32:26.893
Everyone, quiet now!

00:32:27.013 --> 00:32:28.132
Raise your hand to ask.

00:32:28.213 --> 00:32:28.772
Okay, okay.

00:32:29.173 --> 00:32:29.772
- Alright.
- Okay.

00:32:29.772 --> 00:32:30.973
Come on, Ms. Li. Please speak.

00:32:31.693 --> 00:32:32.532
I'll say a few words.

00:32:33.453 --> 00:32:34.092
Two things.

00:32:34.453 --> 00:32:36.472
First, tomorrow, no one

00:32:36.632 --> 00:32:37.973
goes to the county except me.

00:32:38.413 --> 00:32:38.893
Why?

00:32:38.893 --> 00:32:39.372
Wait.

00:32:39.372 --> 00:32:41.292
If all of you swarm down there,

00:32:41.493 --> 00:32:43.772
you'll put immense pressure
on county leaders.

00:32:44.413 --> 00:32:47.608
How could they make a decision?
Have you considered the consequences?

00:32:48.052 --> 00:32:48.893
What was I saying?

00:32:49.132 --> 00:32:50.493
Raise hands! Raise hands to speak.

00:32:51.372 --> 00:32:51.733
Don't...

00:32:51.733 --> 00:32:52.413
Okay, I...

00:32:52.532 --> 00:32:53.372
I think

00:32:53.693 --> 00:32:54.744
we should create

00:32:55.096 --> 00:32:56.733
some pressure for them, right?

00:32:56.733 --> 00:32:57.413
So we could...

00:32:57.532 --> 00:32:58.973
I mean, I should go with you.

00:33:00.493 --> 00:33:01.052
Good idea.

00:33:01.132 --> 00:33:02.372
No, absolutely not.

00:33:02.493 --> 00:33:03.052
Go on.

00:33:03.213 --> 00:33:05.253
I realize my suggestion also has issues.

00:33:05.772 --> 00:33:07.572
Mr. Zheng is fighting
on the front lines.

00:33:08.253 --> 00:33:10.372
We can't hold him back.

00:33:10.973 --> 00:33:12.024
We just got power back.

00:33:12.888 --> 00:33:14.372
There's still much work to be done.

00:33:15.253 --> 00:33:15.733
Right?

00:33:16.372 --> 00:33:18.413
Second, who said we needed
to return Binhai Road?

00:33:18.812 --> 00:33:19.893
- I did.
- We all said.

00:33:19.933 --> 00:33:20.733
Yeah, and me too.

00:33:21.812 --> 00:33:23.128
This isn't child's play.

00:33:23.544 --> 00:33:25.092
Binhai Road gets returned so easily?

00:33:25.292 --> 00:33:25.653
Then...

00:33:25.653 --> 00:33:28.052
Printing Street must
seize the market opportunity.

00:33:28.493 --> 00:33:29.933
We cannot back down on this road.

00:33:30.213 --> 00:33:32.056
Moreover, we should build it up

00:33:32.443 --> 00:33:33.253
as soon as possible.

00:33:35.292 --> 00:33:37.532
I know you all want to help Mr. Zheng.

00:33:37.973 --> 00:33:38.532
But

00:33:39.052 --> 00:33:40.173
since Mr. Zheng and I

00:33:40.213 --> 00:33:42.772
handed Binhai Road over to you,

00:33:43.532 --> 00:33:45.372
we had already anticipated
the worst outcome.

00:33:46.973 --> 00:33:48.612
Now Mr. Zheng alone

00:33:48.772 --> 00:33:50.332
bears all the responsibility.

00:33:51.733 --> 00:33:53.893
Before I returned, he instructed me

00:33:54.292 --> 00:33:55.332
to ensure production

00:33:55.933 --> 00:33:58.413
and also Yuehai's stable progress.

00:33:59.292 --> 00:34:01.092
We can't let him down.

00:34:02.052 --> 00:34:03.013
We... We got it.

00:34:03.733 --> 00:34:04.253
Yes, got it.

00:34:04.772 --> 00:34:06.733
Oh, right. And Xingfu Road too.

00:34:06.933 --> 00:34:07.572
Mr. Lin,

00:34:08.052 --> 00:34:10.813
under no circumstances should we
delay the construction schedule.

00:34:11.252 --> 00:34:12.652
Got it. I've got it under control.

00:34:13.893 --> 00:34:14.893
Well...

00:34:15.172 --> 00:34:16.773
Ms. Li, I have another question.

00:34:17.132 --> 00:34:17.933
Tomorrow,

00:34:18.132 --> 00:34:20.413
Mr. Zheng won't really
get dismissed, will he?

00:34:20.612 --> 00:34:21.092
Yeah.

00:34:21.252 --> 00:34:22.652
Will he actually be removed?

00:34:23.413 --> 00:34:25.572
- No way.
- I wanted to ask that too.

00:34:25.612 --> 00:34:27.212
- This is everyone's...
- Will he?

00:34:27.252 --> 00:34:27.960
He won't, right?

00:34:28.973 --> 00:34:29.652
Right.

00:34:30.493 --> 00:34:31.813
I trust Mr. Zheng.

00:34:32.453 --> 00:34:35.333
And I trust our leaders and cadres too.

00:34:36.732 --> 00:34:37.624
Get two dough sticks and head to work.

00:34:44.152 --> 00:34:45.413
Get them before going to work.

00:34:45.413 --> 00:34:46.853
Tie up yesterday's loose ends.

00:34:47.222 --> 00:34:47.612
Okay.

00:34:47.612 --> 00:34:48.853
Sir, what's wrong?

00:34:49.413 --> 00:34:51.252
Is something wrong
with the bun? Not tasty?

00:34:55.132 --> 00:34:55.532
No.

00:34:57.132 --> 00:34:58.973
Not sure why, but I have no appetite.

00:34:59.813 --> 00:35:00.532
Do you have tea?

00:35:00.973 --> 00:35:01.853
Yes.

00:35:11.132 --> 00:35:12.813
It's quite lively today.

00:35:13.652 --> 00:35:15.252
I heard some fool

00:35:15.773 --> 00:35:18.373
offended thousands
of cadres county-wide.

00:35:19.572 --> 00:35:22.092
So today, he's apologizing
to all county cadres.

00:35:24.293 --> 00:35:24.933
I know.

00:35:26.572 --> 00:35:27.773
That fool is me.

00:35:56.692 --> 00:35:57.413
What's going on?

00:35:58.052 --> 00:35:59.493
I didn't eat much this morning.

00:36:09.252 --> 00:36:09.933
Mr. Zheng.

00:36:11.853 --> 00:36:13.052
Is your apology letter ready?

00:36:16.773 --> 00:36:17.933
Of course not.

00:36:18.572 --> 00:36:20.252
I couldn't squeeze out a word all night.

00:36:20.893 --> 00:36:21.732
Why are you here?

00:36:24.052 --> 00:36:26.813
Ms. Li said you're not here
to apologize today.

00:36:27.052 --> 00:36:27.933
You're here to fight.

00:36:29.413 --> 00:36:31.172
Ms. Li was worried, so she brought me.

00:36:35.813 --> 00:36:36.692
How's the town?

00:36:37.413 --> 00:36:38.293
Is everyone okay?

00:36:38.572 --> 00:36:39.800
Don't worry, power's restored.

00:36:40.132 --> 00:36:41.652
Factories are back to production.

00:36:41.893 --> 00:36:44.172
Mr. Lin's Xingfu Road project
is proceeding normally.

00:36:44.572 --> 00:36:45.212
That's good.

00:36:46.973 --> 00:36:48.376
Tiger balm. It refreshes your mind.

00:36:48.568 --> 00:36:49.532
This should help you.

00:36:57.572 --> 00:36:59.453
Mr. Zheng, open your mouth.

00:37:01.092 --> 00:37:02.252
Wh... What is it?

00:37:02.453 --> 00:37:03.652
Licorice tablets for throat.

00:37:03.933 --> 00:37:04.373
I...

00:37:07.773 --> 00:37:08.973
You want me to swallow it dry?

00:37:21.453 --> 00:37:22.252
Open your mouth.

00:37:24.252 --> 00:37:24.893
What is it?

00:37:25.252 --> 00:37:26.172
Tranquilizing tablets.

00:37:27.453 --> 00:37:28.440
Tranquilizing tablets.

00:37:28.532 --> 00:37:30.333
They relieve tension and help you relax.

00:37:30.652 --> 00:37:32.984
Pure herbal ingredients,
without side effects. Don't worry.

00:37:34.172 --> 00:37:35.013
Swallow it.

00:37:44.092 --> 00:37:45.572
Mr. Zheng, take off your clothes.

00:37:45.773 --> 00:37:46.853
Are you crazy?

00:37:47.052 --> 00:37:48.013
We're in public!

00:37:48.413 --> 00:37:49.373
Don't be nervous.

00:37:49.773 --> 00:37:51.132
Enough! Who's nervous?

00:37:51.293 --> 00:37:53.172
I wasn't nervous
until you made me nervous.

00:37:53.373 --> 00:37:54.333
Stop. Let it be.

00:38:00.532 --> 00:38:01.172
Take this.

00:38:01.532 --> 00:38:02.652
Who takes this many?

00:38:02.732 --> 00:38:03.773
Are you refining elixirs?

00:38:03.853 --> 00:38:05.052
You've got me nervous too.

00:38:05.532 --> 00:38:06.893
Don't be nervous. It's fine.

00:38:07.773 --> 00:38:10.052
Take these
quick-acting heart relief pills.

00:38:10.252 --> 00:38:12.853
Take one if you feel short
of breath later

00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:14.200
- when you are on stage.
- Take this.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:14.933
This will help.

00:38:14.933 --> 00:38:15.933
Yes, take it.

00:38:21.453 --> 00:38:23.013
You can do it. You can.

00:38:23.453 --> 00:38:24.973
That scared me to death!

00:38:25.293 --> 00:38:26.813
It's fine. No problem.

00:38:50.252 --> 00:38:51.572
He has no sense of time.

00:38:51.933 --> 00:38:54.003
Today, all the cadres and their families

00:38:54.424 --> 00:38:55.252
are here.

00:38:55.373 --> 00:38:57.612
Let's see how Zheng Decheng
explains this to everyone.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.692
(Auditorium)

00:38:59.692 --> 00:39:00.333
Mr. Zheng,

00:39:01.453 --> 00:39:03.052
I knew you couldn't draft a speech.

00:39:03.493 --> 00:39:04.052
So

00:39:04.773 --> 00:39:06.853
when you don't know what to say,
just read this.

00:39:06.973 --> 00:39:07.893
It'll help.

00:39:12.692 --> 00:39:13.532
Das Kapital?

00:39:14.732 --> 00:39:15.453
Will it work?

00:39:16.413 --> 00:39:18.613
Mr. Zheng, Mr. Zhao is waiting
for you inside.

00:39:18.872 --> 00:39:19.453
Hurry up.

00:39:19.572 --> 00:39:20.052
Okay, okay.

00:39:20.212 --> 00:39:20.652
Hurry.

00:39:21.528 --> 00:39:23.000
(Auditorium)

00:39:23.612 --> 00:39:25.013
Make way.

00:39:26.532 --> 00:39:27.252
Make way.

00:39:27.252 --> 00:39:28.013
- He's here.
- Excuse me.

00:39:28.013 --> 00:39:28.612
Coming through.

00:39:29.612 --> 00:39:30.293
Let me through.

00:39:30.973 --> 00:39:31.893
You wait here for me.

00:39:32.052 --> 00:39:32.692
Alright.

00:39:39.172 --> 00:39:40.092
Let's see what he says.

00:39:58.453 --> 00:39:59.013
Everyone.

00:39:59.973 --> 00:40:02.413
Recently, the Yuehai Binhai Road issue

00:40:03.212 --> 00:40:04.472
has made Pingchuan County

00:40:04.472 --> 00:40:06.373
Committee Compound unsettled.

00:40:07.052 --> 00:40:08.172
Regarding the causes

00:40:08.252 --> 00:40:10.413
and consequences of this matter,

00:40:10.773 --> 00:40:13.052
let's invite Zheng Decheng,

00:40:13.293 --> 00:40:15.413
Secretary of Yuehai,
to report in detail.

00:40:18.413 --> 00:40:19.092
Make it good.

00:40:30.333 --> 00:40:32.853
Mr. Zheng is so pitiful. What can he do?

00:40:33.773 --> 00:40:35.333
My heart is pounding.

00:40:37.092 --> 00:40:38.212
(Meng was right.)

00:40:39.333 --> 00:40:40.933
(It's hard for us now to imagine)

00:40:41.692 --> 00:40:43.212
(in such an innocent era,)

00:40:44.132 --> 00:40:46.252
(how one person openly apologizing
to thousands)

00:40:46.612 --> 00:40:48.052
(must have felt.)

00:40:49.933 --> 00:40:51.532
(And most of them)

00:40:52.013 --> 00:40:54.652
(were cadres higher in rank
and position than himself.)

00:40:56.773 --> 00:40:58.104
(I'm not sure if Zheng Decheng)

00:40:58.456 --> 00:40:59.933
(could actually speak.)

00:41:28.373 --> 00:41:29.732
Zheng Decheng ran away.

00:41:29.732 --> 00:41:30.616
Why did he run away?

00:41:30.813 --> 00:41:32.333
- Why did Zheng Decheng run away?
- What's he doing?

00:41:37.692 --> 00:41:38.373
What's going on?

00:41:39.612 --> 00:41:40.572
Where did he go?

00:41:49.652 --> 00:41:50.212
Water.

00:41:54.853 --> 00:41:56.333
Slow down. Don't choke!

00:41:56.732 --> 00:41:57.813
Just take it all up.

00:42:30.453 --> 00:42:31.293
Hello, everyone.

00:42:32.732 --> 00:42:34.293
I am the man known as

00:42:34.893 --> 00:42:36.413
Pingchuan County's biggest fool,

00:42:37.293 --> 00:42:37.973
Zheng Decheng.

00:42:42.132 --> 00:42:42.853
You heard him?

00:42:43.052 --> 00:42:45.293
Mr. Zheng said he's
Pingchuan County's biggest fool.

00:42:46.493 --> 00:42:47.453
- First,
- I heard.

00:42:47.692 --> 00:42:49.612
I want to apologize

00:42:49.732 --> 00:42:51.896
to all cadres and families
who came to build

00:42:52.568 --> 00:42:53.172
in Yuehai.

00:42:53.773 --> 00:42:55.652
My personal mistake

00:42:56.732 --> 00:42:57.692
has caused you hardship.

00:42:59.373 --> 00:42:59.933
I'm sorry.
