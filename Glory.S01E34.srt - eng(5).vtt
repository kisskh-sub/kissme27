[Episode 34]

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.350
Master Jianglai.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.940
Huiqing refused to toast you.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.870
Let me give you a toast.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.460
Will you accept it?

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.789
You're the bold one.

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.430
Do you know

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.289
that Miss Rong by Jianglai's side

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.000
always has a whip with her?

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.920
I've heard that every Rong Family woman
is extremely jealous,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.980
and men fear her as if she were a tiger.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.200
I'm afraid Jianglai

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.720
won't dare to accept your toast.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.160
These are mere trifles,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.190
not worth your anger, Master Jianglai.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.310
Master Shuyu composed this music himself

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.360
and had someone bring out

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.750
this fine wine
that has been preserved for 10 years.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.079
He has long awaited
this reunion of brothers.

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.520
Do not spoil his mood.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.910
Please drink this up.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.079
You'll be close brothers again.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.590
Shuyu.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.490
I think you're truly drunk.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.120
You should rest early tonight.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.980
Whatever it is,

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.829
we can discuss it when you're sober.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.840
He is so cold.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.050
I did nothing to offend him,

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.390
yet he treated me
as if I were some filthy creature.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.800
Master Shuyu, what about this wine?

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.130
[Fuping Pavilion]

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.210
Uncle Jianglai.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.960
Uncle Jianglai!

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.890
Xun, why are you here?

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.290
Uncle Jianglai,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.560
you ate nothing

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.800
at the table just now.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.870
This is for you.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.880
Xun, this jujube cake is from you.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.279
I will definitely eat it.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.360
It's cold outside. Go back early.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.190
Lady Shanbao, why are you not waiting
in your chamber

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.390
for Lord Lu to return?

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.790
He specifically asked you to wait inside.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.430
My mind is in a whirl.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.320
I want to take a walk.

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.920
Xiu Qiong.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.560
Tonight,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.150
did you notice if he seemed very happy

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.680
when he left for the dinner?

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.630
Lord Lu lost his mother when he was young.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.680
His foster father was killed
by a powerful clan.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.040
Left all alone in the world
and with no one to rely on,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.370
he endured nothing but bullying
from his relatives

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.970
and cold stares from others.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.630
Against all odds, he passed
the imperial exam and became an official.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.310
He avenged his father,
brought corrupt officials to justice,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.600
and devoted himself to his duties.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.430
Now he has finally reunited
with his own elder brother.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.630
Of course he's happy.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.950
Yes,

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.390
he's happy.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.800
He's a reserved and reticent person.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.860
I've never seen him

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.070
show such obvious joy before.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.920
Lady Shanbao, what troubles you?

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.050
I hope I'm just overthinking.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.510
May heaven be kind

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.360
and let him

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.700
keep this joy a little longer.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.800
Lady Shanbao, your words sound odd.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.000
I don't quite follow.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.560
Here come the jujube paste cakes.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.890
The jujube paste cakes!

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.470
Be careful. It's hot!

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.040
It's so hot!

Mother.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.480
It burned my tongue.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.390
Let me see.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.800
No need to rush.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.560
Let me cool it off for you.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.159
Take your time.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.430
Is it good?

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.000
It's really good!

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.260
Mother, your cooking is always the best.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.720
Mother.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.520
Shuyu also likes jujube cakes.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.159
I learned that my mother back home

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:36.270
has been suffering
from her migraines again.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.870
I thought of how this distant marriage

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.600
keeps me from my filial duties.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.070
Miss Rong, I lost my composure

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.400
in front of you just now.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.230
Sorry you had to see that.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.270
Mrs. Xue.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.159
When I was only 13,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.400
my grandmother forced me
to escort tea shipments.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.750
I had no choice but to leave

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.560
my nanny and maids

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.220
who had cared for me for years.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.780
I cried my eyes out.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.450
The world collapsed around me.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.170
Darkness swallowed me whole.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.640
My will to live was gone.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.160
I still remember that year

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.520
we joined the autumn-winter caravan.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.560
It was over 3,000 kilometers,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.280
a journey that took 3 months.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.560
Along the way were grasslands, mountains,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.360
wild forests and desolate ruins.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.620
It felt like the journey would never end.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.750
Thank you, Miss Rong.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.940
Thanks for saving me
from further embarrassment

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.340
and even going out
of your way to comfort me.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.030
Actually,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Master Shuyu

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.680
wasn't always like this.

[Bogu Studio]

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.960
Let's go back now.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.390
Oh no!

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.580
My Lady, what should we do?

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.510
If we're caught

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.240
getting back late,

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:51.710
we'll never be

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.150
allowed to go out again.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.480
My master happened to see you
in a predicament.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.720
He specifically sent me
to bring you this umbrella

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.030
to help you out.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.440
Who is your master?

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.510
A kind act needs no name attached to it.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.170
Please just take it and use it.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.790
Thank you.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.870
He's a kind man

My Lady, let's hurry back.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:51.540

[Hengsheng]

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:55.630
I've always despised

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.600
those spoiled and ignorant

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.600
sons of nobility.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.720
So I deliberately stayed a year
at my maternal grandparents' home,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.120
refusing to return home.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.750
Later, my father
tested Master Shuyu's scholarship

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.960
and tricked me
into watching it from behind a screen.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.690
I recognized him immediately.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.680
It turned out
his courtesy name was Hengsheng.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.220
After I learned the whole story,

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.350
I thought he was truly my destined match

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.450
and the man of my dreams.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.810
I was filled with such joy.

Hengsheng… Hengsheng…

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.510
I thought it meant
brimming with wit and wisdom.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.770
But actually, it meant

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.320
that he was born
in an unusual breech position,

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.200
which rendered the labor

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.390
extremely perilous.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.000
That he bears such a name

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.720
is a testament to his rebellious

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.130
and defiant nature.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.020
How could I rely on him for a lifetime?

Someone's dead!

There's a dead man in the library!

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.860
Jianglai is...

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.310
It's not him.

It's so cold.

The maids screamed in terror

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.920
when they saw the body.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.650
I hope you weren't frightened.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.030
You never take

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.090
this jade ring off.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.780
The moment I saw it wasn't there,
I knew it could not be you.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.000
Master Jianglai,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.480
are you alright?

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.960
Thank goodness you're in one piece.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.150
Thank heavens!

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.200
This person

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.480
snuck into my room at night.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.240
Young Master!

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.310
Young Master!

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.000
With no way out,

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.190
he swallowed his silver needle

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.320
and died on the spot.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.000
Mrs. Xue, what's wrong?

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.470
It's nothing.

Miss Rong, unlike you,
who have weathered many storms,

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.480
I am just a woman
confined to the inner quarters.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.630
The sight of a corpse

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.200
startled me for a moment.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.690
The smell of blood is indeed strong,

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.340
making people dizzy.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.560
I have a vial of calming pills here.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.320
Mrs. Xue, please take one.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.910
It's excellent for settling your mind.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:10.630
Thank you.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:23.190
Son of a bitch!

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.860
This scoundrel somehow

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.840
changed into a guard's uniform

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.080
and snuck into the mansion
to carry out the assassination.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.140
Truly despicable!

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.960
Thankfully, Master Jianglai
was blessed by the gods

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.360
and thus spared from harm.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.120
I'll go right away

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.240
to report this to the Duke!

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.510
We'll conduct a thorough search
of the Duke's Mansion tonight

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.440
and find the assassin's accomplices!

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.120
Do you really think his accomplices
would just linger here

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.780
waiting to be arrested by you?

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.200
Yes.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.000
It's late.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.430
No need to make a fuss.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.480
No need to disturb

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.630
the Duke and Master Shuyu.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.140
Gather all the gatekeepers
and patrol guards.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.270
Carry the body over there

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:51.480
and ask them to identify it.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.610
Then send two men to keep watch over it.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.850
Tomorrow I'll send for a coroner
to examine the corpse.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.120
Master Jianglai,

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.200
you're truly thoughtful.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.120
But after tonight's fight,

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.390
this chamber is hardly fit

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.440
for habitation anymore.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.670
I'll immediately ask others

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.390
to get another room prepared for you.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.790
That won't be necessary.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:06.750
Tonight,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.610
I'll make do with the study.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.790
Huiqing, you were frightened

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.190
and should go rest early.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.240
Steward Xue,

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.030
please escort Huiqing back personally.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.630
Yes.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:20.680
Young Madam, please.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.130
I'll wait for you in the study.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.640
I have questions for you.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:42.360
Take it away.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.830
Bao.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.630
I was just kicked

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.630
by that assassin.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.210
It seems the blow struck deep inside.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.670
I didn't feel a thing then,

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.130
but now it suddenly hurts.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.890
I can't bear it anymore, Bao.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.490
I need to lie down for a while.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:18.550
Bao,

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.030
don't you care about me at all?

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.200
I'm in such pain.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.270
Come take a look.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.770
Is it swollen from the kick?

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.880
Look. Is it right here?

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.870
Bao, how heartless you are!

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.240
If you put on such an act
to dodge my questions,

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.640
then we're done talking.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:57.550
Bao.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:02.080
Don't push me like this.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.270
Lu Jianglai, you dare not say it.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.950
Fine, I'll say it for you.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.200
Who hosted the feast you attended today?

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.960
What did you eat and drink there?

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.290
Someone wants you dead.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.750
Are you truly unaware?

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.109
Or are you just playing dumb?

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:17.310
You elder brother, Master Shuyu...

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.200
Say no more.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.270
You know everything perfectly well.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.930
Why keep deceiving yourself?

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:27.920
Before I met you,

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.310
I was cold-hearted and arrogant.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.200
Confronted by all the villains
in the world,

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.060
I struck them down without mercy.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.580
So many corrupt officials at court

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.110
hated me and wanted me dead,

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.750
but I never flinched.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.510
A person who is all alone

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:46.640
has nothing to fear.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.240
But just now,

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:51.920
I was truly afraid.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.620
For the first time in my life,
I felt fear.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:58.680
What were you afraid of?

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.290
I was afraid that one day,

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.850
I would also become just a cold name

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.160
in those case files.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.270
I was even more afraid

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:13.830
that my elder brother

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:16.830
was behind all this.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.830
Bao, do you know what he did?

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.110
He made little Xun

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.680
bring me that jujube cake

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.000
laced with sedatives.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.680
To reassure me,

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:30.640
he even put on a show
of humiliating his wife

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.830
and disciplining his son in front of me.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.070
He is my only

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.440
blood brother

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.640
in this whole world.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.790
But he wants me dead.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.590
Bao.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.590
He wants me dead.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.640
I see.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.260
You didn't eat that piece of jujube cake.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.200
Well done.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.000
I kept that piece of jujube cake,

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.450
because I wanted to tell you

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.590
that you were worrying too much,

00:18:58.790 --> 00:18:59.920
that my brother

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.120
was as kind-hearted as my mother,

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.660
that he valued the bond
between us siblings,

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.920
and that he was not as vile
as you thought.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.440
But in the end...

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:10.270
In the end,

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.570
I, Lu Jianglai, am fated to be all alone

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.310
and cut off from all kin.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:21.710
No one in this world loves me.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.410
No one in this world will ever love me.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.680
But I'm here, aren't I?

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.550
You're not all alone.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:44.880
Then, will you

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.110
by my side forever?

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:57.400
Rong Shanbao!

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.050
Do you have another lover?

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.340
Why are you so hesitant and evasive

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.270
every time

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.030
I ask you?

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:05.640
What are you hiding from me?

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.840
Of course...

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.930
Of course...

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.200
This is exactly the tradition
of your Rong family.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.680
The moment I'm not by your side,

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.400
someone will immediately

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.240
take my place!

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.730
Even if you're unwilling,

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.110
your grandmother, your sisters,

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.640
and those

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.440
foolish men with ill intentions

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.200
will all try

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.330
to deceive you with their sweet words.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.350
Who is it?

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.500
Is it Cheng Guanyu?

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.210
Or is it your cousin Wen Can?

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.640
Who the hell is it, Bao?

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:43.440
Who the hell is it?

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.550
Or which stranger is it?

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.350
Tell me!

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:46.350
Who the hell is it?

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.170
I don't have another lover.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:50.690
Then promise me

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.240
that if you do,

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:53.750
you must tell me.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.470
And what if I tell you?

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.640
Then I will stuff

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.590
that despicable thief

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:00.850
back into his rat hole.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.600
And then I will hide you

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.720
in a place no one

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.850
but me can ever find.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.400
Unless you swear

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.640
that you'll never leave me again

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.170

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:23.070

♪ How many scrolls of poetry

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:24.980

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:48.200
The guards in the mansion

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.200
all claim they've never seen this person.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.200
I've ordered people
to search the entire mansion.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.440
I believe we'll get to the bottom of this
soon.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.640
Your Highness, I hope

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.110
you can grant me three more days.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.110
You just said

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.270
Jianglai had forbidden
anyone in the mansion to look into this

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.240
and intended to bring in outside help,
right?

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:04.830
Yes.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.470
So, he suspects there's an accomplice
hidden in the mansion.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.570
The fact that an assassin could sneak in
so easily

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.100
proves you're all nothing
but useless fools!

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.960
Yes.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.920
The guards on patrol duty last night

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.520
will each receive 30 lashes.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:19.270
Yes.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:20.590
Including you!

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.480
Yes.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.200
Get out!

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:24.720
Yes.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.590
Xun.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.040
Come over to me.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.240
Grandfather.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.030
I've finished all the homework

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.420
you assigned me.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:47.530
Really? Let me have a look.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:52.030
Well done. Quite impressive.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.350
Your Highness, I heard from Xun

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.310
that you've been troubled lately.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.790
I assume it's because

00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:59.750
you're concerned about Jianglai's matter.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.350
I've made some Fuling cakes.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.350
The doctor says
they can strengthen the vital energy,

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:04.270
calm the spirit,

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.830
and even promote longevity.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.030
This is the perfect season to have them.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.590
You're thoughtful.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.170
Leave them here.

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:12.220
Yes.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.390
Xun.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:23.510
Want some?

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:28.890
Here you are.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.460
Xun, you eat one first.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.000
Thank you, Grandfather.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.590
No.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.270
He hit you again?

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.270
No.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.550
I hurt myself

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.550
by accident.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.350
It had nothing to do with him.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.150
-What a scoundrel!
-Mother!

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.170
It's all right.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.400
Xun, don't be afraid.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.080
I'm not talking about you.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.000
Grandfather, please eat it.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.780
You'll feel better after eating it.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:05.910
The Fuling cake tastes much better
than the jujube cake.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.570
The jujube cake?

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.360
Father told me to send it
to Uncle Jianglai.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.040
What happened to your manners?

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.880
Before your grandfather,
you must observe the strictest etiquette.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.790
Do not speak recklessly of matters

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:20.650
your elders have not asked about.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.380
Your Highness, Xun has been suffering
from indigestion.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.510
He shouldn't eat too many pastries.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:25.770
I'll take him back now.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.480
Wait.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.920
Xun, come over here.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:42.530
You just said your father

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.490
told you to send a jujube cake
to your Uncle Jianglai.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.720
[Harmonious Radiance]

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.550
Mr. Lang, this way, please.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.120
You're walking so slowly.
It's driving me crazy!

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:09.920
Hurry up!

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.070
Shanbao chose to remain
at the Duke's Mansion.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.530
She must have her reasons.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.000
You

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.640
rushed over in such a panic

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.070
only because of the mission
Grandmother gave you.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.070
Grandmother carefully selected

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.880
these men for Shanbao.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.800
You already have Mr. Bai by your side.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.260
Don't even think about it.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.640
Grandmother said she was done meddling,

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.680
yet only a few days later,

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.270
she's already worrying again.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.960
As long as Shanbao
doesn't neglect her duties,

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.820
what does it matter who she likes?

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.480
I wouldn't put it that way.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.440
Lu Jianglai is about
to be formally recognized

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.440
as the Duke's son.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.400
Soon, he'll be matched with some
noble lady from a prominent family.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.930
Shanbao can't fall behind.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.880
This time,

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.030
Grandmother personally selected
more than 10 candidates,

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.310
each rivaling him
in both appearance and talent.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.240
Not just the families from Jiangnan
are eager to make a move.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:49.750
Even Cousin Wen

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.680
has sent two letters to ask about it.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.580
This is the Duke of Yongguo's Mansion.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.310
Lu Jianglai isn't someone to mess with.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:56.160
I advise you

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.240
to put away this precious booklet at once.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.900
Otherwise, if he finds out...

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.550
How about

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.480
I take a look for Shanbao
and see which one stands out?

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.400
Hurry! Hide it away!

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:22.550
Excuse me,

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.480
could you please return my ball?

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.310
This little girl
has such beautiful features.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.400
So pretty.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.790
What's your name?

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.880
Why are you playing here alone?

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.880
My name is Xuanyu.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.110
I'm not alone.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.000
I'm with...

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.650
Lady Xuanyu!

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.410
Lady Xuanyu!

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.880
Lady Xuanyu,

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.240
I just went back to fetch something,

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.030
and in the blink of an eye, you ran off.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:55.760
Madam Chang will be worried
if she can't find you.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.010
Let's go.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.960
If only I had

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.880
such a clever and adorable daughter.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.350
I should keep

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.350
one man from the booklet for myself.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.170
What are you looking at?

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.670
Nothing. Let's go.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.820
When did those outsiders arrive
at the mansion?

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.560
Find out and report back.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.200
Yes.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:35.480
The coroner retrieved

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.400
the silver needle that the deceased

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.270
had swallowed.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.300
Since the pathways within the head

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.240
are all linked, even a needle this fine,

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.880
when driven
with precisely calculated force,

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.720
could pierce through the ear canal
into the brain,

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.310
causing instant death.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.310
Afterwards, the needle could

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.970
be pulled out without a trace.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:51.410
Even after the coroner's examination,

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:53.130
no evidence would be found.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:55.350
Judging

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.680
from how the assassin committed suicide,

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.680
he was clearly very professional.

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:01.980
A highly paid assassin?

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.920
Who have you offended, My Lord?

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.830
They even dared to break
into the Duke's Mansion to kill you.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.030
I'll be more careful.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.210
Thank you for your help.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.510
My Lord, since you've asked me
to be your helper,

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.110
why won't you speak plainly?

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:18.270
Is there

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.350
anything you can't bring yourself to say?

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:22.000
I...

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.710
My Lord, Mrs. Xue is here.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.640
Let her in.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.510
Jianglai, I've come unbidden
to beg for your help.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:40.510
Please, don't say that.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.570
You can just tell me what's happened.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.200
Your brother

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.890
has been taken away by the Duke's men.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.200
I beg you to put aside past grievances

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.200
and save his life.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:48.920
Save his life?

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.240
The Duke truly has sharp eyes

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.710
and sees through every ruse.

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:58.880
He knows

00:29:59.160 --> 00:29:59.920
everything

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.400
you've done.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.350
I advise you to admit your fault

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.360
and beg for forgiveness.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.010
Father, I am foolish

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.640
and don't know what I've done wrong.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.590
Father, I beg you to tell me my fault.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.030
You asked Xun to send the jujube cake,
didn't you?

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.640
Yes, I asked him to send it.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.640
Someone laced the jujube cake
with sleeping draughts,

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.640
which were enough
to make a person unconscious.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.830
Do you know that your brother

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.550
was attacked by assassins last night?

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:27.960
I...

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:30.160
I knew nothing about it.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:30.920
Fine.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.920
Then the beating will continue,

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:36.210
until you admit what you know!

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.850
Father, you suspect

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.050
I'm the one who wants
to kill Jianglai?

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.110
Other than you,

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.280
who else hates him so deeply?

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:55.070
From the very day I brought

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.670
Jianglai into this mansion,

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.720
you've been guarding against him,
sowing discord between us,

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.920
and trying every means to drive him out!

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:02.770
His servant

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.240
managed to get out of the mansion
and send word outside.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.300
Wasn't it you who pulled the strings?

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.400
I simply didn't bother

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.240
to expose such petty tricks.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.200
I am a cripple,

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.790
who cannot uphold the Xue family's name.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.400
Everyone in the mansion knows

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.640
that you brought him back

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.720
to replace me!

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.620
So it's only natural
that I was wary of him

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:24.960
and kept my distance!

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:26.810
Is that such a grave crime?

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.000
But I never sent anyone to kill him.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:29.830
Never!

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:31.830
I can swear to God!

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.560
You still dare to deny it?

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.750
You're mediocre yourself,

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:40.620
yet you're jealous of those with talent.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:41.950
You even want to harm

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:42.790
your own brother.

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:44.190
You're truly monstrous!

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:46.730
I'll give you one last chance.

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:48.950
If you did it, admit it.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.100
Be a man
and take responsibility for your deeds!

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.050
It wasn't me!

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:56.730
I plead not guilty!

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.030
I never thought

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:07.790
that jealousy could breed

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:09.200
such a beastly heart

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.960
in my own son,

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.880
driving him to commit this inhumane crime.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.280
Take him away!

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.200
Cleanse his wicked heart with water!

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.940
Master Shuyu, forgive me.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:33.510
Father!

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.790
I didn't do it!

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.310
I never sent anyone
to assassinate my brother!

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:39.440
Someone was deliberately framing me!

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.480
Father, don't be deceived by them!

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:42.400
Father!

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.000
Look at this Mr. Ye.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.440
He is handsome and well-educated.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.310
His looks can rival those of the paragons
of male beauty.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:54.270
It is said that every time he goes out,

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:55.870
he attracts crowds of women,

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.300
his carriage filled
with gifts from admirers.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.960
He also comes from an esteemed family,

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.200
proud and arrogant.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:01.340
He's determined

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:03.350
to marry a noble lady
of both beauty and talent.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.880
Girls from ordinary families
could never hope to match him.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.710
I'm discussing important matters
with Yunshu.

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:08.710
Do not disrupt us.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:11.830
I'm here

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.200
on Grandmother's orders.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.830
How is that disrupting anything?

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:15.890
Take another look.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:19.070
If you don't like this one,
you can choose another.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.260
Xiu Qiong,
you should have spoken up earlier.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:30.880
I thought

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.880
it was that jealous man coming over.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.200
Lady Shanbao.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.750
The Duke is interrogating Master Shuyu.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.880
Lord Lu has rushed over to Baoshi Hall.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.770
Lord Lu is facing a difficult matter,

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:49.030
and you won't help him?

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.960
Whether it's difficult, domestic, joyous

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:54.590
or disastrous

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.760
all depends on his decision.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:58.950
Others can't help him.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.210
In the end,
he must make the decision himself.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.270
Yunshu, I have to trouble you

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.409
to look into someone for me.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:37.389
I really didn't do it.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:38.550
I really didn't.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.330
I really didn't.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.969
It's freezing cold!

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:54.050
You've finally come to see me.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:56.360
This damn wretch

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.440
dared to plot to kill his own brother.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:00.360
I am seeking justice for you.

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:02.450
You need not stop them.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:03.960
Even if he were

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.290
truly guilty of murder,

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.670
you couldn't just take the law
into your own hands.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:08.360
As for me,

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.940
I don't need you to seek justice for me.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:13.030
You're unworthy.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.030
How dare you!

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.260
Your Highness, be careful!

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.560
I truly did not misjudge you.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.540
Our Xue family finally has a worthy heir.

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:24.360
Bring Xun out!

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:25.400
Yes.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.510
Look.

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:35.320
Even your own son

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:37.080
isn't willing to plead for you.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:38.710
What a pathetic failure

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.230
you are as a father!

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:44.150
Jianglai, this is your own nephew.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.400
When you inherit my title,

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.850
you must treat him and his mother well.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:49.880
As for your

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.480
good-for-nothing brother,

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.760
he shall be exiled to a monastery
to live in seclusion

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.290
and atone for his sins
for the rest of his life.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.490
How do you know I am capable
of shouldering the responsibility?

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:04.370
I have kept a close eye on you
for quite some time.

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.300
What you've done in Linjin

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.280
shows that you're resolute

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.320
and decisive.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.230
You are the spitting image

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.400
of my younger self!

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.000
How could I possibly be mistaken?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.590
Fine.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.100
You asked me to treat Xun well.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.680
But when Xun grows up

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.760
and asks me

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.220
why I seized his father's title

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.940
and drove his father out
of the Xue family,

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.270
how should I answer him?

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:32.060
Shuyu is willing to step aside.

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:33.860
You didn't seize anything.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.910
Everything in this household

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:36.160
will be given to you by me.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.690
Who dares to question that?

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.630
Jianglai, what I want is a wolf.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.690
I want a leader wolf
that can command the pack.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.760
Everything I earned on the battlefield

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.440
can only be given to someone

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.570
who will bring glory to our Xue family.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:51.070
Xun is too young,

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.360
but you are in your prime!

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:59.000
So your plan is
that I replace my elder brother,

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.340
and my nephew succeeds me.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.050
But what if I have children
of my own in the future

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:05.850
and refuse to give the title to Xun?

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.730
Power and titles

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.630
only breed more hatred

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.210
and agony,

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.260
just like they did to you.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.280
You already had

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.550
a beloved wife,

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:16.990
yet to get more heirs,

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.770
you took one concubine after another.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.850
You brought them into this household,

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:23.850
but you did nothing
to stop your wife's jealousy,

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.390
standing by as they were bullied!

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:27.000
You drove my mother
into a life of wandering,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.880
leaving her with no one to rely on.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.740
You made me suffer
all the hardships of the world

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.800
and endure the cold stares of others!

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.930
They all said I was a servant's son.

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:35.250
But so what?

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.690
The lowborn servant

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.850
was willing to take my mother and me in.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.660
He spent everything he had

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:42.630
supporting my education.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:43.940
His moral character

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.000
was a thousand times nobler than yours.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.800
What did you say?

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.080
I said you're selfish!

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:54.300
You imprisoned me in your mansion,

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.630
not because you missed

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:56.800
your long-lost son.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.730
You never cared how much I had suffered

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:01.530
or what hardships I had endured.

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:03.300
You really think

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.950
that I would be grateful and overjoyed

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:06.310
when offered

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.540
this title?

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:09.920
You didn't even bother to ask

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:12.780
when my mother passed away,

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:14.040
or where she was buried!

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.040
You don't deserve to be her husband!

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:17.890
Your actions

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.440
have made my own brother fear me.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.370
He fears
that I will usurp his noble title.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.120
He even fears
that I'll drive him to his death.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.120
He's my brother.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.950
He and I share the same mother!

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.180
Yet you are

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:36.810
forcing us to turn against each other

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:37.880
with your own hands!

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.520
You

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.690
don't deserve to be our father!

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:57.840
I was fighting battles on the front lines.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:59.440
How could I have cared

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.440
about my women's petty jealousies?

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.210
It pains me deeply
that you and your mother

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:06.060
were driven out of the mansion.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.880
As for your brother,

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:11.920
his jealousy toward you

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.120
stems from his own narrow-mindedness.

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:15.690
Do you understand?

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.030
Shuyu.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.440
Let's go.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:48.800
Hate me if you must.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.980
But if you give up everything

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.880
in the Duke's Mansion just out of hatred,

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.880
then you'll truly be

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.630
the biggest fool in the world!

00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.810
Your Highness, this...

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.440
A man who has lost all hope

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.040
wouldn't argue so fiercely.

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.580
He cares about his brother

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.330
and even more about his nephew.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:10.800
In the end,

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.280
he will lower

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.150
his proud head in front of me.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.360
Here.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.220
Hurry! Bring the brazier!

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.350
The brazier! Hurry!

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:46.880
Are you feeling better?

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:18.760
Master Shuyu,

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.070
I heard you had caught a cold,

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.030
so I specially prepared some ginger soup
for you.

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:26.690
Drink it while it's hot.
It'll ward off the cold.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:35.110
You...

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.210
Get out.

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:40.000
Master Shuyu,

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.000
why is your face deathly pale?

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.200
It's so frightening.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.840
Why not let me

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:45.960
stay here and attend to you?

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.550
Get out!

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.440
Yes, Master Shuyu.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:54.880
Do drink the soup while it's still hot.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.320
It won't be effective if it turns cold.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.120
And all my effort will be wasted.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.100
Let me do it.

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:05.590
When I was little,

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.130
Mother used to comb my hair.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.490
It's a pity
that I didn't understand back then

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.120
why she always made two portions

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:17.340
of jujube cakes every time.

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:20.030
She would often stare at me blankly.

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.350
I only realized later

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:24.660
that Mother

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.400
was missing her other son.

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:31.560
Before Mother passed away,

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.890
she held my hand tightly,
refusing to close her eyes.

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:37.420
She was unwilling to go.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:43.360
She couldn't accept that before she died,

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.540
she never got to see you one last time.

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.750
All right.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.800
So, Shuyu, you don't need to worry.

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:12.550
I will never fight you for anything.

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:16.570
You don't want to fight me,

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.670
but I did think about killing you.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.640
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:24.920
I hesitated.

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:27.050
Jianglai, believe me.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.490
I never sent anyone to kill you.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.230
If I really had done it,

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:33.860
may I be pierced by a thousand arrows

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.260
and die a horrible death.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:42.100
All right. I see.

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:44.700
Don't be distressed.

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:49.190
It's getting late.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.640
Shuyu, get some rest.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.760
I'll come to see you another day.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:56.500
Jianglai!

00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:00.400
I know you don't believe me.

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.590
But

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:05.870
could you tell me more about her?

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.870
[Two ways to pronounce the words for tea
in different languages]

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:51.990
Bao.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:53.880
I was just kicked

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:54.900
by that assassin.

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.400
It seems the blow struck deep inside.

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.860
I didn't feel a thing then,

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:01.310
but now it suddenly hurts.

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:03.080
I can't bear it anymore, Bao.

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:04.680
I need to lie down for a while.

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:07.960
Bao,

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.200
don't you care about me at all?

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:12.670
I'm in such pain.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.590
Come take a look.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.970
Is it swollen from the kick?

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:22.450
[The language of tea knows no borders]

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:24.400
With the global expansion
of the tea trade,

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.190
the development of tea culture

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:26.840
has also swept the world.

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:28.190
As many people know,

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:30.150
in different languages around the world,

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:31.670
with a few exceptions,

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:32.590
there are only two ways

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:34.320
to pronounce the words for tea:

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.930
"cha" or "tea."

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.200
For instance, it's "cha"

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:39.490
in Russian and Korean,

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.930
while it's "tea"

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:42.930
in French and Spanish.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.130
Why does tea from China

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.190
have two different pronunciations?

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:48.320
This is mainly

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:49.550
because Chinese tea

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:50.920
was introduced to overseas regions

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:51.920
in different ways.

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:52.760
The regions

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.880
that imported tea from nothern China
via the Land Silk Road

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.480
or through tributary trade

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:57.360
were more likely

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.030
to have interactions with
northern China.

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:01.030
Most areas in northern China

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:02.250
refer to tea as "cha."

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.100
As a result,

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:05.150
the regions that obtained tea

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.840
via the Land Silk Road

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.230
and tributary trade

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.800
almost all adopted
the pronunciation of "cha"

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.260
or a similar variant of it.

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:12.510
As the Maritime Silk Road

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:13.710
rose to prominence,

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:14.660
large quantities of tea

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:16.150
were shipped out
from the Port of Quanzhou,

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:18.680
bringing the pronunciation of "tea"

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:20.310
in Hokkien to the world.
