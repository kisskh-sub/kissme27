Xie.

(Yuehai's Little Wall Street)
Have you read the Yuehai Column

00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:47.434
in "New City Life"?

00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:48.354
It mentions you.

00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:49.315
No time

00:01:49.714 --> 00:01:51.115
for tea, newspapers, or idle chat.

00:01:51.475 --> 00:01:53.835
It's important to read newspapers.

00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:56.595
I think the choice of words
and phrasing is really good,

00:01:56.794 --> 00:01:58.154
especially the last sentence.

00:01:58.874 --> 00:02:00.675
"Ms. Gao said

00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:05.315
her achievements wouldn't be possible
without her husband's understanding."

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:14.554
Angry now?

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:16.875
Men should be more magnanimous.

00:02:17.315 --> 00:02:20.074
Men can also be behind the scenes.
Don't you think so?

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:49.875
(Yuehai Column:
Yuehai's Little Wall Street)

00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:50.875
One, two.

00:02:51.195 --> 00:02:52.354
One, two.

00:02:53.114 --> 00:02:53.834
Here!

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:55.074
The road roller.

00:02:55.755 --> 00:02:56.315
Everyone,

00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:57.074
thank you all.

00:02:57.144 --> 00:02:57.834
Take a look!

00:02:59.514 --> 00:03:00.234
Come on, sir.

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:01.475
Mr. Lin.

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:03.915
I've brought people
to fix the road roller.

00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:04.954
It'll be fixed soon.

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:05.954
Ms. Li.

00:03:10.954 --> 00:03:11.954
Ms. Li, thank you.

00:03:12.674 --> 00:03:14.435
You're welcome. It'll be fixed soon.

00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:16.995
Let me do it.

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:18.915
It's fine. Give it to me.

00:03:19.634 --> 00:03:20.435
Don't worry.

00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:22.255
Ms. Li.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:22.995
It's fine.

00:03:23.315 --> 00:03:24.234
Wait.

00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:25.755
It's not your job.

00:03:25.995 --> 00:03:27.155
I need to talk to you.

00:03:27.554 --> 00:03:28.755
I met Sun Xiaoyan.

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:33.514
Come on.

00:03:33.674 --> 00:03:35.315
Why are you all standing? Get to work!

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:46.435
Ms. Li, I didn't...

00:03:47.755 --> 00:03:50.514
Towards her, I...

00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:52.155
She's a woman with a hard life,

00:03:52.755 --> 00:03:54.035
supporting a four-year-old child

00:03:54.354 --> 00:03:55.875
and a 50-something-year-old mother.

00:03:56.074 --> 00:03:57.595
The whole family depends on her alone.

00:03:58.234 --> 00:03:58.995
It's very hard.

00:03:59.634 --> 00:04:01.674
I also asked her what she thinks of you.

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:03.435
She said...

00:04:07.354 --> 00:04:08.875
Mr. Lin, pull harder!

00:04:12.954 --> 00:04:13.554
Mr. Lin.

00:04:13.794 --> 00:04:16.035
She said you have good character.

00:04:16.515 --> 00:04:19.314
You're capable and loyal.

00:04:19.754 --> 00:04:20.915
But you're not talkative.

00:04:21.754 --> 00:04:24.554
Of course,
not all women like sweet talk.

00:04:25.155 --> 00:04:28.075
Sometimes,
actions speak louder than words.

00:04:29.874 --> 00:04:30.715
In matters like this,

00:04:31.234 --> 00:04:33.475
shouldn't the man be more proactive?

00:04:34.275 --> 00:04:34.775
Right?

00:04:35.874 --> 00:04:38.234
Yes, you're right.

00:04:45.874 --> 00:04:47.955
Since you came to me about this,

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:50.114
I'll definitely find you a spot.

00:04:50.994 --> 00:04:53.035
Don't dry grain
in the sports field again, okay?

00:04:53.314 --> 00:04:57.475
But near my home,
that is the only flat place.

00:04:58.275 --> 00:05:00.194
No drying, no food.

00:05:00.434 --> 00:05:03.194
The grain will get moldy.

00:05:03.475 --> 00:05:04.515
That's not what I meant.

00:05:04.955 --> 00:05:06.794
I'm not telling you to go without food.

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:08.754
I bear you no grudge.

00:05:08.754 --> 00:05:10.354
Why would I make you go hungry?

00:05:10.354 --> 00:05:11.915
- I'm not stopping you.
- Mr. Xie.

00:05:11.915 --> 00:05:12.415
- Right?
- Mr. Xie.

00:05:12.874 --> 00:05:14.035
- Mr. Xie.
- Okay?

00:05:14.035 --> 00:05:14.635
It's fine.

00:05:14.635 --> 00:05:15.554
- Stop!
- Calm down!

00:05:15.554 --> 00:05:16.595
Your heart isn't good.

00:05:16.595 --> 00:05:18.434
Zhao from the Power Supply Bureau
is here.

00:05:18.674 --> 00:05:19.554
Tell him to wait.

00:05:19.674 --> 00:05:20.174
Just wait.

00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:22.194
He is leaving. I can't stop him.

00:05:22.354 --> 00:05:23.595
Alright.

00:05:24.754 --> 00:05:25.674
I'll be right back.

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:32.994
What's wrong, Mr. Xie?

00:05:33.554 --> 00:05:34.354
Stay longer.

00:05:34.794 --> 00:05:36.794
But I've finished my work here.

00:05:38.194 --> 00:05:39.395
Is everything fine?

00:05:39.874 --> 00:05:41.314
Sure, everything seems good.

00:05:41.434 --> 00:05:42.075
No problems?

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:42.874
None.

00:05:42.994 --> 00:05:43.955
I posed a problem

00:05:43.994 --> 00:05:45.794
about installing new power poles,
remember?

00:05:48.395 --> 00:05:50.354
It's been a month for the process.

00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:52.035
Not finished yet?

00:05:52.354 --> 00:05:55.275
Give me a rough date,
so I can explain to the people.

00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:57.354
Mr. Xie, it's not just the process.

00:05:57.994 --> 00:05:59.694
Give me more time
to think about it, okay?

00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:08.515
Wait, the lock isn't broken.

00:06:11.635 --> 00:06:13.955
I know what you meant.
You won't do what should be done.

00:06:14.314 --> 00:06:16.075
It's evasion, shirking responsibility.

00:06:16.754 --> 00:06:17.835
Think about it right here.

00:06:18.155 --> 00:06:18.655
Come on.

00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:19.234
No.

00:06:19.234 --> 00:06:20.035
Call Mr. Wang.

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:25.155
The Power Supply Bureau
is severely understaffed right now.

00:06:25.368 --> 00:06:27.075
There are many power poles
to be installed.

00:06:27.075 --> 00:06:28.554
We're super busy.

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:29.194
I don't buy it.

00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:30.872
I'm short-staffed too.

00:06:31.395 --> 00:06:33.434
We need sufficient manpower
to build a big city.

00:06:33.754 --> 00:06:35.155
Yes, listen to me.

00:06:35.674 --> 00:06:37.515
You saw those temporary power poles.

00:06:37.515 --> 00:06:38.874
The wires up there are tangled.

00:06:39.035 --> 00:06:40.434
Don't you know they're overloaded?

00:06:40.754 --> 00:06:41.874
I won't take the risk.

00:06:43.075 --> 00:06:44.455
Either Wang Defa or you take it.

00:06:44.835 --> 00:06:47.554
How could I possibly take it?

00:06:47.794 --> 00:06:48.715
There you go.

00:06:49.395 --> 00:06:50.975
Call Wang Defa right now.

00:06:51.395 --> 00:06:53.525
If it isn't solved today,
you're not going anywhere.

00:06:53.525 --> 00:06:55.194
Give me a concrete installation date.

00:06:55.434 --> 00:06:56.754
It must be done by standards.

00:06:57.275 --> 00:06:59.114
Each power pole must
be spaced 50 meters apart.

00:06:59.434 --> 00:07:01.554
Don't let those wires
resemble a fishing net.

00:07:05.835 --> 00:07:07.674
Call him now,
and then meet me at the clinic.

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.475
(Conference Room)
Wait, don't leave.

00:07:10.595 --> 00:07:11.794
The problem isn't solved yet.

00:07:11.794 --> 00:07:12.915
Problem solved.

00:07:13.314 --> 00:07:14.595
Problem solved.

00:07:15.155 --> 00:07:15.754
Good news.

00:07:16.114 --> 00:07:20.395
West of Fuyu Road,
there's an abandoned basketball court,

00:07:20.955 --> 00:07:23.234
currently used for drying fishing nets
and sundries.

00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:25.515
Deng, coordinate this immediately.

00:07:25.635 --> 00:07:28.314
Tell them that I ordered it cleared.

00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:30.835
You can dry your grain there.

00:07:31.234 --> 00:07:31.874
Okay.

00:07:32.975 --> 00:07:33.475
It's solved.

00:07:33.475 --> 00:07:34.674
- Thank you.
- Happy now?

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:35.254
Sure.

00:07:35.515 --> 00:07:36.075
Thank you.

00:07:36.234 --> 00:07:36.835
Go ahead.

00:07:37.035 --> 00:07:38.715
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

00:07:38.715 --> 00:07:39.234
Thanks.

00:07:39.434 --> 00:07:39.934
You may go.

00:07:40.035 --> 00:07:41.114
Go and dry your grain.

00:07:41.314 --> 00:07:41.874
Thank you.

00:07:41.874 --> 00:07:42.434
Go now.

00:07:42.434 --> 00:07:43.275
- Thanks.
- Come on.

00:07:45.395 --> 00:07:46.035
Mr. Xie.

00:07:47.475 --> 00:07:48.075
Task completed.

00:07:48.475 --> 00:07:50.835
Mr. Wang will resolve
your power pole issue next week.

00:07:52.635 --> 00:07:53.835
High efficiency, huh?

00:07:53.994 --> 00:07:54.494
Yes.

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:55.635
I have to go, Mr. Xie.

00:07:56.354 --> 00:07:56.854
See you.

00:08:00.794 --> 00:08:01.955
Implement it promptly.

00:08:02.135 --> 00:08:02.635
Okay.

00:08:02.635 --> 00:08:05.015
- I'll see you again if it gets nowhere.
- Alright.

00:08:09.294 --> 00:08:09.794
Mr. Du.

00:08:09.794 --> 00:08:10.434
Hello, Mr. Xie.

00:08:12.056 --> 00:08:13.035
Are you not here for me?

00:08:13.035 --> 00:08:13.994
I'm here for Mr. Tan.

00:08:14.155 --> 00:08:14.874
Have you seen him?

00:08:15.035 --> 00:08:15.595
No, I haven't.

00:08:15.975 --> 00:08:16.475
He's away?

00:08:16.475 --> 00:08:17.354
So, you...

00:08:17.354 --> 00:08:17.854
Mr. Du.

00:08:18.354 --> 00:08:18.874
Hello.

00:08:19.455 --> 00:08:22.155
I previously interviewed
about the city inspectors.

00:08:22.275 --> 00:08:24.035
- I have follow-up questions.
- Hi, Mr. Du.

00:08:24.095 --> 00:08:24.595
Hello.

00:08:24.595 --> 00:08:25.275
- Mr. Du.
- Hello.

00:08:26.595 --> 00:08:28.075
Regarding the previous interview,

00:08:28.114 --> 00:08:30.314
I'd like to explore a few more aspects
thoroughly.

00:08:30.554 --> 00:08:31.475
Thanks for attention.

00:08:31.715 --> 00:08:35.074
I read your article on Lin Dongfu.

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:35.615
Excellent.

00:08:35.674 --> 00:08:36.174
Mr. Du.

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:37.015
Hello.

00:08:37.635 --> 00:08:39.074
Is he just wandering around?

00:08:41.714 --> 00:08:45.434
- Your report on Gao Xuemei was good.
- Thank you.

00:08:45.434 --> 00:08:47.535
So next,
you'll write about Tan Guangming, right?

00:08:47.674 --> 00:08:49.074
And then me.

00:08:50.355 --> 00:08:51.755
Great.

00:08:52.275 --> 00:08:53.035
Mr. Xie,

00:08:53.714 --> 00:08:55.074
about interviewing you,

00:08:55.155 --> 00:08:56.735
I've carefully considered it.

00:08:57.194 --> 00:08:58.674
But I haven't yet

00:08:58.755 --> 00:09:00.474
found the right angle.

00:09:00.834 --> 00:09:02.235
I probably need more time

00:09:02.714 --> 00:09:04.355
to analyze your qualities.

00:09:05.594 --> 00:09:06.814
- I have no qualities?
- Mr. Tan.

00:09:06.875 --> 00:09:07.434
Seriously?

00:09:07.434 --> 00:09:08.035
You're here.

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:09.155
I've been here.

00:09:09.434 --> 00:09:10.314
I have no qualities?

00:09:10.434 --> 00:09:11.554
You said you would take me

00:09:11.554 --> 00:09:12.314
somewhere.

00:09:12.554 --> 00:09:13.594
Shall we go now?

00:09:13.714 --> 00:09:14.794
Sure, let's go.

00:09:15.155 --> 00:09:15.714
Xie.

00:09:15.834 --> 00:09:17.834
I'm heading out with Mr. Du.
See you later.

00:09:18.194 --> 00:09:18.995
Goodbye, Mr. Xie.

00:09:22.794 --> 00:09:23.474
We are...

00:09:23.474 --> 00:09:24.714
This way.

00:09:31.554 --> 00:09:32.635
Don't I have any qualities?

00:09:34.755 --> 00:09:36.434
Get this entire tree in frame.

00:09:36.474 --> 00:09:37.714
Mr. Tan, step forward a bit.

00:09:38.194 --> 00:09:39.355
- Yes.
- Two steps forward.

00:09:39.355 --> 00:09:40.434
So, if I get closer to you,

00:09:40.594 --> 00:09:42.074
- this tree will be in frame?
- Yes.

00:09:42.355 --> 00:09:42.915
Got it.

00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:44.434
Get ready.

00:09:44.615 --> 00:09:45.115
Sorry.

00:09:45.115 --> 00:09:45.794
Wait a moment.

00:09:47.674 --> 00:09:48.594
Take off my glasses.

00:09:49.035 --> 00:09:49.714
Are you ready?

00:09:49.735 --> 00:09:50.635
Sure, I'm ready.

00:09:50.635 --> 00:09:51.314
I'll take it now.

00:09:51.554 --> 00:09:52.054
Okay.

00:09:52.355 --> 00:09:54.915
Three, two, one.

00:09:56.275 --> 00:09:56.775
Done.

00:09:56.954 --> 00:09:58.434
Perfect! Thank you.

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:00.355
This tree was

00:10:00.434 --> 00:10:01.635
in the frame, right?

00:10:01.714 --> 00:10:02.474
Sure. Don't worry.

00:10:02.515 --> 00:10:03.275
Thank you.

00:10:03.674 --> 00:10:04.174
Mr. Tan.

00:10:04.434 --> 00:10:05.915
You brought me all the way here

00:10:05.995 --> 00:10:07.474
just to photograph this tree?

00:10:08.594 --> 00:10:10.635
Anyway, this tree means a lot to me.

00:10:11.755 --> 00:10:12.635
Mr. Du,

00:10:12.674 --> 00:10:14.194
could you do me one favor?

00:10:14.834 --> 00:10:16.434
When the article gets published,

00:10:16.554 --> 00:10:17.594
could you

00:10:17.635 --> 00:10:19.035
use the photo with this tree?

00:10:19.434 --> 00:10:21.314
Sure, I could, but why?

00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:23.995
Do you have a history with this tree?

00:10:25.995 --> 00:10:26.755
Well, it's just

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:28.954
that I've been in Yuehai for decades.

00:10:33.875 --> 00:10:35.355
This tree wasn't nearly this big.

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:37.074
So what?

00:10:37.995 --> 00:10:38.714
Well...

00:10:40.135 --> 00:10:40.635
Can we

00:10:40.635 --> 00:10:41.314
take another one?

00:10:41.355 --> 00:10:42.194
Could you also

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:44.344
include the Yuejiang Bridge
in the background?

00:10:44.504 --> 00:10:46.794
That bridge hasn't changed
in over a thousand years.

00:10:47.235 --> 00:10:48.594
Okay, no problem.

00:10:48.594 --> 00:10:49.554
I'll just snap one more.

00:10:49.714 --> 00:10:50.214
Thanks.

00:10:50.635 --> 00:10:51.474
So sorry about this.

00:10:51.554 --> 00:10:52.155
It's okay.

00:10:53.434 --> 00:10:53.934
Good.

00:10:54.674 --> 00:10:56.474
Mr. Tan, shift slightly left.

00:10:56.995 --> 00:10:58.515
Okay, like this?

00:10:58.674 --> 00:10:59.515
(Yuejiang Bridge)
Good. Perfect.

00:11:00.355 --> 00:11:01.995
Three, two, one.

00:11:03.834 --> 00:11:04.355
Qiuping.

00:11:06.155 --> 00:11:06.655
Mr. Zheng.

00:11:07.115 --> 00:11:09.235
Qiuping, I have to
go back to work after lunch.

00:11:09.314 --> 00:11:10.424
I'll try to return tonight.

00:11:11.074 --> 00:11:12.474
Don't forget what you need to take.

00:11:12.794 --> 00:11:15.375
Don't worry. I remember. Leaving now.

00:11:20.275 --> 00:11:23.875
Mr. Zheng, Ms. Li, we're back.

00:11:25.755 --> 00:11:28.314
Mr. Zheng, Ms. Li,

00:11:28.995 --> 00:11:30.954
I'm here to report something.

00:11:31.594 --> 00:11:32.355
What happened?

00:11:34.474 --> 00:11:37.074
Tell us now. Did Mr. Lin succeed?

00:11:42.834 --> 00:11:43.755
He's coming.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.376
(Delicious and affordable. Try it now!)

00:11:49.235 --> 00:11:50.474
Mr. Lin, you're here.

00:11:50.954 --> 00:11:54.115
Same as usual?
Please sit. I'll be quick.

00:11:55.235 --> 00:11:55.735
I...

00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:01.875
- I...
- Sit.

00:12:11.115 --> 00:12:11.674
I'm scared.

00:12:24.474 --> 00:12:25.474
Why is it so quiet?

00:12:26.074 --> 00:12:26.834
I have no idea.

00:12:27.434 --> 00:12:27.995
Check again.

00:12:28.155 --> 00:12:28.655
Okay.

00:12:51.434 --> 00:12:52.194
Coming!

00:12:52.834 --> 00:12:53.674
You sit. It's hot.

00:12:53.954 --> 00:12:54.454
Okay.

00:12:54.794 --> 00:12:56.275
Eat slowly.

00:12:58.314 --> 00:13:00.714
Didn't he come
to help Yan close her stall?

00:13:01.016 --> 00:13:02.434
How come he is eating?

00:13:04.155 --> 00:13:05.635
Qingtian, be patient.

00:13:06.275 --> 00:13:09.035
C-Confessing takes courage.

00:13:09.314 --> 00:13:10.515
What courage?

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:14.194
Just step forward,
open your mouth, and speak.

00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:17.155
What's so hard
about helping her close her stall?

00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:23.155
It's actually hard.

00:13:28.434 --> 00:13:30.515
Finished already? Thanks.

00:13:41.594 --> 00:13:42.474
Let me help you close.

00:13:44.755 --> 00:13:45.314
No need.

00:13:46.074 --> 00:13:46.954
No need, Mr. Lin.

00:14:00.554 --> 00:14:01.115
Well...

00:14:04.235 --> 00:14:04.794
Put it there.

00:14:07.794 --> 00:14:08.915
See you, Mr. Lin.

00:14:09.635 --> 00:14:10.434
He's leaving?

00:14:10.674 --> 00:14:11.174
He's going.

00:14:13.915 --> 00:14:15.794
Mr. Lin, the chain is off!

00:14:16.074 --> 00:14:17.314
Stop shouting!

00:14:17.915 --> 00:14:18.794
Are you alright?

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:20.074
I'm fine.

00:14:20.334 --> 00:14:20.834
Let me help.

00:14:20.834 --> 00:14:22.474
No! You'll get your hands dirty.

00:14:22.515 --> 00:14:24.035
I can handle this.

00:14:26.194 --> 00:14:26.714
Well,

00:14:27.275 --> 00:14:28.915
it's fine. No worries. I can manage.

00:14:36.235 --> 00:14:37.635
He just ran off like that.

00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:40.235
That's quite in character for him.

00:14:40.954 --> 00:14:42.594
Why did Lin run like that?

00:14:43.915 --> 00:14:44.554
Ms. Li.

00:14:44.915 --> 00:14:48.515
Lin's happiness
in his later years will depend on you.

00:14:50.275 --> 00:14:51.074
Out of my way!

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:40.056
Xie.

00:15:40.275 --> 00:15:41.074
What are you doing?

00:15:41.115 --> 00:15:42.594
Mr. Xie, are you putting out a fire?

00:15:42.594 --> 00:15:43.875
Put me down!

00:15:47.314 --> 00:15:48.395
I've put out the fire.

00:15:49.235 --> 00:15:50.674
What? Mr. Xie!

00:15:51.395 --> 00:15:53.074
I finally learned how to cook this dish.

00:15:53.074 --> 00:15:55.995
You smothered my stove!
Look what you've done.

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:58.395
Mr. Xie was putting out a fire?

00:15:59.594 --> 00:16:00.515
Mr. Xie!

00:16:00.714 --> 00:16:03.995
This is my quilt. You used it for this?

00:16:04.794 --> 00:16:05.714
How could you...

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:07.834
Look,

00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:08.995
my quilt

00:16:08.995 --> 00:16:10.355
is now covered in oil.

00:16:10.554 --> 00:16:11.355
That's your quilt?

00:16:11.434 --> 00:16:12.875
How do I wash this?

00:16:14.794 --> 00:16:15.294
Well...

00:16:16.954 --> 00:16:17.454
I...

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:25.155
Enough.

00:16:25.594 --> 00:16:26.594
Stop gawking here!

00:16:26.834 --> 00:16:27.714
Get back to work!

00:16:28.275 --> 00:16:29.155
Go have your meals!

00:16:30.875 --> 00:16:32.194
- Let's go.
- Get out of here.

00:16:32.594 --> 00:16:34.554
What a waste of my dish!

00:16:35.235 --> 00:16:36.275
I heard

00:16:36.355 --> 00:16:37.515
you're developing new dishes.

00:16:37.515 --> 00:16:38.314
Are you hurt?

00:16:38.314 --> 00:16:39.794
Is this to help the town government

00:16:39.794 --> 00:16:41.235
and improve everyone's meals?

00:16:41.995 --> 00:16:43.035
Yes, Mr. Du.

00:16:43.115 --> 00:16:46.155
Yuehai develops every single day.

00:16:46.155 --> 00:16:47.355
I should keep up too, right?

00:16:47.355 --> 00:16:48.875
Tell me about your new dishes.

00:16:49.074 --> 00:16:51.074
I'll take some photos of you first.

00:16:51.074 --> 00:16:52.035
Taking my photos?

00:16:52.635 --> 00:16:54.714
Is this okay?

00:16:54.794 --> 00:16:55.875
(Saving Food Starts With You and Me)
Yes, very good!

00:16:55.915 --> 00:16:57.155
Just relax.

00:16:57.155 --> 00:16:59.000
Do what you'd normally do.

00:16:59.832 --> 00:17:00.635
Okay.

00:17:27.075 --> 00:17:28.115
What are you doing?

00:17:28.355 --> 00:17:30.674
Mr. Zheng, I'm bathing!

00:17:31.595 --> 00:17:33.034
Is this a bath or a foot soak?

00:17:33.474 --> 00:17:34.712
You're not even in the water.

00:17:35.234 --> 00:17:36.714
I was just joking.

00:17:37.075 --> 00:17:38.194
You went in with clothes?

00:17:38.754 --> 00:17:39.555
Get out right now.

00:17:39.714 --> 00:17:40.635
What's on your mind?

00:17:41.635 --> 00:17:43.674
I've been looking for you.
What are you thinking?

00:17:43.954 --> 00:17:45.234
Out. Get out.

00:17:45.635 --> 00:17:46.434
Come on.

00:17:48.555 --> 00:17:50.115
What's wrong with you?

00:17:55.875 --> 00:17:56.595
Mr. Zheng.

00:17:58.075 --> 00:17:59.115
They're right.

00:18:00.315 --> 00:18:01.875
I'm a man without qualities.

00:18:03.795 --> 00:18:05.434
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:18:06.474 --> 00:18:07.714
They're all correct.

00:18:08.595 --> 00:18:10.155
Everything I say is nonsense, huh?

00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:14.754
Sit down and talk.

00:18:16.835 --> 00:18:17.335
Sit.

00:18:18.754 --> 00:18:20.155
Sit down.

00:18:22.954 --> 00:18:23.714
Xie.

00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:26.714
Remember what I told you?

00:18:27.555 --> 00:18:30.474
I called you Yuehai's quartermaster.

00:18:31.714 --> 00:18:32.795
That came from my heart.

00:18:33.555 --> 00:18:35.595
You truly are Yuehai's quartermaster.

00:18:37.234 --> 00:18:38.434
We can't function without you.

00:18:40.434 --> 00:18:41.514
I know you're nice to me.

00:18:43.635 --> 00:18:45.034
You've always said this

00:18:45.915 --> 00:18:46.954
to spare my feelings.

00:18:49.115 --> 00:18:52.155
I know everyone treats me kindly too,
but none of you told me.

00:18:53.234 --> 00:18:54.234
Now, I know

00:18:56.434 --> 00:18:58.954
I'm a man without qualities.

00:19:00.795 --> 00:19:02.795
A man without qualities is useless.

00:19:04.434 --> 00:19:05.434
Yuehai doesn't need me.

00:19:07.514 --> 00:19:08.355
Right now,

00:19:10.714 --> 00:19:11.795
I'm just very sad.

00:19:15.234 --> 00:19:16.514
I can't accept it.

00:19:19.754 --> 00:19:20.635
Right now,

00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:23.915
I'm less motivated.

00:19:25.835 --> 00:19:26.595
Are you?

00:19:32.595 --> 00:19:33.434
No fever.

00:19:35.835 --> 00:19:36.954
So why the nonsense?

00:19:38.474 --> 00:19:39.635
Who said you were useless?

00:19:39.954 --> 00:19:43.034
You're Yuehai's most vital asset.
Understand?

00:19:43.994 --> 00:19:44.795
Listen,

00:19:45.315 --> 00:19:47.835
you're the most vital asset. Got it?

00:19:48.194 --> 00:19:49.075
What I say goes.

00:19:49.474 --> 00:19:51.474
You're the most vital asset.

00:19:54.514 --> 00:19:55.194
Really?

00:19:56.555 --> 00:19:58.115
When have I ever lied to you?

00:20:00.635 --> 00:20:01.635
You're a good man.

00:20:02.075 --> 00:20:04.155
Xie Chunlai, let me ask you.

00:20:04.754 --> 00:20:06.514
Did you schedule
today's safety inspection?

00:20:06.835 --> 00:20:07.514
Yes.

00:20:08.075 --> 00:20:09.835
Did you read the central documents?

00:20:10.714 --> 00:20:11.434
Yes.

00:20:11.576 --> 00:20:13.464
Did you attend
the Women's Federation meeting?

00:20:13.795 --> 00:20:14.434
Yes.

00:20:14.795 --> 00:20:15.835
That's good.

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:18.155
So, you've done your jobs perfectly.

00:20:18.514 --> 00:20:19.014
Look,

00:20:19.595 --> 00:20:20.835
I'll reward you with something.

00:20:21.994 --> 00:20:22.674
What's this?

00:20:24.635 --> 00:20:25.315
(Apple Jam)
Octopus.

00:20:26.034 --> 00:20:27.194
That's you!

00:20:28.115 --> 00:20:30.355
Aren't you the octopus
of our town government?

00:20:30.674 --> 00:20:31.875
(Apple Jam)

00:20:31.875 --> 00:20:33.835
You're everywhere, right?

00:20:33.994 --> 00:20:35.595
You're incredibly capable.

00:20:35.674 --> 00:20:37.474
Nothing can get done without you, right?

00:20:37.795 --> 00:20:38.875
We absolutely need you.

00:20:39.875 --> 00:20:42.234
Look, you two actually look a bit alike.

00:20:42.714 --> 00:20:44.635
Both have big, sparkling eyes.

00:20:44.674 --> 00:20:45.835
It's really cute.

00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:46.635
- See?
- Mr. Zheng.

00:20:48.674 --> 00:20:50.355
Can you leave it and me alone?

00:20:52.315 --> 00:20:52.954
Okay.

00:20:54.274 --> 00:20:55.674
No problem.

00:20:57.434 --> 00:20:59.434
Thank you.

00:21:01.795 --> 00:21:03.474
Just don't eat it, okay?

00:21:06.194 --> 00:21:07.075
I'm leaving.

00:21:09.355 --> 00:21:10.034
Take your time.

00:21:32.674 --> 00:21:34.434
I'm an octopus?

00:21:35.595 --> 00:21:36.234
Octopus.

00:22:04.875 --> 00:22:07.315
Mr. Lin, Qiuping asked me
to bring this to you.

00:22:07.674 --> 00:22:09.194
It's a token of our appreciation.

00:22:09.474 --> 00:22:10.875
Thank you for the interview.

00:22:11.075 --> 00:22:13.115
No, I can't accept this.

00:22:13.355 --> 00:22:14.635
Th-Thank you, Ms. Li.

00:22:15.194 --> 00:22:16.875
But cooperating
with your work is my duty.

00:22:17.194 --> 00:22:17.795
I...

00:22:18.115 --> 00:22:18.835
Please, take it.

00:22:19.915 --> 00:22:21.194
Open it and take a look.

00:22:24.915 --> 00:22:25.415
Well...

00:22:32.994 --> 00:22:34.514
I definitely can't take it.

00:22:34.915 --> 00:22:37.674
Mr. Du gave you this, right, Ms. Li?

00:22:38.434 --> 00:22:39.635
I'm just a rough man. I...

00:22:39.915 --> 00:22:41.355
I don't use it, really.

00:22:41.714 --> 00:22:43.635
Mr. Lin, you don't use it.

00:22:44.274 --> 00:22:46.635
But you could gift it to someone.

00:22:47.875 --> 00:22:48.994
Gift it to someone?

00:22:49.395 --> 00:22:50.994
I use this brand of soap myself.

00:22:51.754 --> 00:22:52.954
The scent is wonderful.

00:22:54.194 --> 00:22:56.795
It can wash away
the meat smell from your hands.

00:22:57.434 --> 00:22:58.954
Yes, the meat smell.

00:23:00.434 --> 00:23:01.034
Meat smell?

00:23:08.274 --> 00:23:09.674
Well, no.

00:23:10.434 --> 00:23:11.075
I...

00:23:11.474 --> 00:23:11.974
Just...

00:23:12.915 --> 00:23:14.234
She...

00:23:14.915 --> 00:23:15.415
I...

00:23:16.075 --> 00:23:17.595
Mr. Lin, are you trying to say

00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:21.075
I really like her,
but I don't dare give her a gift?

00:23:21.434 --> 00:23:23.155
What if she rejects it?

00:23:23.835 --> 00:23:27.274
Then I could never go eat
at her wonton stall again?

00:23:30.034 --> 00:23:30.875
Yes, I...

00:23:34.835 --> 00:23:35.434
Sit down.

00:23:35.954 --> 00:23:36.674
Sit down.

00:23:38.674 --> 00:23:39.274
Well,

00:23:39.714 --> 00:23:41.674
let me tell you a story about myself.

00:23:43.474 --> 00:23:45.194
When I first saw Qiuping,

00:23:45.714 --> 00:23:46.994
I fell for her at first sight.

00:23:48.274 --> 00:23:49.795
Qiuping was the campus beauty.

00:23:50.155 --> 00:23:52.635
The guys who liked her...
How should I put it?

00:23:54.264 --> 00:23:55.704
They could line up from your dorm

00:23:55.994 --> 00:23:57.595
to the gate of the town government.

00:23:57.915 --> 00:23:58.915
Don't be exaggerated!

00:23:59.434 --> 00:24:00.434
I said the truth.

00:24:00.474 --> 00:24:02.595
Many guys liked you back then,
but you didn't know.

00:24:03.915 --> 00:24:06.274
And I had a really strong rival.

00:24:06.555 --> 00:24:08.155
He was tall and handsome,

00:24:08.194 --> 00:24:10.555
with grades better than mine.
He's a genius.

00:24:10.754 --> 00:24:11.875
He went to study abroad.

00:24:12.615 --> 00:24:14.315
He liked Qiuping too,

00:24:14.714 --> 00:24:16.635
but after Qiuping rejected him once,

00:24:16.875 --> 00:24:17.635
he just gave up.

00:24:17.994 --> 00:24:19.234
Then, whenever he saw Qiuping,

00:24:19.434 --> 00:24:21.274
he'd freeze like a stone,
couldn't say a word.

00:24:21.555 --> 00:24:22.754
We even gave him a nickname,

00:24:23.075 --> 00:24:24.555
called Qi the Stone, remember?

00:24:25.994 --> 00:24:26.915
But do you know

00:24:27.434 --> 00:24:29.034
how many times Qiuping rejected me?

00:24:30.115 --> 00:24:30.754
How many times?

00:24:31.474 --> 00:24:32.194
Five.

00:24:33.795 --> 00:24:34.635
Only five?

00:24:34.954 --> 00:24:36.835
Even it's five hundred,
I'd never give up.

00:24:39.315 --> 00:24:39.835
Mr. Lin.

00:24:40.194 --> 00:24:42.835
I want to say,
you need to learn from me.

00:24:43.714 --> 00:24:44.954
Don't be afraid of rejection.

00:24:45.155 --> 00:24:45.655
Right.

00:24:47.514 --> 00:24:48.474
Mr. Du, I...

00:24:49.754 --> 00:24:51.194
I-I just...

00:24:51.954 --> 00:24:52.994
I really can't learn this.

00:24:53.434 --> 00:24:55.674
I-I don't know how to talk to women.

00:24:56.075 --> 00:24:56.714
Especially

00:24:57.954 --> 00:24:58.835
Sun Xiaoyan.

00:24:59.115 --> 00:25:00.315
When I see her, I...

00:25:00.875 --> 00:25:02.234
I can't say a single word.

00:25:04.234 --> 00:25:06.075
Mr. Lin, actually,

00:25:06.434 --> 00:25:07.674
you can talk to women.

00:25:07.954 --> 00:25:09.954
But when facing Sun Xiaoyan,

00:25:10.234 --> 00:25:12.075
you get too nervous to speak.

00:25:12.434 --> 00:25:14.194
It's okay. We can help you.

00:25:14.875 --> 00:25:16.315
We give you the courage to confess.

00:25:19.034 --> 00:25:19.795
First,

00:25:21.075 --> 00:25:22.714
you need to change your look.

00:25:25.714 --> 00:25:27.355
Mr. Lin, look.

00:25:59.595 --> 00:26:00.434
No way.

00:26:00.754 --> 00:26:01.514
Take it off.

00:26:01.795 --> 00:26:02.674
Off! Try this one.

00:26:03.274 --> 00:26:03.774
Take it off.

00:26:06.434 --> 00:26:07.434
It looks better

00:26:09.274 --> 00:26:09.994
on me.

00:26:14.395 --> 00:26:15.315
What a difference.

00:26:33.835 --> 00:26:34.555
A bit

00:26:35.234 --> 00:26:35.875
handsome?

00:26:52.714 --> 00:26:53.875
Oh my, Lin!

00:26:55.034 --> 00:26:56.474
You look so handsome!

00:26:57.635 --> 00:26:59.395
I didn't notice you were this handsome.

00:27:00.875 --> 00:27:01.395
You...

00:27:01.875 --> 00:27:04.194
Go for it. Not to mention Sun Xiaoyan,

00:27:04.754 --> 00:27:06.754
even I'd be smitten if I were a woman.

00:27:08.434 --> 00:27:09.395
Mr. Zheng is right.

00:27:10.034 --> 00:27:12.274
Everything's ready now.
You just need to make the move.

00:27:14.355 --> 00:27:16.274
It's almost nine.
Mr. Lin, time to head out.

00:27:16.754 --> 00:27:17.635
Are you ready?

00:27:18.835 --> 00:27:19.474
I'm ready.

00:27:20.274 --> 00:27:20.795
Action!

00:27:20.954 --> 00:27:21.454
Yes!

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:25.234
♪You're but a fleeting spark♪

00:27:25.234 --> 00:27:25.976
Go for it.

00:27:26.136 --> 00:27:29.281
♪The white doves across the lake♪

00:27:31.279 --> 00:27:34.941
♪No one can understand your fervor♪

00:27:36.135 --> 00:27:39.142
♪Your persistence♪

00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:43.441
♪You're the gentle passage of a book♪

00:27:43.702 --> 00:27:48.262
♪You're the wind-stirred river
of my heart♪

00:27:48.483 --> 00:27:52.522
♪The loneliness left by old dreams♪

00:27:53.348 --> 00:27:57.932
♪Leaving traces, yet you shy away♪

00:28:01.754 --> 00:28:04.635
Lin Tofu!

00:28:06.835 --> 00:28:09.155
Xie, I'm ready.

00:28:10.954 --> 00:28:11.674
You can't go!

00:28:15.835 --> 00:28:16.514
Why not?

00:28:25.155 --> 00:28:26.875
Sun Xiaoyan has a man!

00:28:42.635 --> 00:28:45.115
Xie Chunlai, what took you so long?
Get back here!

00:28:46.194 --> 00:28:47.714
Stop being mysterious.

00:28:54.674 --> 00:28:56.395
Mr. Xie, you must be mistaken.

00:28:56.994 --> 00:28:58.835
How could Sun Xiaoyan have a man?

00:28:59.434 --> 00:29:00.075
Everyone,

00:29:01.434 --> 00:29:02.274
today,

00:29:03.514 --> 00:29:06.234
I visited Yan's wonton stall.

00:29:07.514 --> 00:29:10.635
When I got there,
I sensed something off.

00:29:11.434 --> 00:29:14.075
A guy was there, dressed really sharp,

00:29:15.915 --> 00:29:18.395
carrying a whole basket of this.

00:29:19.194 --> 00:29:19.915
Sandalwood soaps.

00:29:23.555 --> 00:29:25.315
Smell it. Come on, smell it.

00:29:25.434 --> 00:29:27.635
I've told you so many times,

00:29:27.674 --> 00:29:29.194
don't come to me anymore.

00:29:32.315 --> 00:29:33.355
Look, I already have one.

00:29:33.635 --> 00:29:34.234
Yan,

00:29:35.395 --> 00:29:36.555
this has sandalwood smell.

00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:38.234
It's different from what you have.

00:29:39.555 --> 00:29:40.075
Yan,

00:29:40.555 --> 00:29:42.355
I really love you. Yan.

00:29:42.355 --> 00:29:43.434
Let me be honest with you.

00:29:43.994 --> 00:29:44.835
I have a man.

00:29:45.674 --> 00:29:48.234
Impossible! I never heard you had a man.

00:29:48.915 --> 00:29:50.075
You must be lying.

00:29:51.395 --> 00:29:52.115
Smell it.

00:29:52.714 --> 00:29:54.635
If you don't believe me,
look for yourself.

00:29:58.795 --> 00:29:59.754
Let me see.

00:30:01.234 --> 00:30:01.835
It's a soldier.

00:30:01.835 --> 00:30:02.915
- Go away!
- A soldier?

00:30:02.994 --> 00:30:03.514
Go away.

00:30:04.714 --> 00:30:05.315
Mr. Xie.

00:30:07.714 --> 00:30:08.395
A soldier?

00:30:09.194 --> 00:30:11.034
Sun Xiaoyan's husband is a soldier?

00:30:11.395 --> 00:30:12.714
I saw it with my own eyes

00:30:12.795 --> 00:30:14.234
and heard it loud and clear.

00:30:14.474 --> 00:30:15.714
Oh my! Seriously!

00:30:15.994 --> 00:30:18.434
That's terrifying.
Luckily you didn't go.

00:30:18.754 --> 00:30:21.115
Or, it would've led to disaster.

00:30:21.174 --> 00:30:21.674
Right?

00:30:21.674 --> 00:30:22.174
Luckily I...

00:30:22.194 --> 00:30:24.514
Undermining a military
marriage is illegal!

00:30:25.835 --> 00:30:27.434
Why didn't we know this before?

00:30:28.274 --> 00:30:28.954
We...

00:30:29.194 --> 00:30:29.915
That day,

00:30:30.234 --> 00:30:32.155
I went and helped her pack up

00:30:32.234 --> 00:30:33.274
when she was closing up.

00:30:33.674 --> 00:30:35.115
Her mother and son were there too.

00:30:35.795 --> 00:30:36.835
Her son said,

00:30:37.355 --> 00:30:39.474
he'd never even met his father.

00:30:43.194 --> 00:30:43.694
Never...

00:30:43.795 --> 00:30:44.555
That makes sense.

00:30:45.434 --> 00:30:47.635
His father is a soldier,
must be defending the country.

00:30:47.795 --> 00:30:48.600
So they never met.

00:30:48.835 --> 00:30:50.795
I think Ms. Li meant well.

00:30:51.155 --> 00:30:52.754
She didn't expect this, right?

00:30:52.994 --> 00:30:54.795
But we should be more careful.

00:30:54.994 --> 00:30:55.835
Otherwise, well...

00:30:55.835 --> 00:30:56.434
Now...

00:30:56.835 --> 00:30:58.795
I'll go ask her to clear things up.

00:30:58.795 --> 00:30:59.295
No.

00:30:59.434 --> 00:31:01.034
It's too late for that now.

00:31:01.234 --> 00:31:02.635
She's already shown the photo.

00:31:02.714 --> 00:31:03.274
Right.

00:31:03.555 --> 00:31:04.875
A marriage certificate next time.

00:31:05.115 --> 00:31:07.295
True. A woman
cares about her reputation.

00:31:07.295 --> 00:31:08.835
Won't lie on such things.

00:31:09.915 --> 00:31:10.754
True.

00:31:12.315 --> 00:31:13.155
Sun Xiaoyan

00:31:14.355 --> 00:31:15.514
is such a fine woman.

00:31:15.514 --> 00:31:16.014
How could

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:19.155
she still be single?

00:31:22.155 --> 00:31:22.915
Ms. Li,

00:31:23.315 --> 00:31:25.115
you should've asked her directly.

00:31:25.274 --> 00:31:25.954
My master...

00:31:27.434 --> 00:31:29.115
Romance is fatal.

00:31:30.115 --> 00:31:30.994
It's my fault.

00:31:32.474 --> 00:31:32.994
Lin,

00:31:33.514 --> 00:31:35.474
don't lose faith in women now.

00:31:35.835 --> 00:31:36.792
Nice women are around.

00:31:37.915 --> 00:31:40.315
Li, what did you just say?
I didn't catch it.

00:31:41.474 --> 00:31:43.075
I said it's my fault.

00:31:44.555 --> 00:31:46.194
Mr. Lin, it's my mistake.

00:31:46.395 --> 00:31:47.555
I wasn't careful enough.

00:31:47.635 --> 00:31:49.274
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

00:31:49.555 --> 00:31:50.575
Wait, well...

00:31:50.954 --> 00:31:53.474
Ms. Li, it's okay.

00:31:53.795 --> 00:31:56.474
Don't blame yourself. I'm fine, really.

00:32:00.514 --> 00:32:02.474
It's nothing serious.

00:32:02.795 --> 00:32:03.915
Being single...

00:32:05.194 --> 00:32:07.194
Being single is great.

00:32:07.355 --> 00:32:08.194
Carefree and easy.

00:32:08.315 --> 00:32:09.795
I've long gotten used to it.

00:32:10.474 --> 00:32:11.355
Doesn't matter.

00:32:14.994 --> 00:32:16.994
I... Thank you all.

00:32:17.155 --> 00:32:19.288
Sorry for bothering you.

00:32:23.096 --> 00:32:24.434
Lin, don't overthink it.

00:32:24.434 --> 00:32:26.274
That outfit looks good on you. Keep it.

00:32:26.635 --> 00:32:27.714
Get rest early.

00:32:27.994 --> 00:32:30.075
Be strong, Lin. No tears!

00:32:55.075 --> 00:32:55.835
(My money!)

00:32:57.274 --> 00:32:58.034
Here, take this.

00:33:02.635 --> 00:33:03.135
Thank you.

00:33:10.714 --> 00:33:12.115
Don't try anything sneaky.

00:33:12.395 --> 00:33:13.754
I've got my camera right here.

00:34:03.754 --> 00:34:04.395
Mr. Du,

00:34:05.075 --> 00:34:07.194
your article was truly excellent.

00:34:07.555 --> 00:34:08.275
Thanks, Mr. Zheng.

00:34:09.275 --> 00:34:10.634
No, I should thank you.

00:34:12.154 --> 00:34:12.654
Here.

00:34:14.675 --> 00:34:15.175
Mr. Zheng.

00:34:15.355 --> 00:34:17.434
It's your turn to have an interview.

00:34:17.835 --> 00:34:19.074
Not today.

00:34:19.395 --> 00:34:21.395
I have to go report
to the county secretary.

00:34:22.074 --> 00:34:23.114
Well, Ms. Li.

00:34:23.915 --> 00:34:25.795
Get me that fiscal report now.

00:34:26.074 --> 00:34:27.034
- I'll go to the county office.
- Okay.

00:34:27.034 --> 00:34:27.755
M-Mr. Zheng.

00:34:27.755 --> 00:34:29.395
Just set a date.

00:34:29.395 --> 00:34:29.954
Mr. Zheng.

00:34:31.434 --> 00:34:31.994
Mr. Zheng.

00:34:32.875 --> 00:34:33.395
What's up?

00:34:33.675 --> 00:34:34.715
We're at our wits' end.

00:34:35.355 --> 00:34:38.634
Ms. Li, please help us.

00:34:39.195 --> 00:34:39.875
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

00:34:40.034 --> 00:34:42.114
It's still about
that cable factory quota.

00:34:42.755 --> 00:34:44.114
We've been there several times,

00:34:44.434 --> 00:34:46.915
but Mr. Zhang just won't resolve it.

00:34:47.355 --> 00:34:48.715
Now the villagers are fed up

00:34:49.074 --> 00:34:50.755
and blocking the factory entrance.

00:34:50.954 --> 00:34:51.875
That Zhang Yongwang!

00:34:52.434 --> 00:34:54.634
He dares to go back on his word now?

00:34:55.315 --> 00:34:56.755
The approval documents were issued.

00:34:56.795 --> 00:34:57.315
Yes!

00:34:59.195 --> 00:35:00.355
The root of the problem

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.315
is that the state-owned factory
isn't subordinate to the town government.

00:35:03.315 --> 00:35:05.074
Zhang Yongwang
thinks we can't do anything.

00:35:06.915 --> 00:35:07.434
Mr. Zheng.

00:35:07.715 --> 00:35:10.074
You need to speak to him.

00:35:10.634 --> 00:35:12.275
Please come with me.

00:35:13.195 --> 00:35:14.474
But I need to report

00:35:14.634 --> 00:35:15.915
at the county office.

00:35:16.034 --> 00:35:17.355
Mr. Zheng, maybe I'll go.

00:35:18.915 --> 00:35:20.395
You? Can you handle it?

00:35:20.994 --> 00:35:23.315
Zhang Yongwang
is utterly shameless and cunning.

00:35:23.634 --> 00:35:26.434
When I worked at the county office,
I heard about him.

00:35:26.994 --> 00:35:27.915
Let me give it a try.

00:35:29.675 --> 00:35:32.074
Alright, it's on you now. Careful.

00:35:33.634 --> 00:35:34.195
I'm leaving.

00:35:34.634 --> 00:35:35.275
Go for it.

00:35:35.675 --> 00:35:37.275
Mr. Zheng, shall we set a date?

00:35:37.474 --> 00:35:37.974
No, wait.

00:35:38.034 --> 00:35:38.755
Listen to me.

00:35:38.755 --> 00:35:40.474
You've interviewed
the three deputy mayors.

00:35:40.474 --> 00:35:41.634
It's Ms. Li's turn now.

00:35:42.114 --> 00:35:44.034
Treat everyone equally.
Interview her now, okay?

00:35:44.315 --> 00:35:45.034
Talk later.

00:35:47.634 --> 00:35:49.275
(Pingchuan County People's Government)
We've been here for many times.

00:35:49.395 --> 00:35:50.915
You keep claiming Mr. Zhang isn't in.

00:35:51.275 --> 00:35:52.755
You're slandering me.

00:35:52.915 --> 00:35:53.835
Why gather people here?

00:35:53.915 --> 00:35:54.514
Slandering you?

00:35:54.514 --> 00:35:56.195
Don't make a scene here.

00:35:56.195 --> 00:35:57.634
You promised us.

00:35:58.154 --> 00:35:59.235
Alright. Done talking.

00:35:59.395 --> 00:36:00.074
- Go back.
- Go back.

00:36:01.915 --> 00:36:03.074
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

00:36:03.835 --> 00:36:04.568
Don't touch me!

00:36:10.434 --> 00:36:12.034
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

00:36:12.355 --> 00:36:13.915
Ms. Lin is here. Stop it! Move!

00:36:14.074 --> 00:36:14.795
Ms. Lin is here.

00:36:14.875 --> 00:36:15.375
Ms. Li.

00:36:19.514 --> 00:36:20.954
You can't blame us for this.

00:36:20.954 --> 00:36:21.474
Mr. Zhang.

00:36:21.795 --> 00:36:23.195
I've been drinking for three days.

00:36:23.355 --> 00:36:24.395
- My stomach...
- Listen...

00:36:24.594 --> 00:36:25.094
Mr. Zhang.

00:36:25.114 --> 00:36:25.614
I...

00:36:26.395 --> 00:36:26.895
Enough!

00:36:27.634 --> 00:36:28.434
Stop complaining!

00:36:28.915 --> 00:36:30.154
Are you the salesmen?

00:36:30.514 --> 00:36:31.474
Sold nothing. My fault?

00:36:32.074 --> 00:36:33.715
Mr. Zhang, Ms. Li is here.

00:36:34.514 --> 00:36:35.154
Ms. Li?

00:36:36.074 --> 00:36:36.634
Just her?

00:36:37.154 --> 00:36:37.915
And villagers.

00:36:40.355 --> 00:36:41.074
Zheng Decheng?

00:36:41.434 --> 00:36:42.034
No.

00:36:44.434 --> 00:36:44.934
Go ahead.

00:36:45.315 --> 00:36:45.815
Ms. Li.

00:36:45.954 --> 00:36:47.434
I'm just a Security Chief.

00:36:47.755 --> 00:36:49.875
I had to do as Mr. Zhang instructed.

00:36:50.235 --> 00:36:52.074
Mr. Zhou,
I hate making things difficult.

00:36:52.355 --> 00:36:55.074
But Mr. Zhang himself promised this
to Mr. Zheng.

00:36:55.395 --> 00:36:57.395
We can't just stand by.

00:37:01.755 --> 00:37:03.795
You all need
to seriously reflect on yourselves!

00:37:03.994 --> 00:37:06.915
Submit a sales proposal to me
before leaving work!

00:37:07.675 --> 00:37:08.195
Leave now.

00:37:08.395 --> 00:37:08.994
Get going.

00:37:19.875 --> 00:37:20.554
Mr. Wu.

00:37:20.994 --> 00:37:23.395
Doing this makes it hard for me
to explain to the villagers.

00:37:23.875 --> 00:37:25.795
Our factory is built on their land.

00:37:26.315 --> 00:37:28.915
And we promised them
skilled worker quotas.

00:37:29.154 --> 00:37:30.594
I have to keep my word.

00:37:31.554 --> 00:37:32.275
I understand.

00:37:33.634 --> 00:37:34.195
Mr. Zhang.

00:37:36.634 --> 00:37:38.875
I know it's tough for the Labor Bureau.

00:37:39.395 --> 00:37:41.034
But it's even tougher for the villagers.

00:37:41.474 --> 00:37:43.915
They need jobs. They need income.

00:37:44.114 --> 00:37:45.315
They need to feed themselves.

00:37:46.315 --> 00:37:47.875
I have to get this done.

00:37:49.395 --> 00:37:50.755
Mr. Wu from the Labor Bureau?

00:37:51.154 --> 00:37:52.954
Mr. Zhang, could you pass me the phone?

00:37:53.034 --> 00:37:53.875
I'll talk to him.

00:37:54.554 --> 00:37:56.395
Mr. Wu, Yuehai Town...

00:37:57.994 --> 00:37:59.275
Mr. Wu from the Labor Bureau?

00:37:59.875 --> 00:38:00.375
This...

00:38:01.034 --> 00:38:01.954
The line is busy.

00:38:04.235 --> 00:38:04.915
Cut off again.

00:38:05.634 --> 00:38:07.875
Lines keep cutting off.
Who's in charge of this?

00:38:08.915 --> 00:38:09.514
Sorry.

00:38:12.195 --> 00:38:14.675
Ms. Li, what brings you here today?

00:38:15.074 --> 00:38:16.395
Mr. Zhang, what do you mean?

00:38:16.875 --> 00:38:18.954
Your state-owned cable factory
moved to Yuehai Town.

00:38:18.954 --> 00:38:20.434
I should've visited long ago.

00:38:21.915 --> 00:38:23.715
Wang, make tea for Ms. Li and others.

00:38:23.954 --> 00:38:24.795
Come on, have a seat.

00:38:24.954 --> 00:38:25.755
Have a seat.

00:38:25.954 --> 00:38:26.994
Come on, have a seat.

00:38:26.994 --> 00:38:27.755
Come on. Sit.

00:38:28.634 --> 00:38:29.554
Have a seat.

00:38:29.954 --> 00:38:32.114
We can talk things over.

00:38:35.514 --> 00:38:36.755
Wait, who is he?

00:38:38.034 --> 00:38:39.114
A reporter coming with us.

00:38:39.554 --> 00:38:40.634
Just ignore him.

00:38:41.614 --> 00:38:42.114
I...

00:38:42.114 --> 00:38:43.954
Mr. Zhang, I'll get to the point.

00:38:44.715 --> 00:38:46.235
Regarding Yang Village's quota issue,

00:38:46.395 --> 00:38:47.715
when will you resolve it?

00:38:50.994 --> 00:38:51.755
Wait, Ms. Li.

00:38:52.355 --> 00:38:54.074
Didn't you hear when you came in?

00:38:54.554 --> 00:38:55.514
I'm so worried about it.

00:38:55.994 --> 00:38:57.915
To solve the quota issue
for Yang and others,

00:38:58.355 --> 00:39:00.514
I've been trying my best.

00:39:01.395 --> 00:39:02.915
I went to the county office for times,

00:39:03.395 --> 00:39:05.114
but the Labor Bureau just refused.

00:39:05.594 --> 00:39:07.434
They said to take back
all these job quotas.

00:39:08.315 --> 00:39:09.915
I was almost pleading and crying.

00:39:11.074 --> 00:39:12.474
Mr. Zhang, that's manageable.

00:39:13.114 --> 00:39:15.034
When I was a secretary
at the county office,

00:39:15.154 --> 00:39:16.355
I dealt with Mr. Wu.

00:39:16.634 --> 00:39:17.755
We have a bit of a rapport.

00:39:18.235 --> 00:39:19.795
I'll go to Mr. Wu now.

00:39:20.355 --> 00:39:23.074
Today is Wednesday, study day
for Party and government affairs.

00:39:23.395 --> 00:39:24.355
He is definitely there.

00:39:24.835 --> 00:39:26.195
Wait, Ms. Li.

00:39:26.235 --> 00:39:27.875
Come on, sit down please.

00:39:28.395 --> 00:39:29.195
Sit down.

00:39:29.994 --> 00:39:32.875
Don't bother Mr. Wu
for such a trivial thing.

00:39:33.074 --> 00:39:34.474
Sit down first.

00:39:35.594 --> 00:39:36.355
Sit down.

00:39:41.315 --> 00:39:41.954
Well,

00:39:42.634 --> 00:39:44.994
I'll provide 20 unskilled worker quotas
for the village.

00:39:46.554 --> 00:39:49.114
Swapping skilled worker quotas
for unskilled ones? No way.

00:39:49.395 --> 00:39:51.554
Unskilled workers are for manual work.

00:39:51.875 --> 00:39:53.355
Skilled workers learn a trade.

00:39:53.474 --> 00:39:53.974
Exactly!

00:39:54.395 --> 00:39:56.074
How can you make it sound so simple?

00:39:57.994 --> 00:40:00.634
Ms. Li, to be honest.

00:40:01.154 --> 00:40:02.554
I regret coming here.

00:40:03.034 --> 00:40:04.755
The county issued a directive,

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.434
telling us state-owned factories
to support Yuehai's construction.

00:40:07.434 --> 00:40:09.074
That's why we moved to this place.

00:40:09.355 --> 00:40:10.795
And the result?

00:40:11.034 --> 00:40:12.275
The output doesn't increase.

00:40:12.795 --> 00:40:14.994
But our shipping costs have doubled.

00:40:16.315 --> 00:40:19.474
We state-owned factories are responsible
for our own profits and losses now.

00:40:20.235 --> 00:40:22.675
Ms. Li, forget about
adding more staff positions.

00:40:22.875 --> 00:40:24.554
I wish to cut a few staff positions.

00:40:25.154 --> 00:40:27.315
Mr. Zhang, you can't say that.

00:40:27.755 --> 00:40:30.034
Ten state-owned factories
moved to Yuehai.

00:40:30.275 --> 00:40:33.195
Nine of them saw
varying levels of profit increase.

00:40:33.554 --> 00:40:35.514
Only your cable factory's profits
are falling.

00:40:35.994 --> 00:40:36.915
I wonder

00:40:37.275 --> 00:40:39.074
if it's the problem with Yuehai,

00:40:39.315 --> 00:40:40.395
or your cable factory's

00:40:40.594 --> 00:40:42.474
management and operations?

00:40:42.795 --> 00:40:43.474
Ms. Li,

00:40:44.954 --> 00:40:46.315
don't try to trick me.

00:40:46.835 --> 00:40:48.554
I'm telling you, I won't buy that.

00:40:48.875 --> 00:40:50.875
How about this?
You'd talk to the leadership

00:40:51.395 --> 00:40:52.875
to let us move the cable factory back

00:40:53.275 --> 00:40:55.875
and give this Yuehai land
back to the villagers, okay?

00:40:56.594 --> 00:40:57.154
Okay.

00:40:58.275 --> 00:41:00.114
Wait, what do you mean?

00:41:00.355 --> 00:41:01.074
Mr. Zhang.

00:41:01.514 --> 00:41:05.154
These quotas were approved
by the County Committee and Government.

00:41:05.634 --> 00:41:07.554
Want to return the land? Fine.

00:41:07.634 --> 00:41:10.355
We'll go to see
Mr. Zhao and Mr. Xia together.

00:41:11.554 --> 00:41:13.554
If they agree, I'll let you return it.

00:41:13.954 --> 00:41:16.875
Ms. Li, don't try to pressure me
with the leadership.

00:41:17.554 --> 00:41:18.715
Our factory isn't doing well.

00:41:19.474 --> 00:41:21.074
Many workers are unhappy.

00:41:21.875 --> 00:41:23.195
If I give away more quotas now

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:25.074
and the workers complain,

00:41:25.395 --> 00:41:26.474
no one could handle it.

00:41:27.474 --> 00:41:30.074
Mr. Zhang, don't try to pressure me
with the workers.

00:41:30.514 --> 00:41:33.034
I won't leave
until this issue is resolved.

00:41:37.315 --> 00:41:38.755
- I...
- Your old problem's acting up.

00:41:38.755 --> 00:41:39.315
Hurry.

00:41:39.514 --> 00:41:40.395
Get my medicine.

00:41:44.114 --> 00:41:45.434
Stop pressuring Mr. Zhang.

00:41:45.695 --> 00:41:46.994
Because of this issue,

00:41:47.288 --> 00:41:49.624
his heart disease and high blood pressure
are acting up.

00:41:50.474 --> 00:41:51.795
Let me see what medicine it is.

00:41:53.275 --> 00:41:53.915
Let me see.

00:41:54.795 --> 00:41:57.594
Wang, did you grab the wrong one?
These are vitamins!

00:41:58.994 --> 00:41:59.594
My mistake.

00:41:59.755 --> 00:42:01.275
Let me see what medicine might work.

00:42:01.275 --> 00:42:02.034
No, wait.

00:42:02.534 --> 00:42:03.994
Wait.

00:42:06.875 --> 00:42:07.474
Feeling better.

00:42:08.275 --> 00:42:08.954
Better now.

00:42:11.154 --> 00:42:11.715
Better now?

00:42:13.715 --> 00:42:15.795
Mr. Zhang, let's get back
to the matter at hand.

00:42:16.355 --> 00:42:18.355
I'm not here to argue with you,

00:42:18.875 --> 00:42:20.954
but to solve the problem with you.

00:42:22.195 --> 00:42:23.994
Since your cable factory
moved to Yuehai,

00:42:24.715 --> 00:42:26.755
we town government have to intervene.

00:42:27.512 --> 00:42:29.720
You have no right to manage
the state-owned factories.

00:42:29.954 --> 00:42:30.994
You got me wrong.

00:42:31.434 --> 00:42:33.954
I mean, we have to provide assistance.

00:42:35.114 --> 00:42:35.715
What?

00:42:36.235 --> 00:42:38.154
I know that since your factory
moved to Yuehai,

00:42:38.355 --> 00:42:40.154
profits are thin
because of transport costs.

00:42:40.634 --> 00:42:43.114
But thin profits don't matter much.
With sound operations,

00:42:43.235 --> 00:42:45.235
smooth production,
and sufficient customers,

00:42:45.514 --> 00:42:46.795
the performance would improve.

00:42:47.355 --> 00:42:48.440
Easier said than done.

00:42:49.656 --> 00:42:52.474
Have you heard of Qian Changyuan,
Yuehai's sales king?

00:42:53.634 --> 00:42:54.235
Yes.

00:42:54.994 --> 00:42:57.875
That super-salesman
who can sell anything?

00:42:58.554 --> 00:43:01.195
I'll act as the intermediary
and introduce you to each other.
