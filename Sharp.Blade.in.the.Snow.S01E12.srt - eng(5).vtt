00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.320
It wasn't easy for me

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.650
to bring you back alive.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.360
Why don't you cherish it?

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.460
I wish you well, Your Majesty.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.080
If you haven't seen enough, Your Majesty,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.140
you can come closer

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.000
for a better look.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.720
Perhaps I should.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.160
You're someone

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.260
I can't quite see through.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.850
Why did you save Jiang Zimo?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.720
He works for you.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.160
Do you think I would believe

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.880
you saved him for my sake?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.840
Then how am I supposed to treat you?

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.079
It wasn't easy for me

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.960
to bring you back alive.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.490
If you don't believe me,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.120
I can

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.300
disappear from your sight

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.720
forever.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.600
The fire last night was huge,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.740
burning fiercely.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.420
At that moment,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.260
I was just thinking

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.760
that if Jiang Zimo died,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.980
you'd surely be heartbroken.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.360
I can't bear to see you

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.760
grieve over another man.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.290
If this was some ploy to gain sympathy,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.880
it worked.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.120
Does it hurt?

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.400
Your Majesty.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.120
Jiang Zimo is awake.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.930
I'll be right there.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.360
Guard Jiang has burns all over his body,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.480
and his throat has inhaled too much smoke.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.340
He's temporarily lost his voice.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.160
As long as he's alive.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.640
Can he still move?

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.440
Well...

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.079
Besides the burns on his body,

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.720
Guard Jiang also bears injuries
from torture.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.040
Right now, even moving a finger

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.840
is difficult for him.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.570
He'll need time to recuperate.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.200
That venomous woman Rao Jun—

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.520
letting her die like that

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.640
was too merciful.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.560
It's all my fault

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.490
that you ended up like this.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.580
Your Majesty, please don't blame yourself.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.839
The one who harmed him was Rao Jun,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.760
and whoever was behind her.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.880
Why are you here?

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.360
You took so long to come back.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.610
I'm also a patient who needs your care.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.160
Since you didn't come back to me,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.360
I had to come find you.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.640
What's wrong?

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.120
Are you in pain somewhere?

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.520
Perhaps his wounds are too painful.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.840
I'll brew some soothing medicine

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.080
to help him feel better.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.640
Okay.

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.960
Your Majesty.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.850
It seems Guard Jiang

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.360
isn't feeling well.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.060
Maybe we should go back

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.480
and leave him to rest.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.080
That's not a bad idea.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.280
Rest well.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.020
I'll come see you another day.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.400
Let's go.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.160
Let's go.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.040
You're awake.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.520
I've brought you some medicine.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.640
This medicine

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.320
should be taken while it's still warm.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.840
You're with them.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.020
Why did you save me?

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.400
I'm not taking

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.440
this medicine.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.280
I only saved you

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.810
because I didn't want her to be sad.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.520
Drink this.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.720
It's better for both of us

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.820
if you can't speak.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.440
Come on,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.690
open your mouth.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.370
Open your mouth!

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.580
Your Highness.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.360
Feng Li...

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.640
She's not what she seems.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.460
Your Highness, please be extra careful.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.520
Of course.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.520
She's my sister's child—

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.480
she carries the same blood as I do.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.720
She did…

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.000
Well.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.080
I...

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.200
I, Rao Jun,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.740
can't keep you company anymore, Sister.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.240
Rao Jun, you're the only one

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.640
who calls me sister.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.160
I'm very pleased.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.840
It's just...

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.000
I care for you,

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.780
so I want to release you from suffering
as soon as possible.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.680
Good girl.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.560
Rest in peace.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.760
You don't deserve to call me sister.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.820
Your Highness.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.760
What's this?

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.200
This is the key to the Queen's heart.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.600
Keep it safe.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.360
Li,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.680
you'll like my grand gift.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.490
Meng Wu, receive the imperial decree.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.520
Princess Royal's personal maid,

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.080
Rao Jun,

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.720
established illegal prisons,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.160
harmed loyal and upright officials,

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.560
and slaughtered the innocent.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.600
Her crimes are unforgivable
and deserve death.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.440
Princess Royal, Meng Wu, has failed to
govern those under her authority,

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.320
bringing disorder to the inner palace.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.330
She's hereby sentenced to
3 months of confinement.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:46.640
[Imperial Decree]

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.040
Without imperial summons,
she is not to leave her residence.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.000
Prime Minister Bai, you truly
deserve your reputation

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
as a veteran of three reigns,
even coming in person

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.680
for such a trivial matter
as delivering a decree.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.760
Without loyal officials like you,

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.480
Mocheng's foundation
would surely be shaken.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.520
I'm merely doing my duty.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.520
I'm just concerned for you.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.600
The imperial court is a perilous place.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.240
Do you truly believe that
clinging to these rules

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.560
will guarantee you
a lifetime of safety and honor?

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.360
I act justly and stand upright,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.320
with nothing to answer for
before heaven and earth.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.520
What is there to fear?

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.560
The shaman once divined

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.640
that Mocheng would one day
face a great calamity.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.520
I wonder

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.820
where this calamity will strike.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.920
Rao Jun's crimes are severe,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.400
and she's Your Highness's trusted maid.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.960
Her Majesty shows great virtue
in honoring familial bonds.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.890
I hope Your Highness can
choose your words with care.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:56.570
[Imperial Decree]

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.000
My dear Li,

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.000
you've truly grown capable.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.010
Now that you've given me
such a grand gift,

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.200
how should I properly repay you?

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.460
Lift your head.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.600
Your appearance is quite pleasing.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.080
Take him away!

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.920
Tonight, you'll learn

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.640
how to wag your tail.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.080
I'm merely a wanderer from the wasteland,

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.160
of lowly birth.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.520
I...

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.000
I'm unworthy to meet a noble gaze.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.160
Besides, my heart has long been
spoken for.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.480
You dare refuse me?

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.040
Then I'll rip

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.300
that heart of yours out

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.610
and see exactly whom it belongs to.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.040
Someone!

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.840
Strip him of his clothes!

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.400
So much for that pretty face—

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.120
turns out there's such an ugly scar
on his back.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:28.920
Indeed.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.680
All shine on the surface, decay within.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.000
My stone!

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.360
Trying to escape?

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.180
What's this worthless thing?

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.400
What a grand display.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.980
Greetings, Your Majesty!

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.320
Was stealing Aunt's slave
not enough for you?

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.760
Now you want to take the one

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.360
I've set my sights on as well?

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.160
If that's what I want,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.330
won't you let me have it?

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.040
Does it still hurt?

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.480
It's all my fault

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.400
for causing you to be left with

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.060
such a large, ugly scar

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.680
for the rest of your life.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.760
That's not true.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.560
Look—

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.220
doesn't it look just like
the moon in the sky?

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.680
That's really something, you know?

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.480
Perhaps one day,

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.960
I'll rise to the heavens
and become an immortal.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.920
And what if you just soar away?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.840
I'll grab you and take you with me.
