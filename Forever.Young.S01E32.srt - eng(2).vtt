00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:37.599
About Weiguo...

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.200
He doesn't seem right.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.239
What's wrong with him?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.079
He's wearing glasses.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.120
It's like the doctor said,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.439
something is pressing on his...

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:54.560
optic nerve.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.680
It's pressing on the optic nerve.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.400
So what do we do?

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.959
He won't even drink water.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.120
Won't answer when spoken to.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.240
We have to help him.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.719
Help him live to the end.

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.000
He needs to look like a person too.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.080
We mustn't let him think

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.000
we see him as a patient.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.639
Make him feel he's still a normal person.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.520
Well...

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.439
Then you gotta tell those two brothers.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.439
Talking about those two.

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.439
This one's hiding from trouble, right?

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.000
And the other says he's busy.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.879
Spoiled rotten.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.960
When you lecture me,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.240
you're full of big talk.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.240
But when trouble lands on *their* heads,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.439
They're useless.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.240
Every single one, they just can't handle it.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.400
They just need a good beating.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.240
Beat them? Can you even manage that now?

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:01.759
Same as before.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.960
If there's really no other way,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.840
then we'll do it my way.

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.000
Tomorrow at noon,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.400
everyone meet at Weiguo's place.

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:22.240
Anyone who doesn't show up...

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.840
don't call me Big Brother anymore.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.960
Hey, hey...

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.520
Don't be hasty.

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:45.560
Big Brother.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.439
Alright.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.439
So you all still recognize me as Big Brother?

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.680
You all came when I called.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.639
Big Bro, what's that for?

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.080
What do you think it's for?

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.280
You're serious?

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.919
Ow! That hurts!

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.479
Oh, you know what pain is now?

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.479
Look at yourselves now.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.919
Acting like you can't even go on living.

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:11.520
Right now,

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.039
Auntie is gone.

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.160
Uncle Tong isn't here anymore either.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.720
The older generation isn't around to look after you.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.959
Now I'm the eldest.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:23.800
Starting today,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.800
*I'll* look after you.

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:27.240
And I'll do it my way.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.600
Big Bro, I...

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.199
Shut your mouth!

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.279
It's not your turn yet.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.839
Second Brother, get over here.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.480
What for?

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.399
I'm hitting you, that's what for!

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.040
Why?!

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.160
Why?

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.680
I told you our brothers had a problem,

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.800
to come back and discuss it with me.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.839
You told me you were busy.

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:50.240
Busy with what?!

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.240
Is anything more important than our brothers?

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.040
Do I deserve to hit you?

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:57.399
Yes.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.480
You, come here.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.360
Sit your ass down there.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.600
Big Bro, actually...

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.720
Not your turn yet!

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.120
You shut your mouth!

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.600
Qiu'er, you come here.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.720
Know why I'm hitting you?

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.600
Yes.

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:30.639
Xiao Jia bullied you.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.759
And all you know is how to hide.

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.360
You hide from your mom.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.800
You hide from your wife.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.480
Where else you gonna hide?

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.399
Get over here!

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.360
Go sit over there.

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:53.160
Weiguo, you get over here.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.279
Bro, how about...

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:56.680
I take the beating for Weiguo.

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:58.560
I'll take Weiguo's beating, okay?

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:02.040
You take it for him? Can you really?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.800
Let's see you try.

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:05.519
Come here.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.480
Big Bro, I don't need it.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.240
I'm fine.

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:11.959
You pretend all day long that you're fine!

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.160
You think I can't see through you?

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.720
I'm not pretending. I really am fine now.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.120
I've decided to have the surgery.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.120
Really.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.920
I wanted to tell you as soon as you walked in,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.600
but you didn't give me a chance.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.759
You just started hitting people.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.360
You just needed a good whack, you know that?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.600
Big Bro, I was wrong.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.839
I admit it.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.519
Lately, my emotions have been all over the place.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.279
But I've really made up my mind.

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:47.240
I'm fully determined.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.319
I'm going to have this surgery.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.560
I just haven't had the chance yet

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.879
to tell all of you.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.839
Really, I've decided.

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:54.759
Don't be angry anymore.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.920
Okay?

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:01.120
Let's focus on the surgery.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.600
It's okay, Big Bro.

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:10.639
Alright then.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.240
Sit down, sit, just sit first.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.399
You sit down too.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.360
Second Brother.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.720
Third Brother.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.800
And me, your Big Brother.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.480
Qiu'er is our brother.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.360
He's been bullied.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.399
What should we do?

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.160
We deal with him.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.839
Let's go deal with him!

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:30.600
Let's go, go!

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.279
Qiu'er, you watch from the side. Let's go!

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:33.279
Go!

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:06.279
Where are you brothers off to?

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.240
You saw how pathetic Tong Qiu looked, right?

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:30.399
Hello, last four digits of your phone?

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:31.279
6066.

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:32.879
Okay, please fasten your seatbelt.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:09.840
Bro.

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:12.159
I'll go in alone. I can handle it.

00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:14.200
Okay?

00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:16.440
No problem.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.320
Jia Zhilong

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:32.440
What do you want?

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.840
Following me?

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:36.480
I want to have a proper talk with you.

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:38.080
What do we have to talk about?

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:42.159
I know it was you who reported me, right?

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.159
Can you go to the bank and explain

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:46.039
this matter clearly to everyone?

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.840
If you do that, then we can

00:09:48.159 --> 00:09:49.440
let bygones be bygones, okay?

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.519
Let bygones be bygones?

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:55.159
Can't make it out there anymore, huh?

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.279
Want to come back to the bank?

00:09:57.039 --> 00:09:57.559
Fine.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.120
Beg me.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.399
My word carries weight at the bank now.

00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:02.759
You beg me to put in a good word for you.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.279
Not convinced, are you?

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.080
Alright, hit me.

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:10.799
I don't dare.

00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:13.559
It's so simple.

00:10:13.559 --> 00:10:15.120
Either you beat me up,

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:16.519
or you beg me.

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:19.840
Qiu'er.

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:22.799
*You're* the one talking about letting bygones be bygones?

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:25.159
Here.

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:29.399
This video is you, right?

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.639
I'm not wronging you, am I?

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:34.360
*You* want to let bygones be bygones with *me*?

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:38.639
Beg me.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.200
Beg me.

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:52.120
You beg me to delete this video,

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:54.720
and then I'll go plead for you at the bank.

00:11:02.039 --> 00:11:03.440
Acting like a jerk, are you?

00:11:08.039 --> 00:11:09.559
Qiu'er, are you insane?

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:10.919
You believe I'll call the police?

00:11:10.919 --> 00:11:11.799
Go ahead, call them.

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:12.639
Call them.

00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:13.799
Hurry up and call.

00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:14.679
No phone, huh?

00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:15.559
Use mine to call.

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:17.320
Here, use mine to call.

00:11:18.159 --> 00:11:19.799
Explain everything clearly to the police.

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:21.399
Tell them exactly what's going on between us.

00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:22.440
Do you think I want to go back to that bank?

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.159
Let me tell you, I'm not going back!

00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:25.919
Come on, I'm telling you to call! Call!

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:26.679
No matter what,

00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:27.440
no matter what it takes,

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.799
I have to let everyone know everything.

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:29.159
Let me tell you,

00:11:29.159 --> 00:11:30.440
do you think I still want to work at the bank?

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.679
I quit!

00:11:31.679 --> 00:11:32.559
Call, hurry up!

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.399
Call, call, call!

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:42.440
I don't dare.

00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:44.639
I don't dare.

00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:49.960
I really overestimated you before.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.879
I kept giving you ground, step by step,

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:53.679
and you just kept pushing for more.

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:55.000
You just had to push your luck, didn't you?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.039
Now you don't dare.

00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:57.679
Afraid everyone will find out.

00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:00.559
Alright, no problem.

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:01.559
I'm telling you,

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:03.039
I'll go investigate and gather evidence.

00:12:03.039 --> 00:12:04.679
I will definitely submit this defense material.

00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:05.879
I'll find all the evidence.

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:07.159
Then you can figure out what to do.

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:11.519
I'll buy you three phones.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.000
What are you doing?

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:22.159
You think it's easy for me, don't you?

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:34.320
It's settled.

00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:36.399
I'm heading out first.

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:38.000
Where are you going?

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:40.679
To find Xiaoshi.

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:44.879
This guy.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.679
Leaving, huh?

00:14:30.279 --> 00:14:32.399
Maybe you think I can't see reality clearly,

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:39.519
but actually, I see things clearer than many.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.320
Between people,

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:46.399
between matters, between feelings,

00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:51.080
someone always has to make a concession.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.519
Honey.

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:57.120
I know I've let you down a lot over the years.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.039
I always hide in my own

00:15:00.039 --> 00:15:01.559
comfort zone.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.639
When I encounter problems, I hide.

00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:05.519
I hide from problems.

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:08.120
Hiding became a habit for me.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.159
You got used to it.

00:15:11.039 --> 00:15:12.720
Everyone got used to it.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.679
Sometimes, you know,

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.240
when I get drunk

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.519
and wake up the next morning,

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:23.000
I feel like

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:27.919
by hiding and hiding,

00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:30.799
I'm about to hide even my comfort zone away.

00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:33.720
So I just

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.639
lie flat.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.879
I become a pile of mud,

00:15:42.039 --> 00:15:43.159
letting people shape me however they want.

00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:45.159
Whatever shape they mold me into, that's what I am.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.120
And I'm okay with it.

00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:50.799
But after being molded and molded,

00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:52.879
I forgot what I used to be like.

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:54.759
I even forgot what I should be like now.

00:15:54.759 --> 00:15:55.879
What should I be like?

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.879
Tell me, what should I be like?

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.480
But I want to thank Big Brother.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.960
I want to thank you.

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:09.559
And I want to thank our baby.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.120
It's you who made me realize

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.720
it's time for me to be strong.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.399
It's time for me to change.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.600
It's time for me to have responsibility.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.480
Because I'm a father now.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.879
I'm a father now.

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:24.240
Wife, believe in me one more time.

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:26.200
This time, I will definitely do it myself.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.679
I'll personally mold myself,

00:16:27.679 --> 00:16:28.559
even if in the end I'm molded

00:16:28.559 --> 00:16:30.159
into a broken basin,

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:31.840
like a broken gourd,

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.440
I think I'll still have my own value.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.600
I'll have my own proper shape, and I accept it.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.000
I can't hide anymore.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.480
I absolutely will not hide anymore.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.879
In the past, I would

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.919
always feel tired,

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.200
want to escape,

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:54.720
not want to go on.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.759
So I wanted everyone to wait a bit longer.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.440
For you to wait.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.480
For myself to wait.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.319
But this time,

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.599
I don't want you to wait anymore.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.200
My transfer request has been approved.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.400
I'll be back in Beijing in a few days.

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:34.480
What about the director position?

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.759
I'll be promoted to director upon returning to Beijing.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.160
That's really well written.

00:18:27.079 --> 00:18:27.799
Without Manager Li,

00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:30.119
my Honeycomb Tech might have been done for long ago.

00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:31.880
During my most difficult time,

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.160
it was Old Li who lent a helping hand.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.559
He helped us get through the tough times.

00:18:35.759 --> 00:18:37.000
Of course, for Manager Li,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.039
this might have been just a small effort,

00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:40.599
but for Honeycomb Tech,

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.359
I don't know if this trick of yours

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.720
will actually work.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.200
Let's give it a try.

00:18:49.039 --> 00:18:49.920
He's not answering.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.759
Still not answering.

00:18:50.759 --> 00:18:52.000
Try calling again.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.200
Alright, stop calling.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.519
So this is the plan you came up with to talk me around?

00:19:07.359 --> 00:19:08.880
I was out of ideas.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.200
But you saw it.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.880
Your colleagues and partners,

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.880
they're all very grateful to you.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.640
Yeah.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.799
Lianbao, all these years,

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:19.920
you've been quietly looking after the brothers.

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:22.319
I, as your Big Brother, thank you.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.720
Second Brother.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.880
All these years, you've always

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.119
always taken care of me.

00:19:28.279 --> 00:19:29.400
And my dad and mom,

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.039
they've also received your care.

00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:32.279
Your little brother thanks you.

00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:36.240
Lianbao, when my dad passed,

00:19:37.079 --> 00:19:38.880
you were the one who helped me through it.

00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:40.960
All these years, I've owed you a thank you.

00:19:42.039 --> 00:19:43.000
Thank you, Second Brother.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.000
Thank you.

00:19:44.759 --> 00:19:46.160
Actually, you're already very successful.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.359
You don't need to prove anything more.

00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:48.000
Yeah.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.279
It's too late.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.039
I've already met with Kevin.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.119
I still don't get what you mean.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.680
Isn't it simple enough to understand?

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.440
I admit defeat.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.240
You'd actually admit defeat?

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.000
Lao Kai.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.119
Don't think just because your Chinese is okay,

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.799
you actually understand the Chinese spirit.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.000
I admit,

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.279
my ability right now is indeed inferior to yours.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.960
But I can learn again.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.160
When I've grown stronger in the future,

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.519
I'll take back what belongs to me.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.000
It's just Ah Q spirit.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.359
Spiritual victory.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.359
No matter what you say,

00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:28.920
I've already let go of some things now.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:30.799
Oh, right.

00:20:31.119 --> 00:20:31.960
And Yuanyuan.

00:20:32.599 --> 00:20:34.880
I absolutely will not agree to her emigrating now.

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:37.200
When she wants to go in the future,

00:20:37.599 --> 00:20:38.519
I'll go with her.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.119
Aren't you just trying to scare people? That's what you're doing.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.440
You guys don't know,

00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:50.759
the other day I almost lost Yuanyuan.

00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:53.400
It scared me to death.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.519
Afterwards, I started thinking,

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.720
with all the trouble I've been causing,

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.119
was it really for Yuanyuan,

00:20:57.119 --> 00:20:59.759
or was I just using Yuanyuan as an excuse?

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:01.680
Now I understand.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.279
Causing all that mess,

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.000
and even neglecting Yuanyuan...

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.640
I'm just a total jerk.

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:08.640
Don't talk about yourself like that.

00:21:08.799 --> 00:21:11.279
As long as you've realized it now,

00:21:11.799 --> 00:21:13.720
then you're still a good dad.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.480
That video was filmed by Qianqian, you know.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.799
You should at least show some appreciation.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.039
Thank you.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.880
Perfect timing.

00:21:25.759 --> 00:21:27.400
Come outside, I need to talk to you.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.440
No, no, no.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.039
Let's go outside.

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:29.720
Let's go outside.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.279
Let's go outside.

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:31.200
Excuse us.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.160
I was actually planning to find you today.

00:21:46.359 --> 00:21:47.440
What for?

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.960
I really did write you a love letter back then.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.160
I just didn't have the courage to give it to you.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.640
Let me read it to you.

00:22:03.519 --> 00:22:04.680
Dear Qianqian,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
I like you.

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:08.160
I believe you like me too.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.519
Alright, alright, stop reading it.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.920
I'm getting goosebumps listening to this.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.160
Just keep listening.

00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:18.160
When you were little, you were like a tomboy,

00:22:18.359 --> 00:22:19.720
not cute at all.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.240
You were also very proud,

00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:22.519
pretentiously aloof.

00:22:22.599 --> 00:22:24.519
Coming first in every exam,

00:22:24.519 --> 00:22:25.880
really annoying.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.200
Is this a love letter you're writing,

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.359
or are you insulting me?

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.920
Don't be impatient.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.440
There's a big twist coming right up.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.039
Later, I discovered you were very smart and driven,

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.400
understanding and considerate,

00:22:38.799 --> 00:22:40.200
and I became captivated by you.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.680
I wanted to confess to you

00:22:42.759 --> 00:22:43.960
when I scored higher than you on a test.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.640
Sadly, I never managed to beat you.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.559
The enemy was too strong.

00:22:49.599 --> 00:22:50.720
Then later,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.240
we were both set for direct admission to Beihang University.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.759
I was so excited.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.240
I kept thinking,

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.359
on the day we stepped into Beihang's campus,

00:22:58.359 --> 00:22:59.680
I would loudly tell you,

00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:00.920
I like you.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.680
Later, the direct admission didn't work out.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.640
I was too embarrassed to give you this letter anymore.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.480
Let me see, is that how it's written?

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.359
You aged this stationery yourself?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.359
Pretty impressive.

00:23:23.119 --> 00:23:25.720
No, you have no idea how much effort that took.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.960
Look, before, I was wrong.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.440
My attitude was bad when you tried to advise me.

00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:37.440
And that matter with Manager Luo, I overstepped.

00:23:37.799 --> 00:23:39.680
I should have trusted your professional ability.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.039
From now on, I'll follow your pace.

00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:44.759
I promise not to make you angry.

00:23:47.799 --> 00:23:49.279
Give me another chance.

00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:50.880
I can't miss out on you again.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.119
Okay.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.039
If you don't agree,

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.079
I'll understand.

00:24:01.599 --> 00:24:04.240
I promise I won't bother you anymore in the future.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.079
What's this?

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:16.160
You're giving up already?

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.519
I'm just teasing you.

00:24:19.519 --> 00:24:22.400
I knew you still cared about me.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.480
What?

00:24:23.519 --> 00:24:25.440
I'm telling you, it's not as simple as you think.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.000
I still need to observe you some more.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.759
Fine.

00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:29.960
You can take your time observing me for the rest of my life.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.440
Let go.

00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:43.079
You're so annoying.

00:24:55.799 --> 00:24:57.119
This one is way too ugly.

00:24:58.319 --> 00:24:59.559
You scared me.

00:25:02.119 --> 00:25:03.079
So, what do you think?

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.400
A face that could launch a thousand ships, right?

00:25:06.319 --> 00:25:08.000
That's just a rumor going around.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.960
I've thought it through.

00:25:15.119 --> 00:25:16.599
Being a carpenter isn't right for me.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.279
Let's plant flowers together.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.599
Sunflowers?

00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:26.640
Sure.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.200
I told you before.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.400
Whatever you want to do in the future,

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.519
I'll be there with you.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.640
But...

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.799
Could we plant a different kind of flower?

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.480
Because sunflowers take way too long to bloom.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.400
No matter when they bloom,

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.960
we can wait for them slowly.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.440
Will you wait for the flowers with me?

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:55.920
I will.

00:25:58.039 --> 00:25:58.799
Thank you.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.960
Food's here!

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.720
Smells amazing.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.720
This is a feast.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.440
Duck's here!

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.240
Drinks are here!

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.200
Put the drinks on the table.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:13.920
Got it.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:14.920
Dad, I'm getting up now.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.480
Alright, thanks for the hard work, kid.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.440
Where's Weiguo?

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.400
Coming!

00:26:19.519 --> 00:26:20.359
Coming!

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.200
I bought soda for everyone.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:23.960
This...

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.720
You silly kid.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.200
What are you all...

00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:27.440
Second Brother, drink, drink, drink!

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.119
Come on, come on.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.200
Fine, I won't say a word.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.599
That's more like it.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.119
Bro.

00:26:34.119 --> 00:26:34.720
Here, Qiu'er.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.720
Qiu'er, give Shishi the soda to drink.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.640
Sure thing.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.960
Got a bottle opener?

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.599
Here you go, Qiu'er.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.200
Thanks, bro. Thanks.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.039
Wife.

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:45.720
Wife.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.119
Second Brother and Second Sister-in-law should also make a toast.

00:26:51.119 --> 00:26:52.720
Hold on, Second Brother and who?

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.279
Second Brother and Second Sister-in-law.

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.599
Second Sister-in-law.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.880
Alright.

00:26:58.039 --> 00:26:59.799
Later, Qianqian and I will do a linked-arm toast.

00:26:59.799 --> 00:27:00.440
Okay?

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.359
Okay.

00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:03.039
Who's doing a linked-arm toast with you?

00:27:03.599 --> 00:27:04.160
Oh, right.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.440
There's something I want to announce to everyone.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.400
I've decided to have the surgery.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.599
In the next couple of days.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.359
Come on.

00:27:15.519 --> 00:27:16.359
Come on.

00:27:16.359 --> 00:27:17.440
Let's have a toast.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.359
Come on, everyone.

00:27:18.359 --> 00:27:18.880
Here.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.279
Come on, let's all raise our glasses.

00:27:20.279 --> 00:27:21.720
Come on, come on.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.599
Smooth sailing.

00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:23.480
Smooth sailing.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.720
Smooth sailing, smooth sailing.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.960
I especially want to thank Tongtong.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.319
She's the one who gave me the courage.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.599
Saying that...

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.200
Just being polite for show.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:36.759
Cheers.

00:27:36.839 --> 00:27:37.440
So sweet.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.200
Thank you.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.039
Really...

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.160
Hey, Qiu'er, Xiaoshi.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.680
Wishing you smooth sailing too.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.160
Thanks, bro.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:43.759
Thank you, Big Brother.

00:27:43.759 --> 00:27:44.799
Come on, come on, all together.

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:46.119
Come on, together.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.519
May everyone get better and better.

00:27:47.519 --> 00:27:50.480
Better and better.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.599
Hey, Feifei, you better study hard for your exams.

00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:53.119
Okay.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.000
Well then, I'll have one.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.279
Less, pour less.

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:58.400
Someone's eager to drink, huh?

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.799
That's right, Sister-in-law, let me tell you.

00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:02.960
You are so right.

00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:04.799
Come on, come on, drink up!

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:05.559
Yes, yes, yes.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.720
Hey, Big Brother,

00:28:15.839 --> 00:28:17.319
you're not holding up well today.

00:28:21.319 --> 00:28:22.079
Qiu'er!

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.440
You let it slip.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.200
What's wrong with you, Tong Qiu?

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.200
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.799
Everyone has their own life.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.480
Let me tell you,

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.599
Big Brother just threw up the drink again.

00:28:38.599 --> 00:28:40.039
Don't drink with him anymore.

00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:40.960
Stop drinking.

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:42.680
He'll puke on your faces in a minute.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.359
Big Brother can't keep track over there.

00:28:55.039 --> 00:28:56.759
Big Brother, don't fall asleep. Come on.

00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:57.799
Chunsheng.

00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:00.079
Hurry up and control Qianqian.

00:29:06.359 --> 00:29:08.079
Since everyone's here, let's take a photo, okay?

00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:08.920
Okay, okay, okay.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.160
Let's all go over there.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.519
You organize everyone.

00:29:15.519 --> 00:29:16.359
Big Brother, you should sit down.

00:29:16.359 --> 00:29:17.039
Maybe you should just sit.

00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:18.160
Bro, sit down.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.799
Okay, Big Brother?

00:29:21.119 --> 00:29:22.200
Weiguo.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:22.759
Here.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.279
One, two.

00:29:26.279 --> 00:29:27.759
Actually, actually, just act natural.

00:29:27.759 --> 00:29:28.799
I'm just taking candid shots.

00:29:31.359 --> 00:29:32.359
Two.

00:29:32.359 --> 00:29:33.039
Three.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.640
What are you sighing about?

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.559
Here, take it slow.

00:29:58.359 --> 00:29:59.559
He might even need craniotomy.

00:29:59.559 --> 00:30:00.240
You know what?

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.160
He's out.

00:30:01.559 --> 00:30:02.480
Weiguo.

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:04.160
Relax, it's okay.

00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:05.599
Don't worry.

00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:06.400
Don't you worry.

00:30:06.599 --> 00:30:08.160
Good people have heaven's favor.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.480
Yes, yes, yes.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.480
It's fine.

00:30:11.559 --> 00:30:12.319
Get in the car.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.039
Once he's treated, he'll be back.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.160
We'll all be waiting for you.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:17.960
Waiting for you to come back.

00:30:18.359 --> 00:30:19.319
Take it easy now.

00:30:19.319 --> 00:30:20.319
Easy does it.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.039
Don't you fret.

00:30:24.359 --> 00:30:25.319
Weiguo.

00:30:25.839 --> 00:30:27.000
Don't worry.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.640
Everything's alright.

00:30:29.359 --> 00:30:30.440
Just take it easy, okay?

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:53.720
The soup.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.240
We forgot the soup.

00:31:38.599 --> 00:31:40.319
Family, please wait outside.

00:32:08.079 --> 00:32:08.799
Mom.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:09.960
I'm back.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.599
Honey.

00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:13.000
Making dumplings today.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.799
Don't trouble yourself, I'll do it.

00:32:24.839 --> 00:32:25.759
Smells good, right?

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.240
Mom's filling is so fragrant.

00:32:32.519 --> 00:32:33.640
Pork and chives.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:39.839
Mom.

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:41.880
I need to tell you something.

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:43.920
My, uh...

00:32:44.599 --> 00:32:46.319
My appeal materials were confirmed.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.640
They want me back at the bank.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.519
That's wonderful news!

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.559
Well, that misunderstanding is cleared up.

00:32:57.559 --> 00:32:59.359
And the knot in my heart is finally undone.

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:01.039
But I'm not planning to go back.

00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:04.880
Why on earth not?

00:33:05.559 --> 00:33:07.079
I've talked it over with Xiaoshi.

00:33:07.359 --> 00:33:09.480
I want to finish writing my dad's script.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.279
About my dad's script...

00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:14.400
I don't want it to be left unfinished.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.599
Don't you think so?

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.240
But if you don't go back to the bank...

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.519
Is that really okay?

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.359
Mom.

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:26.519
Qiu'er was always pushed along by others.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.920
He never truly did what he wanted.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.960
Now he's figured it out.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.799
What he loved most as a kid was telling stories.

00:33:35.839 --> 00:33:38.279
Let him take up Dad's mantle and write properly.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.400
If your dad knew you were like this...

00:33:52.839 --> 00:33:54.440
He'd be at peace too.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.319
Look at you, talking and then...

00:33:58.319 --> 00:33:59.880
Getting all emotional.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.839
This is a good thing, Mom.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.839
Right?

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:05.680
Isn't it?

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:12.719
Here, Xuanxuan.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.599
This one, this one, this one's big!

00:34:16.599 --> 00:34:17.599
It flew! It flew!

00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:20.239
A few years back, Old Ma led a team to develop...

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:23.440
Motion capture and image tracking tech.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.519
Recently, we made some improvements.

00:34:25.519 --> 00:34:27.639
Quickly developed a product with lower cost...

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.559
And higher precision.

00:34:29.559 --> 00:34:31.559
Cooperated with agriculture ministries worldwide...

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:33.800
And snatched a huge chunk of Kevin's orders.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:37.199
Kevin's having a tough time now.

00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:38.599
He's already agreed...

00:34:38.599 --> 00:34:40.920
To buy back Penglexuan's shares at the original price.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.360
And he keeps begging me...

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.079
To act as a bridge for you all.

00:34:45.079 --> 00:34:46.199
He's behaving now.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.159
Here it is! Here! Here!

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.679
Daddy, come play with us!

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:53.039
Come on!

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.320
Coming!

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.760
I gotta go.

00:34:58.039 --> 00:34:59.039
Didn't shake any out.

00:34:59.159 --> 00:35:00.440
None came out.

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:04.679
I want to poke it! Poke!

00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:05.480
Don't you hold it!

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.599
You can blow bubbles!

00:35:06.599 --> 00:35:08.440
Let Uncle make you lots and lots.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.599
So many!

00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:10.920
So very many!

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.920
There's no wind now.

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:16.639
Do you even know how?

00:35:23.159 --> 00:35:24.599
You got it all over your head.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.119
*With bamboo staff and straw sandals, lighter than a horse...*

00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:38.840
*In the scent of rice blossoms, we speak of a bountiful year.*

00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:43.760
*This period of time will be deeply etched in my heart.*

00:35:44.639 --> 00:35:45.719
*Here,*

00:35:46.159 --> 00:35:48.639
*I touched the most ordinary,*

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.800
Yet most vivid, the fireworks of human life.

00:35:51.239 --> 00:35:53.320
*I met the most genuine,*

00:35:53.559 --> 00:35:55.360
*And most sincere friendships in the world.*

00:36:11.559 --> 00:36:15.079
*I've seen the cowardly who still choose courage,*

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.840
*Answering the distant call with their footsteps.*

00:36:19.679 --> 00:36:21.079
*He chooses bravery,*

00:36:21.559 --> 00:36:22.880
*Not because fear is gone,*

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.840
*But by carrying that clear,*

00:36:26.039 --> 00:36:27.599
*Trembling fear,*

00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:29.519
*Step by step,*

00:36:29.679 --> 00:36:30.960
*Walking towards a self,*

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.559
*And a distant place never before reached.*

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.400
*I've seen those bearing heavy burdens,*

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.000
*Yet walking with calm composure,*

00:37:20.679 --> 00:37:24.119
*Gently reconciling with their ordinary selves in their stubbornness.*

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.960
*He too once resented the ordinariness of fate,*

00:37:27.039 --> 00:37:29.679
*Wanting to live as someone extraordinary in others' eyes.*

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.840
*Until one dusk,*

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.199
*He finally understood,*

00:37:33.639 --> 00:37:34.960
*That true reconciliation*

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.199
*Is not surrender,*

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.519
*But seeing clearly one's own limits,*

00:37:38.679 --> 00:37:39.960
*And then gently*

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.679
*Embracing that imperfect self.*

00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:46.880
*I've seen those with eternally blazing eyes,*

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.280
*Full of energy,*

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.119
*Becoming a shore others can lean on.*

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.320
*Their palms*

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.760
*May not always be warm,*

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.039
*Yet always, at the crucial moment,*

00:37:57.039 --> 00:37:58.880
*Offer the most solid strength.*

00:38:12.199 --> 00:38:13.599
From them

00:38:13.679 --> 00:38:16.199
I glimpsed life's truest, grandest expanse

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.960
The greatest endeavor in this world

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.719
is none other than living well

00:38:21.159 --> 00:38:22.400
Living bravely

00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:23.840
Living diligently

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.559
Eyes fixed straight ahead toward life's end

00:38:27.559 --> 00:38:28.960
and rushing toward it with abandon

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.840
Thus

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.039
I feel a happiness like never before

00:38:33.719 --> 00:38:35.079
This happiness

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:37.960
comes not just from the fullness of each second lived

00:38:38.559 --> 00:38:40.320
but more so because within my life

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.840
now resides a lasting hope

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.480
a person worth waiting for

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.360
See you tomorrow

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.320
See you tomorrow

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.800
What now?

00:38:53.239 --> 00:38:54.960
Weren't you going to see the doctor?

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.719
I'm not going

00:39:00.639 --> 00:39:01.960
Why won't you give up?

00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:56.320
If you're still alive

00:39:57.239 --> 00:39:58.559
If you can wake up

00:39:59.559 --> 00:40:01.039
If you've forgotten everything

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.239
then you must remember these few things

00:40:05.559 --> 00:40:06.760
Never underestimate a man

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.320
who reeks of duck grease

00:40:09.519 --> 00:40:11.000
Because within that smell of duck grease

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.719
lies

00:40:12.519 --> 00:40:13.760
not just the responsibilities of a father

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.400
a husband

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.920
and a Big Brother

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.800
but also the dream and tenacity

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.159
to make a roast duck soar to the sky

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.079
Never mock a single father with a daughter

00:40:25.159 --> 00:40:27.239
because he'll do something even crazier

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.960
until you shut up

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.239
Never let a fence-sitting yes-man

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.920
grow into a great tree

00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:37.079
because when the storm comes

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.239
he's tougher than any tree

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.559
Remember

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.199
the wooden frame's dimensions are

00:40:43.199 --> 00:40:44.599
thirty-six by forty-six

00:40:45.239 --> 00:40:46.480
Don't ask why

00:40:47.199 --> 00:40:49.239
because a female artist once said

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.039
"Negative space is eternal"

00:40:52.519 --> 00:40:54.280
And there's a reckless boy

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.840
remember not to teach him how to do things

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.840
because the choices he makes himself

00:40:59.079 --> 00:41:00.559
are far more correct than yours

00:41:02.679 --> 00:41:03.400
Oh, right

00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:06.880
If you see an old screenwriter with a worried face

00:41:07.559 --> 00:41:08.719
remember to tell him

00:41:09.639 --> 00:41:11.840
there's a mission we shouldn't forget

00:41:12.599 --> 00:41:14.000
To be born human

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.960
is not to endure suffering and misfortune

00:41:17.559 --> 00:41:18.920
but to seek happiness
