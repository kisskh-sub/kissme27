00:01:40.114 --> 00:01:42.034
I want to apologize

00:01:42.153 --> 00:01:45.593
to all cadres and families
who came to build homes

00:01:46.754 --> 00:01:47.313
in Yuehai.

00:01:52.658 --> 00:01:53.688
(He bows first.)

00:02:13.873 --> 00:02:14.633
At first,

00:02:15.913 --> 00:02:19.794
it was me begging the county cadres
to build homes in Yuehai.

00:02:20.593 --> 00:02:22.713
Because Yuehai's development
had hit a bottleneck.

00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:24.313
I thought

00:02:25.153 --> 00:02:27.873
if the cadres could come
to Yuehai to build homes,

00:02:28.394 --> 00:02:30.994
firstly, it would increase
Yuehai's population,

00:02:31.913 --> 00:02:34.834
and secondly, it would serve
as great publicity,

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:38.033
attracting more people
to build homes in Yuehai.

00:02:38.954 --> 00:02:40.794
So we reached an agreement quickly,

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:42.274
signed a letter of intent,

00:02:42.713 --> 00:02:44.554
and decided to allocate
Yuehai's Binhai Road

00:02:45.193 --> 00:02:46.433
to cadres for building homes.

00:02:46.794 --> 00:02:47.433
Mr. Zheng,

00:02:47.753 --> 00:02:48.674
since you knew this,

00:02:48.873 --> 00:02:52.593
why did you secretly give Binhai Road
to the self-employed individuals?

00:02:53.234 --> 00:02:54.033
Mr. Zheng,

00:02:54.713 --> 00:02:56.713
did you take money
from self-employed individuals?

00:02:56.913 --> 00:02:58.193
Yeah! Did you take money?

00:02:59.193 --> 00:03:00.033
Yeah, you took money!

00:03:00.193 --> 00:03:00.954
Did you take money?

00:03:02.153 --> 00:03:03.514
Give us an explanation!

00:03:03.753 --> 00:03:04.674
You took money, right?

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:06.033
Did they pay you?

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:08.473
Are you even a cadre?

00:03:08.674 --> 00:03:10.033
Quiet!

00:03:10.994 --> 00:03:11.954
We are in a meeting now.

00:03:12.473 --> 00:03:13.913
Please be serious!

00:03:14.234 --> 00:03:15.274
If you have any questions,

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:19.674
raise your hand and ask
after Zheng Decheng finishes.

00:03:20.994 --> 00:03:22.153
Maintain order!

00:03:23.354 --> 00:03:24.834
I-It's okay, Guan.

00:03:25.274 --> 00:03:28.313
I came to apologize today.

00:03:28.794 --> 00:03:30.074
So, everyone,

00:03:30.554 --> 00:03:32.674
if you have doubts or questions,

00:03:32.994 --> 00:03:34.033
I should answer them.

00:03:34.674 --> 00:03:35.433
It's just

00:03:35.713 --> 00:03:37.514
that there are far
too many people here today.

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:40.153
So if you all ask at once,

00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:43.554
my head is buzzing.
I-I can't hear clearly.

00:03:43.794 --> 00:03:44.873
I can't keep up.

00:03:45.354 --> 00:03:46.193
So if...

00:03:46.193 --> 00:03:48.074
Meng, make a call
at the government office.

00:03:48.313 --> 00:03:50.394
Read the content above word for word.

00:03:50.794 --> 00:03:51.473
Okay?

00:03:51.873 --> 00:03:52.554
Excuse me.

00:03:52.554 --> 00:03:53.394
Let me through.

00:03:53.394 --> 00:03:54.074
Otherwise,

00:03:54.193 --> 00:03:56.554
w-whoever has a question can ask first.

00:03:57.234 --> 00:03:58.153
I have a question.

00:03:58.226 --> 00:04:00.477
(Gatehouse)

00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:09.033
Sir, can I borrow your phone?

00:04:09.413 --> 00:04:09.913
Go ahead.

00:04:09.913 --> 00:04:10.473
Thanks.

00:04:18.794 --> 00:04:19.674
I'm here.

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:22.633
Okay, Meng, go ahead. I'll take notes.

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:27.234
Read.

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:27.734
Okay.

00:04:28.114 --> 00:04:28.953
It's been proofread?

00:04:29.313 --> 00:04:29.873
Word for word.

00:04:29.873 --> 00:04:30.433
Okay.

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:34.714
Sound is working now.

00:04:35.633 --> 00:04:36.794
(Super Dog Restaurant)
Residents of Yuehai Town.

00:04:36.794 --> 00:04:37.714
That's Mr. Tan's voice.

00:04:37.714 --> 00:04:38.273
Attention.

00:04:38.953 --> 00:04:42.273
Mr. Zheng is currently at the county,

00:04:42.594 --> 00:04:45.073
facing over 1,000 county cadres.

00:04:45.354 --> 00:04:47.714
(Limin Restaurant)
He is apologizing.

00:04:49.234 --> 00:04:51.794
Next, I will inform everyone

00:04:52.073 --> 00:04:53.594
about the situation with Mr. Zheng.

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:57.714
Facing over 1,000 county cadres,

00:04:59.114 --> 00:05:01.753
Mr. Zheng first bowed deeply,

00:05:02.794 --> 00:05:05.234
and said, "Hello, everyone."

00:05:05.753 --> 00:05:07.714
"I am Zheng Decheng, the man you call

00:05:08.313 --> 00:05:12.354
(Yuehai Town People's Government)
the biggest fool in Pingchuan County."

00:05:12.664 --> 00:05:13.914
My question is still the same.

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:16.433
Zheng Decheng, did you get money
from self-employed individuals?

00:05:17.513 --> 00:05:18.073
I did not.

00:05:19.034 --> 00:05:19.873
Any other questions?

00:05:20.433 --> 00:05:20.994
No.

00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:23.714
What question is Mr. Zheng on?

00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:25.272
The fifth one.

00:05:25.594 --> 00:05:29.313
Zheng Decheng, do you know
you were wrong? Do you regret it?

00:05:31.073 --> 00:05:32.073
What question is that?

00:05:32.594 --> 00:05:35.393
I know I was wrong,
but I have no regrets.

00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:36.674
Who else?

00:05:37.994 --> 00:05:38.494
Me.

00:05:43.313 --> 00:05:45.873
Mr. Zheng, I have a question for you.

00:05:46.953 --> 00:05:49.154
You signed a letter of intent
with us cadres,

00:05:49.513 --> 00:05:52.354
so why was Binhai Road given
to others and not us?

00:05:52.594 --> 00:05:54.154
This breaks the law, you know?

00:05:55.753 --> 00:05:56.594
Mr. Cai, right?

00:05:57.633 --> 00:06:00.034
Sorry, I-I can't see clearly from here.

00:06:01.914 --> 00:06:04.513
Actually, I've already
answered your question earlier.

00:06:04.953 --> 00:06:06.674
It is true
that I violated the agreement.

00:06:07.114 --> 00:06:09.034
I broke my word and acted arbitrarily.

00:06:09.433 --> 00:06:12.674
It was my oversight.
The authorities have disciplined me.

00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:15.633
Regarding whether this is illegal,

00:06:15.994 --> 00:06:16.994
I truly don't know.

00:06:17.433 --> 00:06:19.034
That's not for you to decide.

00:06:19.474 --> 00:06:22.433
This requires further investigation
and judgment by the authorities.

00:06:24.154 --> 00:06:24.914
Any other question?

00:06:25.433 --> 00:06:26.073
Yes.

00:06:27.273 --> 00:06:28.554
The discipline is only for you,

00:06:29.234 --> 00:06:30.554
but your personal issues

00:06:30.953 --> 00:06:34.234
have caused emotional harm
and mental anguish to us cadres.

00:06:34.873 --> 00:06:36.234
H-How about the compensation?

00:06:36.714 --> 00:06:37.976
Yes! How's the compensation?

00:06:37.976 --> 00:06:39.224
- Yes.
- How's the compensation?

00:06:39.224 --> 00:06:40.120
Distress compensation!

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.824
Can't let it go!

00:06:40.824 --> 00:06:41.496
Explain!

00:06:41.496 --> 00:06:42.488
How's the compensation?

00:06:42.776 --> 00:06:43.674
Is there a plan yet?

00:06:46.753 --> 00:06:47.594
Here's the thing.

00:06:48.873 --> 00:06:53.433
We've constructed Xingfu Road
adjacent to Binhai Road.

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:56.873
Its length and area

00:06:57.273 --> 00:06:58.794
are identical to Binhai Road's.

00:06:59.154 --> 00:07:00.994
Our Yuehai cadres

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:03.433
are already working overtime on it.

00:07:03.953 --> 00:07:04.794
Three months at most.

00:07:05.234 --> 00:07:07.794
We'll certainly deliver Xingfu Road
to you in three months.

00:07:08.433 --> 00:07:09.994
Three months?

00:07:13.313 --> 00:07:14.753
We have to wait three whole months?

00:07:14.953 --> 00:07:15.554
Three months?

00:07:16.313 --> 00:07:17.034
How absurd.

00:07:17.313 --> 00:07:18.313
Quit bluffing!

00:07:19.633 --> 00:07:20.914
G-Go implement this!

00:07:23.554 --> 00:07:25.714
Mr. Cai, do you have further questions?

00:07:26.633 --> 00:07:29.633
We don't want Xingfu Road!
We demand Binhai Road!

00:07:30.193 --> 00:07:32.433
If they're identical as you claim,

00:07:33.073 --> 00:07:34.794
why don't
self-employed individuals want it?

00:07:35.114 --> 00:07:36.794
Why should we cadres suffer this loss?

00:07:37.633 --> 00:07:38.273
Mr. Cai,

00:07:38.914 --> 00:07:40.794
before addressing your question,

00:07:41.474 --> 00:07:42.953
let me ask you one.

00:07:43.914 --> 00:07:46.794
Why did cadres come
to build homes in Yuehai?

00:07:47.594 --> 00:07:49.114
Why insist on Binhai Road?

00:07:49.674 --> 00:07:51.794
D-Don't dodge the question.

00:07:52.393 --> 00:07:54.914
Everyone here knows the answer.

00:07:56.034 --> 00:07:56.534
Right?

00:07:56.594 --> 00:07:57.554
We reject Xingfu Road!

00:07:57.753 --> 00:07:58.594
Binhai Road

00:07:58.594 --> 00:07:59.594
is unmatched in location.

00:07:59.594 --> 00:08:00.313
You know that?

00:08:01.313 --> 00:08:02.474
Refund us then!

00:08:02.513 --> 00:08:03.714
Stop treating us like fools!

00:08:03.953 --> 00:08:05.474
Give us Binhai Road!

00:08:05.633 --> 00:08:06.273
Except here,

00:08:06.273 --> 00:08:07.554
that place can't compare!

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.160
- You're violating regulations!
- We demand Binhai Road!

00:08:12.393 --> 00:08:14.114
Ms. Li, why are you laughing?

00:08:15.354 --> 00:08:17.633
I'm terrified,
yet you find this amusing?

00:08:18.193 --> 00:08:19.234
Meng, don't panic.

00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:22.554
Mr. Cai has walked right
into Mr. Zheng's trap.

00:08:24.354 --> 00:08:25.474
Trap?

00:08:25.994 --> 00:08:27.234
Yuehai is thriving.

00:08:27.794 --> 00:08:29.513
Given this trajectory,

00:08:30.354 --> 00:08:32.673
building here now guarantees profit.

00:08:33.633 --> 00:08:36.714
Just one month's rent
is substantial income.

00:08:39.873 --> 00:08:42.753
Mr. Cai, thank you
for your answer. Well said.

00:08:43.594 --> 00:08:44.714
You all heard it.

00:08:45.354 --> 00:08:47.913
Mr. Cai acknowledged Yuehai's progress.

00:08:48.834 --> 00:08:51.314
Building is profitable. Rents are high.

00:08:52.033 --> 00:08:52.594
Then,

00:08:53.434 --> 00:08:56.234
why is Yuehai prospering?

00:08:57.553 --> 00:08:59.074
Because of self-employed individuals,

00:08:59.954 --> 00:09:00.454
right?

00:09:02.354 --> 00:09:03.594
Mr. Zheng said

00:09:04.273 --> 00:09:06.393
that Yuehai was built

00:09:06.594 --> 00:09:09.234
by these self-employed individuals
with sacks of cash.

00:09:09.913 --> 00:09:12.793
They laid Yuehai's foundation.

00:09:13.474 --> 00:09:15.553
Now they want Binhai Road

00:09:15.594 --> 00:09:17.393
to create a printing street,

00:09:17.753 --> 00:09:20.474
(Pineapple Bun)
and build Yuehai's pillar industry.

00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:23.793
They're reinforcing Yuehai's framework,

00:09:24.474 --> 00:09:25.834
Yuehai's mainstay,

00:09:26.673 --> 00:09:28.194
and Yuehai's highest standard.

00:09:29.273 --> 00:09:31.434
And Binhai Road

00:09:31.633 --> 00:09:34.594
is Yuehai's optimal location
for pillar industries.

00:09:35.194 --> 00:09:36.194
Mr. Cai said

00:09:36.834 --> 00:09:39.913
that you want
to develop pillar industries,

00:09:40.474 --> 00:09:41.513
but you can't

00:09:42.194 --> 00:09:45.354
just palm off some random

00:09:45.913 --> 00:09:47.954
Xingfu Road on us!

00:09:48.753 --> 00:09:50.153
Mr. Zheng replied...

00:09:50.793 --> 00:09:53.114
Thank you for your question, Mr. Cai.

00:09:57.393 --> 00:09:58.834
As County Land Bureau Director,

00:09:59.234 --> 00:10:00.753
you've surely read more than I have.

00:10:01.513 --> 00:10:03.393
You've read Das Kapital, right?

00:10:05.314 --> 00:10:06.474
I have. What of it?

00:10:07.513 --> 00:10:09.673
I skimmed it but couldn't grasp it.

00:10:10.194 --> 00:10:13.880
But our Town Mayor, Li Qiuping,
a university graduate, understands it.

00:10:14.644 --> 00:10:17.074
There's a passage
I'd like to read to everyone.

00:10:21.074 --> 00:10:22.314
Das Kapital states that

00:10:22.904 --> 00:10:24.792
- Wherever ground-rent exists,
- Wherever ground-rent exists,

00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:26.200
- differential rent exists also.
- differential rent exists also.

00:10:26.673 --> 00:10:29.753
Location is decisive
for differential rent.

00:10:30.393 --> 00:10:33.553
Meanwhile, an increase in population
and in the mobility of customers,

00:10:33.994 --> 00:10:35.480
and the growing demand for housing,

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:38.040
- necessarily raise
- necessarily raise

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.608
- the ground-rent of building sites.
- the ground-rent of building sites.

00:10:41.033 --> 00:10:41.834
Simply put,

00:10:42.834 --> 00:10:43.553
Binhai Road

00:10:44.273 --> 00:10:47.194
is indeed the street
with the best location in Yuehai.

00:10:48.354 --> 00:10:50.273
But without the printing street,
Binhai Road,

00:10:50.994 --> 00:10:51.994
at the land rent level,

00:10:52.594 --> 00:10:54.714
isn't much different
from other streets in Yuehai.

00:10:55.114 --> 00:10:57.434
However, if we establish
the printing street,

00:10:57.873 --> 00:11:00.954
the population
of businesses on this street itself,

00:11:01.873 --> 00:11:05.434
the number of workers,
and customer liquidity,

00:11:05.834 --> 00:11:06.873
will all bring significant

00:11:07.194 --> 00:11:08.673
positive factors to Binhai Road,

00:11:09.434 --> 00:11:11.194
and to the surrounding streets.

00:11:11.673 --> 00:11:13.994
Therefore, rent will keep rising.

00:11:15.434 --> 00:11:16.393
In other words,

00:11:17.234 --> 00:11:19.234
if we build the printing street,

00:11:20.393 --> 00:11:22.553
all rents in Yuehai will rise,

00:11:23.153 --> 00:11:25.954
especially Xingfu Road,
the closest to Binhai Road.

00:11:26.354 --> 00:11:30.393
A place that rented for 100
could now fetch 200, 300,

00:11:31.033 --> 00:11:31.873
or even more.

00:11:32.434 --> 00:11:36.114
Just like the future Yuehai
will become a city of 100,000, 200,000,

00:11:36.513 --> 00:11:38.474
or even 1,000,000 people.

00:11:39.714 --> 00:11:40.954
That makes some sense.

00:11:40.954 --> 00:11:41.994
Who are you fooling?

00:11:41.994 --> 00:11:42.913
It's worth a try.

00:11:44.994 --> 00:11:45.513
Excuse me.

00:11:45.714 --> 00:11:46.214
Who knows?

00:11:46.633 --> 00:11:47.393
Let's just try it.

00:11:48.913 --> 00:11:49.673
Dear cadres,

00:11:50.234 --> 00:11:52.753
this future isn't distant
from us at all.

00:11:53.273 --> 00:11:54.913
As I said just now,

00:11:55.194 --> 00:11:58.673
within three months,
I will deliver Xingfu Road to you all.

00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:02.393
Did everyone hear
what the Mr. Zheng said?

00:12:02.633 --> 00:12:03.994
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:12:04.314 --> 00:12:04.913
Let's do it!

00:12:05.194 --> 00:12:06.633
(Safety First)
Let's do it!

00:12:21.314 --> 00:12:22.753
It's time to resign.

00:12:25.354 --> 00:12:26.594
Mr. Cai, any more questions?

00:12:30.673 --> 00:12:31.474
Then, the next.

00:12:34.513 --> 00:12:35.033
Me.

00:12:44.673 --> 00:12:46.873
Mr. Zheng, you're quite the orator.

00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:49.354
Today, I got to witness

00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:52.633
the most eloquent Secretary
in Pingchuan County.

00:12:53.913 --> 00:12:55.753
No wonder you said back then

00:12:56.393 --> 00:12:58.633
that the Yuehai city construction
was meant for you.

00:12:59.834 --> 00:13:01.273
No wonder those 'monkeys'

00:13:01.594 --> 00:13:05.153
were so willing to follow you to Yuehai.

00:13:06.474 --> 00:13:06.974
Good job.

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:08.474
Truly.

00:13:09.594 --> 00:13:10.633
I admire you greatly.

00:13:17.553 --> 00:13:18.873
There was a moment just now

00:13:19.553 --> 00:13:20.834
when I suddenly became dazed.

00:13:21.474 --> 00:13:25.553
I felt that we were the ones
in the wrong.

00:13:25.753 --> 00:13:29.234
We let down the people,
the government, and the Party.

00:13:29.873 --> 00:13:31.074
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:13:36.234 --> 00:13:40.273
You are eloquent and silver-tongued.

00:13:40.673 --> 00:13:42.994
You're dressing up a betrayal

00:13:43.793 --> 00:13:45.513
as something done for everyone's good.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:48.553
Okay.

00:13:50.314 --> 00:13:52.074
If what you say is true, Mr. Zheng,

00:13:52.834 --> 00:13:54.714
why couldn't you communicate

00:13:54.954 --> 00:13:56.393
with us in advance openly?

00:13:57.314 --> 00:14:00.074
Instead, you tore
the agreement at midnight.

00:14:00.474 --> 00:14:02.913
You'd rather eat
the agreement you signed

00:14:03.873 --> 00:14:06.033
to give Binhai Road
to those self-employed individuals.

00:14:06.872 --> 00:14:07.992
If that's the case,

00:14:07.992 --> 00:14:12.248
then why should the leaders
present here today punish you?

00:14:13.234 --> 00:14:15.314
Wouldn't that be wrongly accusing
a good man?

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:17.234
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

00:14:18.714 --> 00:14:19.393
Well said!

00:14:22.834 --> 00:14:23.873
Don't play the saint!

00:14:25.393 --> 00:14:26.273
Then what are we?

00:14:26.273 --> 00:14:27.873
You can tell us in advance.

00:14:27.873 --> 00:14:28.954
Do you take us for fools?

00:14:28.954 --> 00:14:30.314
How did we become the bad guys,

00:14:30.314 --> 00:14:31.434
while you are the good one?

00:14:31.873 --> 00:14:33.153
We're the ones wronging you?

00:14:33.153 --> 00:14:34.513
We become the villains?

00:14:37.354 --> 00:14:38.074
Mr. Zheng,

00:14:39.434 --> 00:14:41.354
I don't know if I made myself clear.

00:14:41.954 --> 00:14:42.873
If you understood,

00:14:43.994 --> 00:14:45.753
is it that you don't want to answer,

00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:48.994
or you don't dare?

00:15:06.553 --> 00:15:07.153
Ms. Liu,

00:15:08.714 --> 00:15:10.633
you made yourself clear.

00:15:12.234 --> 00:15:13.234
But I have no answer

00:15:14.314 --> 00:15:15.114
to your question.

00:15:20.553 --> 00:15:21.273
No answer.

00:15:24.873 --> 00:15:25.513
And then?

00:15:27.354 --> 00:15:27.873
No answer.

00:15:28.234 --> 00:15:29.434
Wait, you...

00:15:29.513 --> 00:15:32.033
It isn't finished over there! And what?

00:15:33.714 --> 00:15:36.954
Why is there no sound?
What did Mr. Zheng say next?

00:15:37.273 --> 00:15:38.273
Tan, speak.

00:15:43.153 --> 00:15:44.033
Sorry, everyone.

00:15:45.714 --> 00:15:47.633
I truly have no answer
to Ms. Liu's question.

00:15:48.594 --> 00:15:49.434
To be honest,

00:15:50.434 --> 00:15:52.234
last night while writing
the apology draft,

00:15:53.114 --> 00:15:54.594
I also asked myself these questions.

00:15:55.673 --> 00:15:56.673
Why was I impulsive?

00:15:57.633 --> 00:15:58.793
Why couldn't I stay calm

00:15:59.434 --> 00:16:01.834
and find a better solution
for this matter?

00:16:02.393 --> 00:16:03.633
Why did I have to show off?

00:16:06.714 --> 00:16:09.753
The whole Binhai Road incident
happened too fast,

00:16:10.594 --> 00:16:11.474
too suddenly.

00:16:13.474 --> 00:16:15.074
I relied too much on past experience.

00:16:16.234 --> 00:16:17.553
Two groups fought over one road.

00:16:18.354 --> 00:16:22.594
I worried it would pit the cadres
against the people.

00:16:23.553 --> 00:16:25.074
And I was also wrong to play a hero.

00:16:25.553 --> 00:16:26.194
I thought

00:16:26.594 --> 00:16:28.633
I only wanted
what was best for the people.

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:30.328
I didn't mind offending people.

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:32.553
I didn't fear disciplinary action.

00:16:33.273 --> 00:16:33.793
But,

00:16:35.834 --> 00:16:39.594
cadres and the people shouldn't
be pitted against each other.

00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:42.114
We're all human,

00:16:42.513 --> 00:16:43.994
all ordinary people.

00:16:45.793 --> 00:16:48.314
The common folk want
to earn more money and live better lives.

00:16:48.913 --> 00:16:50.114
Don't cadres want that too?

00:16:50.753 --> 00:16:52.474
Who doesn't families?

00:16:53.464 --> 00:16:54.616
Who doesn't need money?

00:16:55.393 --> 00:16:56.553
Who doesn't want a good life?

00:16:57.033 --> 00:16:59.153
Why should cadres
always have to take the loss

00:16:59.513 --> 00:17:00.474
and endure unfairness?

00:17:00.913 --> 00:17:03.114
Cadres already earn less
than the 'monkeys.'

00:17:03.793 --> 00:17:06.353
Why must they give Binhai Road
to the self-employed individuals?

00:17:06.634 --> 00:17:07.394
Why should they?

00:17:08.914 --> 00:17:11.994
I've been working for 19 years.

00:17:12.674 --> 00:17:16.793
Over these 19 years,
I've made too many mistakes.

00:17:17.434 --> 00:17:20.394
Many people have even
been implicated because of me.

00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:25.994
The former Pingchuan secretary
was harmed by me back then.

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:30.033
In 1973, there was a great flood.

00:17:31.474 --> 00:17:32.793
Everyone was fighting the flood.

00:17:33.513 --> 00:17:36.234
But the dam had breached,
and we could only divert the water.

00:17:37.194 --> 00:17:39.313
Either Beizhen
or Tangkou had to be flooded.

00:17:40.353 --> 00:17:41.634
I was the secretary of Beizhen.

00:17:42.073 --> 00:17:43.634
To save Beizhen's orchard,

00:17:44.353 --> 00:17:47.234
I rushed to the former secretary's house
in the middle of a typhoon.

00:17:47.593 --> 00:17:50.634
I pounded the table,
telling him we must save Beizhen.

00:17:51.753 --> 00:17:54.994
The people's orchard is paramount.
It can't be destroyed!

00:17:55.994 --> 00:17:58.073
I kept talking

00:17:58.634 --> 00:17:59.833
for over three hours.

00:18:00.434 --> 00:18:02.474
The former secretary didn't say a word.

00:18:03.353 --> 00:18:04.593
Finally, he nodded and agreed.

00:18:07.674 --> 00:18:08.833
That orchard was saved.

00:18:09.954 --> 00:18:10.833
After the typhoon,

00:18:11.793 --> 00:18:14.033
I wanted to thank him in person,

00:18:14.474 --> 00:18:15.674
treating him to a meal.

00:18:16.313 --> 00:18:18.073
I searched everywhere,

00:18:18.634 --> 00:18:19.593
but couldn't find him.

00:18:20.753 --> 00:18:21.674
Later, it was Guan,

00:18:22.474 --> 00:18:24.434
Mr. Guan, who told me

00:18:24.833 --> 00:18:25.914
that he had taken leave,

00:18:26.994 --> 00:18:28.553
back to Tangkou to relocate graves.

00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:31.273
That flood

00:18:32.634 --> 00:18:36.154
submerged the ancestral graves
of his family.

00:18:37.874 --> 00:18:39.674
But to this day,

00:18:40.474 --> 00:18:42.513
he has never said
anything about this to me.

00:18:44.234 --> 00:18:46.434
And I also harmed Zhu
from the credit union.

00:18:46.994 --> 00:18:48.793
Back when I was
raising turtles in Jinshan,

00:18:49.113 --> 00:18:50.273
I borrowed 10,000 from him.

00:18:50.874 --> 00:18:52.674
But I was scammed
during the breeding process.

00:18:56.073 --> 00:18:58.113
And Mr. Liu,
the former Agriculture Bureau Director.

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:00.593
Isn't that Ms. Liu's father?

00:19:02.714 --> 00:19:05.593
After that 10,000 yuan was scammed,

00:19:06.793 --> 00:19:08.553
no one in Jinshan
believed in me anymore.

00:19:09.994 --> 00:19:11.474
No villager dared to follow me.

00:19:12.313 --> 00:19:14.954
No matter how I tried
to mobilize them, no one listened.

00:19:15.474 --> 00:19:16.033
Finally,

00:19:17.353 --> 00:19:19.033
it was Mr. Liu who helped me out.

00:19:20.394 --> 00:19:21.634
After he resigned,

00:19:22.793 --> 00:19:24.273
he leased a pond for turtle farming.

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:28.634
That day, he came to me
wearing rubber overalls and boots.

00:19:29.593 --> 00:19:30.394
I asked him.

00:19:31.553 --> 00:19:33.273
I said, "Mr. Liu,

00:19:35.593 --> 00:19:37.073
you'll be retiring in six months."

00:19:38.194 --> 00:19:39.273
"Isn't it a pity?"

00:19:40.553 --> 00:19:41.753
He smiled and said to me,

00:19:42.994 --> 00:19:43.714
"Yes."

00:19:44.553 --> 00:19:45.954
"I'm retiring in six months."

00:19:46.994 --> 00:19:48.313
"What's the pity?"

00:19:51.874 --> 00:19:54.753
Only later did I learn
that he had rheumatism.

00:19:55.674 --> 00:19:57.073
His knees hurt in water.

00:19:58.474 --> 00:20:00.073
But he never complained.

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.753
He just kept working in the water,

00:20:04.553 --> 00:20:06.593
raising turtles for five full years.

00:20:08.434 --> 00:20:10.313
Mr. Liu was truly great.

00:20:10.874 --> 00:20:12.513
I wondered why Mr. Liu retired early.

00:20:13.073 --> 00:20:14.394
Turns out it was for this.

00:20:15.073 --> 00:20:16.073
Such noble character.

00:20:16.593 --> 00:20:17.994
Think how many this could benefit.

00:20:18.234 --> 00:20:19.634
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:20:19.833 --> 00:20:20.753
Truly remarkable.

00:20:20.753 --> 00:20:23.234
I heard Mr. Liu used his own money
to fund the turtle farming.

00:20:24.553 --> 00:20:25.154
Remarkable.

00:20:25.234 --> 00:20:26.113
Truly a good cadre.

00:20:26.954 --> 00:20:27.474
Truly.

00:20:30.954 --> 00:20:32.033
If we were like Mr. Liu,

00:20:32.273 --> 00:20:32.874
then we...

00:20:51.273 --> 00:20:51.994
Xie.

00:20:55.234 --> 00:20:58.313
You... I'm straining
my eyes reading this.

00:20:58.634 --> 00:20:59.273
You do it.

00:21:00.954 --> 00:21:01.793
Turn it on yourself.

00:21:10.073 --> 00:21:10.714
Continue.

00:21:12.474 --> 00:21:17.793
Everyone, this list of people
implicated because of me is very long.

00:21:19.394 --> 00:21:21.353
Some of them have already passed away.

00:21:22.394 --> 00:21:23.674
Each of them,

00:21:24.714 --> 00:21:26.073
through their words and actions,

00:21:27.113 --> 00:21:30.234
showed me what a true cadre really is.

00:21:31.874 --> 00:21:34.994
When benefits are available,
the common people get them first.

00:21:35.154 --> 00:21:37.833
When difficulties arise,
the cadres step forward first.

00:21:38.273 --> 00:21:39.474
Put the people's interests

00:21:40.434 --> 00:21:41.513
first and foremost.

00:21:42.474 --> 00:21:43.954
Do things for the common folk

00:21:44.674 --> 00:21:45.553
without delay.

00:21:46.874 --> 00:21:49.353
My arrogance, impulsiveness,

00:21:49.833 --> 00:21:50.994
and obstinacy

00:21:51.954 --> 00:21:55.434
exacerbated the conflict between cadres
and self-employed individuals,

00:21:56.394 --> 00:21:58.234
leading to the situation we face now.

00:22:00.154 --> 00:22:01.073
I'm truly sorry.

00:22:04.954 --> 00:22:06.353
I've said all I need to say.

00:22:07.513 --> 00:22:10.154
Whether you can forgive me or not,

00:22:11.154 --> 00:22:14.273
I hope this Binhai Road issue ends here.

00:22:15.553 --> 00:22:16.793
It stops with me.

00:22:26.914 --> 00:22:27.513
I'm sorry.

00:23:08.474 --> 00:23:09.634
He's pretty sharp.

00:23:11.033 --> 00:23:11.753
Pretty sharp.

00:23:18.194 --> 00:23:22.234

00:23:55.313 --> 00:23:55.833
Everyone,

00:23:57.154 --> 00:23:59.914
Zheng Decheng's statement has concluded.

00:24:00.914 --> 00:24:01.593
I believe

00:24:02.113 --> 00:24:04.674
everyone present is deeply moved.

00:24:06.234 --> 00:24:07.353
I was profoundly affected.

00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:10.994
Regarding his personal issues
and the mistakes he made,

00:24:12.194 --> 00:24:15.394
the county will,
based on the circumstances,

00:24:16.353 --> 00:24:19.474
further investigate, handle,
and publicly announce the findings.

00:24:20.474 --> 00:24:22.793
But here, I must criticize some cadres.

00:24:23.593 --> 00:24:26.434
They cut off the power arbitrarily
for personal gain!

00:24:27.553 --> 00:24:28.472
What conduct is that?

00:24:30.674 --> 00:24:32.593
Cadres who lead in such a manner

00:24:33.914 --> 00:24:36.234
will be criticized
and given a disciplinary warning.

00:24:37.273 --> 00:24:40.313
On behalf of the county committee,
I will also issue an initiative.

00:24:40.914 --> 00:24:41.914
Only one thing to learn.

00:24:43.753 --> 00:24:45.154
All our cadres,

00:24:45.914 --> 00:24:47.234
no matter when,

00:24:47.714 --> 00:24:51.234
must always put
the people's interests first.

Mr. Zheng is something else,
truly impressive.

00:25:21.874 --> 00:25:23.833
Alright, you've been
saying that the whole way.

00:25:24.674 --> 00:25:25.174
Qiuping,

00:25:26.273 --> 00:25:28.073
I need to head back now.

00:25:28.474 --> 00:25:30.033
I have to finish the draft quickly.

00:25:31.753 --> 00:25:33.113
So you came all this way

00:25:33.954 --> 00:25:35.154
just for Mr. Zheng?

The last box from the west gate shop.

00:25:40.394 --> 00:25:42.154
The owner was going
to keep it for himself.

00:25:43.914 --> 00:25:45.874
Qiuping, please accept it.

00:25:54.392 --> 00:25:55.320
Well then, I'll...

00:25:56.073 --> 00:25:56.573
Go on.

00:25:58.434 --> 00:25:58.934

Softly.

00:26:50.874 --> 00:26:51.434
He's tired.

00:26:54.474 --> 00:26:55.593
He carried the burden alone.

00:26:57.434 --> 00:26:57.954
Yeah.

00:26:59.674 --> 00:27:00.194
Smells good.

00:27:04.674 --> 00:27:06.273
Mr. Zheng's still asleep.

00:27:06.753 --> 00:27:07.353
Food's ready.

00:27:07.353 --> 00:27:08.634
Keep your voices down.

00:27:09.753 --> 00:27:10.353
Still asleep?

00:27:10.353 --> 00:27:11.073
Quietly.

00:27:11.674 --> 00:27:12.553
So much food today!

00:27:13.434 --> 00:27:14.674
Who cooked all this?

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:15.674
Ms. Li made it.

00:27:15.674 --> 00:27:16.474
Ms. Li?

00:27:16.474 --> 00:27:17.400
Luckily, we had her.

00:27:18.194 --> 00:27:19.853
I really need to step up my game, right?

00:27:20.154 --> 00:27:20.833
Pretty good.

00:27:26.474 --> 00:27:27.513
Mr. Zheng's still asleep.

00:27:27.793 --> 00:27:29.394
Let's eat once he wakes up, okay?

00:27:29.394 --> 00:27:30.634
Go wash your hands first, okay?

00:27:30.634 --> 00:27:31.608
- Move that way a bit.
- Go on.

00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:32.174
Go.

00:27:33.714 --> 00:27:34.434
Here, for you.

00:27:37.513 --> 00:27:38.073
Over here.

00:27:40.113 --> 00:27:40.613
Ms. Li.

00:27:41.394 --> 00:27:42.194
Still sleeping?

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:44.113
Let him sleep a bit longer.

00:27:48.914 --> 00:27:49.753
This is Mr. Zheng's.

00:27:49.753 --> 00:27:50.954
Come on. Let's take our seats.

00:27:51.073 --> 00:27:53.533
Mr. Lin, you just got back
from the site. Must be exhausted.

00:27:53.593 --> 00:27:54.513
Go ahead and eat.

00:27:54.793 --> 00:27:55.553
No.

00:27:55.954 --> 00:27:57.874
We'll wait for Mr. Zheng
and eat together.

00:27:58.013 --> 00:27:58.513
Yes.

00:27:58.513 --> 00:27:59.273
Wait for Mr. Zheng.

00:27:59.273 --> 00:28:00.394
Okay. We'll wait together.

00:28:00.474 --> 00:28:00.994
Come on.

00:28:01.073 --> 00:28:02.073
Come on, Xie.

00:28:04.234 --> 00:28:04.753
Have a seat.

00:28:06.273 --> 00:28:06.874
He's worn out.

00:28:06.994 --> 00:28:08.504
Ms. Li, I heard you made all this.

00:28:09.336 --> 00:28:09.994
Impressive!

00:28:10.113 --> 00:28:11.194
Not all of it.

00:28:11.714 --> 00:28:12.214
Okay.

00:29:13.154 --> 00:29:13.914
What time is it?

00:29:14.073 --> 00:29:15.154
- Mr. Zheng, you're awake.
- Mr. Zheng, you're awake.

00:29:15.154 --> 00:29:16.434
- He's awake!
- He's awake!

00:29:16.474 --> 00:29:18.073
- He's awake!
- Mr. Zheng.

00:29:18.234 --> 00:29:19.194
He's awake!

00:29:19.313 --> 00:29:19.874
Come on. Sit.

00:29:20.033 --> 00:29:20.753
That's great!

00:29:20.914 --> 00:29:21.753
So much food!

00:29:23.073 --> 00:29:24.154
It's okay.

00:29:24.753 --> 00:29:25.513
You're exhausted.

00:29:26.714 --> 00:29:29.474
Meng, what meds did you give me?

00:29:29.714 --> 00:29:31.434
Why do I feel dizzier the more I sleep?

00:29:31.634 --> 00:29:34.154
I told you about every medication
before you took it.

00:29:34.634 --> 00:29:37.154
One of them
was for insomnia and sedation.

00:29:37.833 --> 00:29:40.513
You needed to calm down
the most at the time.

00:29:40.593 --> 00:29:41.113
I see.

00:29:41.674 --> 00:29:42.434
So you're saying,

00:29:42.474 --> 00:29:44.273
if I hadn't taken it,

00:29:44.513 --> 00:29:46.394
I would've passed out
right at the start, huh?

00:29:47.674 --> 00:29:49.714
Maybe the dosage was too high.

00:29:50.474 --> 00:29:51.800
Come on. Pour the wine.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:52.833
Come on. Pour the wine.

00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:53.914
Pour it yourselves.

00:29:54.073 --> 00:29:54.954
Here, pour some tea.

00:29:55.154 --> 00:29:56.874
No need to be polite. We're family.

00:29:56.914 --> 00:29:58.154
It's like the Spring Festival.

00:29:59.874 --> 00:30:00.674
I'll have some too.

00:30:00.674 --> 00:30:01.833
Just a small amount for me.

00:30:01.874 --> 00:30:02.593
Okay.

00:30:02.593 --> 00:30:03.994
Just a little.

00:30:03.994 --> 00:30:04.954
I can't drink much.

00:30:05.313 --> 00:30:06.194
Pour some for Lin.

00:30:06.634 --> 00:30:07.273
Pour the wine.

00:30:07.273 --> 00:30:08.553
Everyone's here now.

00:30:09.073 --> 00:30:10.553
Let me propose a toast.

00:30:11.194 --> 00:30:11.914
Okay.

00:30:13.513 --> 00:30:14.994
Wake up and drink again.

00:30:20.154 --> 00:30:21.194
The Binhai Road situation

00:30:22.634 --> 00:30:23.474
is finally behind us.

00:30:25.273 --> 00:30:28.073
After surviving a disaster,
good fortune follows.

00:30:29.474 --> 00:30:31.474
Inform Ms. Chang and Xuemei.

00:30:31.914 --> 00:30:32.674
Starting tomorrow,

00:30:33.954 --> 00:30:36.194
the printing street project
can get underway.

00:30:36.593 --> 00:30:37.093
Do it.

00:30:37.134 --> 00:30:37.634
Do it.

00:30:37.634 --> 00:30:39.194
Let's drink the night away.

00:30:39.513 --> 00:30:42.033
Tomorrow, we fight again
at the construction site!

00:30:42.353 --> 00:30:42.853
Okay!

00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:44.113
- Cheers! Come on!
- Cheers!

00:30:44.313 --> 00:30:44.874
Cheers!

00:30:45.113 --> 00:30:46.273
Cheers!

00:30:46.394 --> 00:30:46.914
Down it!

00:30:55.793 --> 00:30:56.474
Come on.

00:30:57.353 --> 00:30:58.634
Come on! Dig in!

00:30:59.353 --> 00:31:00.513
I'm starving!

00:31:00.753 --> 00:31:01.253
Mr. Zheng.

00:31:02.793 --> 00:31:03.434
Ms. Li.

00:31:05.194 --> 00:31:06.954
Okay, let me say a few words.

00:31:07.593 --> 00:31:10.313
Since everyone's here,
I'll admit a mistake first.

00:31:11.434 --> 00:31:14.394
During the vote, I voted against.

00:31:15.793 --> 00:31:17.833
So, just this one.

00:31:19.634 --> 00:31:21.874
Don't start, Xie.
You have work tomorrow.

00:31:22.234 --> 00:31:23.234
I knew you'd stop me.

00:31:25.474 --> 00:31:27.234
I-I also want to say something.

00:31:27.234 --> 00:31:28.073
Well, Mr. Zheng...

00:31:28.073 --> 00:31:28.632
You say.

00:31:28.874 --> 00:31:29.954
I think it was necessary.

00:31:29.954 --> 00:31:30.994
Because, sorry.

00:31:30.994 --> 00:31:31.954
Okay, hold this.

00:31:32.553 --> 00:31:33.714
I think you each should drink

00:31:33.753 --> 00:31:34.833
at least three bottles.

00:31:35.874 --> 00:31:36.513
I can't.

00:31:36.753 --> 00:31:37.593
Xie, Tan.

00:31:38.033 --> 00:31:39.154
I know what you want to say.

00:31:39.833 --> 00:31:41.513
Let me speak first today.

00:31:41.914 --> 00:31:42.414
Okay.

00:31:42.954 --> 00:31:43.753
Let Tofu speak.

00:31:43.753 --> 00:31:44.313
Yes.

00:31:44.313 --> 00:31:45.154
Lin wants to speak.

00:31:45.154 --> 00:31:45.816
He never talks.

00:31:45.816 --> 00:31:46.833
Come on. Tofu, speak.

00:31:46.833 --> 00:31:47.394
Less for me.

00:31:47.394 --> 00:31:47.954
Come on.

00:31:53.313 --> 00:31:53.874
Mr. Zheng.

00:32:05.994 --> 00:32:06.494
Lin!

00:32:07.384 --> 00:32:09.113
W-What's going on?

00:32:09.154 --> 00:32:10.033
What's going on?

00:32:14.394 --> 00:32:14.954
Master.

00:32:15.513 --> 00:32:16.934
Master, hold on! Master!

00:32:21.434 --> 00:32:23.474
Ms. Li, check Lin's pockets.

00:32:24.194 --> 00:32:24.694
Okay.

00:32:25.994 --> 00:32:26.513
What is this?

00:32:26.833 --> 00:32:28.994
Unwrap that candy and feed it to Lin.

00:32:29.176 --> 00:32:30.200
He has low blood sugar.

00:32:30.714 --> 00:32:32.313
How can he eat it when he's unconscious?

00:32:32.553 --> 00:32:34.714
You feed him. I'm scared.

00:32:57.353 --> 00:32:59.714
Master, hold on! Master!

00:33:00.553 --> 00:33:01.113
Slow down.

00:33:02.874 --> 00:33:03.593
(Emergency Room)
Doctor.

00:33:03.593 --> 00:33:04.434
Make way, please.

00:33:22.753 --> 00:33:23.394
Where's Tan?

00:33:24.513 --> 00:33:25.833
I had them all go back first.

00:33:28.313 --> 00:33:29.593
Mr. Zheng. Ms. Li.

00:33:30.093 --> 00:33:31.474
Nurse, over here!

00:33:32.434 --> 00:33:34.513
Mr. Zheng, the nurse
needs someone to sign here.

00:33:34.714 --> 00:33:35.474
Who is his family?

00:33:35.833 --> 00:33:36.914
Me. I am.

00:33:37.033 --> 00:33:37.753
Who are you?

00:33:38.234 --> 00:33:40.033
I'm his leader at work.

00:33:40.553 --> 00:33:42.033
Sign now. Don't delay the rescue.

00:33:50.898 --> 00:33:54.680
(Lin Dongfu: Cause of Altered
Consciousness under Investigation)

00:34:06.033 --> 00:34:07.234
Decheng!

00:34:10.954 --> 00:34:13.754
Decheng, your wife is really gone!

00:34:29.994 --> 00:34:31.513
Sign now. Don't delay the rescue.

00:34:32.113 --> 00:34:32.613
Mr. Zheng.

00:34:47.673 --> 00:34:48.173
Okay.

00:34:55.113 --> 00:34:57.233
Have a candy. You look pale.

00:35:35.506 --> 00:35:38.072
(Emergency Room)

00:35:41.434 --> 00:35:43.233
The patient is stable
and back in the ward.

00:35:44.193 --> 00:35:45.874
Thank you.

00:36:24.314 --> 00:36:25.713
He's still the deputy mayor, right?

00:36:27.233 --> 00:36:29.193
The report made it seem like
he couldn't even eat.

00:36:29.633 --> 00:36:30.193
Look.

00:36:31.394 --> 00:36:33.914
His blood creatinine, albumin level,

00:36:34.153 --> 00:36:36.193
and urea nitrogen are all abnormal.

00:36:36.233 --> 00:36:37.434
This is severe malnutrition.

00:36:37.754 --> 00:36:38.713
He needs to recuperate.

00:36:39.073 --> 00:36:40.233
Just an IV drip today.

00:36:41.113 --> 00:36:42.874
When you go back, tell him to rest.

00:36:43.128 --> 00:36:44.633
Balanced diet. Small frequent meals.

00:36:45.874 --> 00:36:46.374
Okay.

00:36:47.553 --> 00:36:49.474
Can you be more specific?

00:36:52.914 --> 00:36:54.834
Just to meet the basic needs of society.

00:36:54.834 --> 00:36:57.233
- The debate rehearsal has started?
- Yes.

00:36:57.673 --> 00:36:59.113
Should I go in and ask them to stop?

00:36:59.113 --> 00:37:00.033
The watchdog theory...

00:37:00.033 --> 00:37:01.754
No, we'll just listen.

00:37:01.914 --> 00:37:02.593
What problem?

00:37:02.754 --> 00:37:04.633
Of course, there's a problem.

00:37:05.073 --> 00:37:05.994
In today's China,

00:37:06.394 --> 00:37:07.673
on the land beneath our feet,

00:37:07.874 --> 00:37:10.954
how many unprecedented new things
are happening every moment?

00:37:11.553 --> 00:37:13.880
From Xiaogang's first stir
to the awakening of the Huangpu,

00:37:13.954 --> 00:37:16.633
which one isn't impacting
and refreshing our understanding?

00:37:16.874 --> 00:37:19.474
What we should do now
is to immerse into the masses

00:37:19.673 --> 00:37:21.834
to understand and investigate
every new thing,

00:37:21.994 --> 00:37:24.954
instead of being complacent
like our opponents,

00:37:25.153 --> 00:37:27.153
attempting to use
their existing knowledge system

00:37:27.233 --> 00:37:28.593
to judge these new things.

00:37:29.073 --> 00:37:30.314
You're twisting the argument.

00:37:30.633 --> 00:37:31.394
Our side believes

00:37:31.553 --> 00:37:32.914
it is exactly what you said

00:37:33.113 --> 00:37:35.994
that makes professional
journalistic gatekeeping necessary

00:37:36.113 --> 00:37:37.314
in this under-informed region.

00:37:37.394 --> 00:37:38.794
What makes you the gatekeeper?

00:37:39.113 --> 00:37:40.033
Who are you to decide

00:37:40.113 --> 00:37:42.794
what people should see or shouldn't see?

00:37:43.474 --> 00:37:44.274
Just last week,

00:37:44.513 --> 00:37:46.072
in the Yuehai Town of our province,

00:37:46.648 --> 00:37:48.113
their secretary apologized

00:37:48.314 --> 00:37:51.153
to over 1,000 cadres in an auditorium.

00:37:51.673 --> 00:37:52.274
He said,

00:37:52.513 --> 00:37:55.113
"When the interests of cadres
and the common people conflict,

00:37:55.474 --> 00:37:57.434
cadres must prioritize
the people's interests."

00:37:57.754 --> 00:37:58.354
Yes.

00:38:06.386 --> 00:38:09.434
(Exit Before Boarding)

00:38:09.434 --> 00:38:10.033
Come on.

00:38:24.673 --> 00:38:26.553
Hello, I'm Li Qiuping,
the Town Mayor of Yuehai.

00:38:26.894 --> 00:38:28.593
Welcome to Xingfu Road for a tour.

00:38:29.314 --> 00:38:30.553
Construction is underway here.

00:38:30.834 --> 00:38:32.354
So please be mindful of safety.

00:38:32.673 --> 00:38:34.314
Take a hard hat and watch your step.

00:38:34.593 --> 00:38:35.153
Leader,

00:38:35.394 --> 00:38:36.274
put on the hard hat.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:38.474
Thank you very much.

00:38:38.474 --> 00:38:39.713
Liu, this is for you.

00:38:39.713 --> 00:38:40.434
Stay safe.

00:38:40.754 --> 00:38:41.254
Leader.

00:38:41.432 --> 00:38:42.513
Leaders, please.

00:38:42.553 --> 00:38:43.633
Come and get a hard hat.

00:38:43.914 --> 00:38:45.193
Put on your hard hats.

00:38:45.434 --> 00:38:46.474
Watch your step later.

00:38:46.474 --> 00:38:46.974
Come.

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:50.593
Come, this way.

00:38:51.394 --> 00:38:53.592
It's very close
to the commercial street on Fuyu Road.

00:38:53.714 --> 00:38:56.593
The landscaping here will eventually
be just like Binhai Road,

00:38:56.794 --> 00:38:59.193
with two rows of poplar saplings.
And there'll be shrubs too.

00:38:59.954 --> 00:39:00.673
Ms. Li,

00:39:01.553 --> 00:39:04.474
at the meeting, Mr. Zheng promised
a three-month deadline.

00:39:04.954 --> 00:39:06.193
Has your plan changed now?

00:39:06.593 --> 00:39:07.954
Yeah, is there still enough time?

00:39:08.233 --> 00:39:10.954
I heard the deputy mayor in charge
of this road worked himself sick.

00:39:11.193 --> 00:39:12.513
Can it be finished as planned?

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.713
- Exactly.
- That's right.

00:39:13.834 --> 00:39:16.354
Don't rush the schedule just
to end up with subpar work quality.

00:39:17.073 --> 00:39:18.394
- Exactly!
- That's right!

00:39:18.754 --> 00:39:19.474
Ms. Li,

00:39:19.754 --> 00:39:21.354
once this road is finished,

00:39:21.834 --> 00:39:23.593
it'll be about as good
as Binhai Road, right?

00:39:26.153 --> 00:39:27.513
Rest assured.

00:39:27.954 --> 00:39:29.713
Mr. Zheng also promised at the meeting

00:39:29.713 --> 00:39:31.874
that it will be finished
on time with good quality.

00:39:32.193 --> 00:39:32.994
That's fine.

00:39:34.073 --> 00:39:34.573
Right?

00:39:35.233 --> 00:39:35.874
Yes.

00:39:36.113 --> 00:39:39.553
But if it can't be finished on time
with quality by then,

00:39:40.153 --> 00:39:41.314
what do you plan to do?

00:39:41.954 --> 00:39:43.434
Hope it isn't another delay tactic

00:39:43.713 --> 00:39:44.394
to trick us.

00:39:44.394 --> 00:39:45.880
Yeah. Don't try to trick us.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.073
Don't be another trick.

00:39:47.073 --> 00:39:49.914
I know whatever I say,
you all must still have doubts.

00:39:50.233 --> 00:39:52.593
There's still time
before the three-month deadline.

00:39:52.994 --> 00:39:55.914
By then, we'll definitely invite you all
to our completion ceremony.

00:39:56.113 --> 00:39:58.314
Our Yuehai Town Government
keeps its word.

00:39:58.673 --> 00:39:59.173
Okay.

00:39:59.314 --> 00:40:00.073
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:40:00.233 --> 00:40:00.733
Alright.

00:40:02.394 --> 00:40:03.633
Then we'll wait and see.

00:40:05.354 --> 00:40:06.153
Thank you.

00:40:06.593 --> 00:40:07.274
It's alright.

00:40:10.954 --> 00:40:12.914
We've seen it. Let's head back now.

00:40:13.434 --> 00:40:14.513
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:40:15.794 --> 00:40:16.754
Take care.

00:40:33.474 --> 00:40:35.153
You've all worked hard.

00:40:35.954 --> 00:40:37.153
You've worked hard.

00:40:37.314 --> 00:40:38.434
Hurry up a bit.

00:40:38.794 --> 00:40:41.673
Everyone, I know you're working hard,

00:40:42.354 --> 00:40:46.354
but our deadline is tight,
and the workload is heavy.

00:40:46.914 --> 00:40:50.354
Once it's done, all of you
will be heroes of Yuehai...

00:40:52.354 --> 00:40:53.673
Why did this truck stop?

00:40:54.033 --> 00:40:56.233
Earlier, Mr. Lin said this area

00:40:56.233 --> 00:40:59.314
has a problem. It might collapse
and needs checking.

00:40:59.754 --> 00:41:00.673
Then check!

00:41:00.994 --> 00:41:02.834
But Mr. Lin isn't here, I...

00:41:02.834 --> 00:41:04.088
Only he knows it, Mr. Zheng.

00:41:04.088 --> 00:41:04.760
- How to check.
- Lime.

00:41:04.994 --> 00:41:05.494
Mr. Zheng.

00:41:07.113 --> 00:41:08.568
The hospital is running out of lime.

00:41:08.568 --> 00:41:10.754
Don't tell me lime
is also Mr. Lin's responsibility?

00:41:12.153 --> 00:41:13.434
Hasn't it always been Mr. Lin?

00:41:14.153 --> 00:41:15.033
Be careful!

00:41:17.474 --> 00:41:18.113
Yu Qingtian!

00:41:18.434 --> 00:41:19.474
Make sure it gets fixed.

00:41:19.474 --> 00:41:20.952
- Yu Qingtian!
- Can't delay our progress.

00:41:21.274 --> 00:41:21.954
Yu Qingtian.

00:41:21.994 --> 00:41:22.593
Mr. Zheng.

00:41:22.633 --> 00:41:24.073
- Go.
- Come over here.

00:41:24.994 --> 00:41:25.784
What's wrong?

00:41:25.784 --> 00:41:27.096
When will the lime arrive?

00:41:29.794 --> 00:41:31.553
The next batch
will arrive at 8 AM tomorrow.

00:41:32.394 --> 00:41:33.434
Please beg them.

00:41:33.633 --> 00:41:35.434
Ask them to deliver
as quickly as possible.

00:41:35.633 --> 00:41:36.954
- Mr. Zheng.
- Okay.

00:41:37.153 --> 00:41:39.033
The mixer! The mixer's acting up again!

00:41:40.394 --> 00:41:40.994
Go take a look.

00:41:45.754 --> 00:41:46.394
Yu.

00:41:48.394 --> 00:41:50.153
Your master needs rest
during this period.

00:41:51.233 --> 00:41:51.914
I know.

00:41:55.834 --> 00:41:57.434
I know you want to go to Shenzhen,

00:41:58.914 --> 00:42:00.874
and you've been unhappy because of it.

00:42:04.513 --> 00:42:05.233
Yu,

00:42:06.834 --> 00:42:08.794
you need to have faith in Yuehai.

00:42:09.914 --> 00:42:10.834
Aside from your master,

00:42:11.673 --> 00:42:13.394
you know the site best.

00:42:14.193 --> 00:42:15.474
While your master is away,

00:42:16.394 --> 00:42:17.673
you need to step up quickly.

00:42:17.954 --> 00:42:19.633
You need to hold things together.

00:42:23.633 --> 00:42:24.153
Mr. Zheng,

00:42:24.754 --> 00:42:26.593
confidence doesn't mean
being unrealistic.

00:42:27.713 --> 00:42:28.354
Three months.

00:42:29.673 --> 00:42:30.954
My master almost died.

00:42:40.274 --> 00:42:40.914
Mr. Zheng.

00:42:42.113 --> 00:42:43.233
Mr. Zheng, Mr. Yu.

00:42:44.434 --> 00:42:45.713
The roller's broken down again.

00:42:47.113 --> 00:42:47.994
I'll go take a look.

00:42:54.153 --> 00:42:55.384
Holding things together?

00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:56.673
Fine!
