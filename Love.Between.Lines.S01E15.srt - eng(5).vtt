[Episode 15]

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.160
Have you made a decision?

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.480
Aren't you coming in?

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.280
Honey,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.590
I suddenly have a business dinner tonight.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.590
Go to bed early. Don't wait up for me.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.010
How about Friday night?

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.320
I'll take you out for dinner.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.440
Let's not go out.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.190
Just stay at home.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.590
I'll prepare something.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.360
But you have to promise me—

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.760
you must come home early.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.300
[Happy 2nd Wedding Anniversary!]

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.400
Did I wake you?

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.680
No.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.800
Drink this.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.040
It'll help you sober up.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.450
Honey...

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.930
I'm sorry I came home late again.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:28.680
It's okay.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.450
I know you've been busy.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.320
Sorry it's a day late.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.030
Happy second wedding anniversary.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.630
It's beautiful.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.210
I like it.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.910
I thought you'd forgotten.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.560
How could I?

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.750
Miss,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.360
we've been going in circles.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.830
Where exactly are you going?

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.000
This place is way too hard to find.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.390
Even the GPS can't locate it.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.360
We can't just

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.680
keep driving around.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:40.720
Alright,

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.000
I'll just get off here.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.860
Thank you, sir.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.710
Okay.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.800
Hello, excuse me,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.660
do you know where this factory is?

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.250
I really don't know, sorry.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.310
Sorry.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.190
Hello, hello, excuse me.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.520
Do you know where this ceramic factory is?

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.430
It's...

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.410
Your destination is on your left.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.930
Navigation complete.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.830
Hello,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.970
my name is Hu Xiu.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.159
I'm an assistant architect

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:50.360
from D Design Studio.

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:52.070
Here's the thing:

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.270
I recently saw your products

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.440
at a ceramics exhibition
featured in a magazine.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.480
They fit perfectly with one of
our architectural project's requirements.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.120
So I wanted to come and learn more

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.800
and see if we could establish further...

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.830
I'm not the boss.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.290
I'm just a security guard.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.370
Then where's your boss?

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:07.600
Over there.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.050
Is the content okay?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.190
Yeah.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.070
We have designated personnel
handling the legal matters.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.480
As long as the content is fine,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.680
you can rest assured.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.430
It's pretty tidy here.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.070
Feel free to contact me
if there are any issues in the future.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.130
Looking forward to working with you.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.650
This way, Mr. Ma.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.560
Take care.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.750
You must be tired from the meeting.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.070
I brought you some fruit.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.310
-Thank you, Xiaorou.
-Thank you, Xiaorou.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.530
Perfect timing. I need some sugar.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.720
I'm exhausted.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.950
Guangming has been running around
these past few days

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:50.950
barely even having time for lunch,

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:51.950
just to meet clients.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.390
What do you have to complain about?

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.190
Well, it's a sweet complaint.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:56.750
But honestly,

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.600
anywhere is better than Longyuan.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.000
Let me tell you,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.600
I just don't have Guangming's courage.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.560
Before he left,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.160
he really let Qu have it.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.470
That was so awesome, right, Guangming?

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:06.960
Let's go have fruit.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.060
What does he mean by "let Qu have it"?

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.560
You left Longyuan?

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.920
G-Go have fruit.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.600
Okay.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.480
Honey,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.200
come with me for a moment.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.990
What's going on?

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.630
Have a seat, honey.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.800
Mr. Qu found out about Zhan Jie and me

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.890
starting our own business.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.240
I'm in the middle of handing things over

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.100
and will officially resign soon.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.830
But honey, don't worry.

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:43.750
Tao registered Solara,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.120
and I've checked
Longyuan's internal policies.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.980
Mr. Qu can't hold us accountable.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.800
Guangming,

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.040
I've always felt

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.950
that you were working too hard before.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.630
I've always supported

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.120
you leaving Longyuan.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.830
But why is your first reaction always

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.690
to hide things from me
whenever something happens?

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.070
Is there anything

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:05.950
that we, as husband and wife, can't...

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.150
can't face together?

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.510
It's just that I thought

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.000
the procedures weren't complete

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.430
and the company wasn't stable yet,

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.830
so I didn't dare tell you.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.680
Honey, I know this would make you worry.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.390
I was wrong.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.630
I'm sorry.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.950
I promise you

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.680
from now on, I'll tell you about
any decision I make.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.870
No more hiding things,

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:27.560
okay?

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.920
Don't be mad anymore, okay?

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.570
I have good news for you.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.320
Remember I mentioned

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:46.720
that a major company

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.120
was interested in taking over our project?

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:50.840
Five minutes ago,

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.410
we just signed

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:53.730
the contract.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.630
Our company will definitely make it.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.320
The big house we want,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.270
a big coffee shop,

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.870
and a big dog—

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.790
we'll have them all.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.640
Even if you don't have to
run between two companies,

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.900
you'll still be busy like a spinning top.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.740
Busy like what?

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.510
A spinning top.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.870
A spinning top.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:22.570
A big spinning top.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.090
I'm just a medium spinning top.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.510
-They're spinning!
-Yeah!

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.030
I won't be a spinning top.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.200
Don't be mad anymore.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.480
What are these two doing?

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.630
They're so sweet!

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.440
So sweet!

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:40.730
They're watching.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.240
Hu Xiu?

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.630
Miss,

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:22.800
do you work here?

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.560
This place is quite remote.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.120
After my last drop-off,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.030
I thought I'd have to drive back
with no customer,

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.230
but I didn't expect to run into you here.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.960
What a coincidence, sir.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.870
If I hadn't run into you driving out here,

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:36.360
I wouldn't have been able to get back.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.420
I've been trying to get a cab for ages.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:45.550
Hello, Sun.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.360
Hu Xiu,

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.240
Lyman's celebration banquet
is about to start.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.200
When will you arrive?

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.480
I'm already on my way.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.800
Should be there soon.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.550
Sir,

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.000
could you please drive a bit faster?
Thanks.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.150
Sure, no problem.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.450
I'll be there soon.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.270
Mr. Xiao.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.120
Congratulations on
winning the competition.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.510
You're truly a young talent

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.440
with unlimited potential.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.030
Mr. Xiao.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.390
You flatter me.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.320
Our company has a project,

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.670
and we'd like to invite you
to be our consultant.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.130
You must accept our offer.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:36.870
Mr. Xiao,

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.270
so successful at a young age.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:38.930
I wonder...

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.360
are you married?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.600
No.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.400
Starting a family and building a career

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.920
go hand in hand,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:45.750
am I right?

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:56.350
Thank you.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.450
Mr. Song, come on.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.990
Could you introduce us?

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:05.830
No problem.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:06.470
Xiao!

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.030
Mr. Xie, Mr. Li.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.600
Mr. Xiao,

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.980
this is my daughter, An'an.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.290
Nice to meet you.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.680
Let's go.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.150
Ms. Hu?

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.650
This feels like déjà vu.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.300
What?

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.980
Here to play
the beauty rescuing the hero again?

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.310
Mr. Pei, you're actually right.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.270
Hu Xiu.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.150
Ms. Zhou.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.030
Where have you been?

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.840
This is such an important event,

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.840
and you're late.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.900
I was busy inspecting...

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.720
Here's the dress prepared for you.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.720
Put it on quickly.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.920
Tonight's banquet

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.550
has all the big names in the industry.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.150
It's a big day for our studio.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.300
Look your best.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.080
Okay.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.000
So you graduated from
Cornell University, Mr. Xiao.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:24.900
That's impressive.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.810
I used to visit friends there
all the time.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.910
Maybe we even saw each other back then.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:29.670
Maybe.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.550
What a coincidence, Mr. Xiao.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.150
I also graduated from Cornell.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.720
Could I add you on WeChat?

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:35.480
I'm sorry.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.410
My phone is charging in the lounge.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.950
This is a 2013 Dom Pérignon.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:45.870
It's quite good.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:46.920
Try it.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:47.710
Cheers.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.320
Excuse me,

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.050
Mr. Xiao will be giving a speech later.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.650
Let me drink this one for him.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:46.150
Mr. Xiao,

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.840
who is she?

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.400
I'm Mr. Xiao's employee,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:50.910
Hu Xiu,

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.840
assistant architect at Dynamism.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.720
Mr. Xiao needs to go prepare first.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.460
Please wait a moment.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.450
I believe Mr. Xiao's speech

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.740
will definitely not disappoint you all.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:10.900
Excuse us.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.080
Only Hu Xiu could

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.340
have gotten you out of there.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.030
Otherwise, who knows

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.910
how long you'd still be
stuck talking to them?

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.790
I have to say,

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.210
in that dress, you and Mr. Xiao

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.870
look pretty well-matched.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.030
Last time you said

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.890
you wanted to find a supplier
of 3D printing materials.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:36.700
I found one.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.480
Do you remember

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.550
the ceramic art factory

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.360
I mentioned before?

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:47.840
I looked into it.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.480
Their technology is not a problem,

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.750
but they do need to overcome
the production capacity issue

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.030
we discussed earlier.

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.170
However, as long as we pay in full upfront

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.660
and don't let them bear the cost pressure,

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.120
they'll fully cooperate.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.220
So this is
what you've been busy with lately?

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.480
If we can't pay in full upfront,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.410
I can communicate with them again.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.410
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:09.940
good evening.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:11.510
First, on behalf of Lyman,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.750
I'd like to welcome and thank

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.620
all of you for being here.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:19.450
[Lyman Group · Future Living ·
Celebration Banquet]

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.270
The design competition
for our company's resort community

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.790
has attracted enormous attention.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:24.550
Mr. Xiao Zhiyu

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.480
from Dynamism

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:29.000
has won over the judges

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:30.960
with his bold and brilliant proposal

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.760
and has become the chief designer
of this project.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.030
I believe

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.300
that once this project is completed,

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.120
it will surely become

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.210
another shining landmark
in the architectural field!

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:46.720
Furthermore,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.200
I'd like to sincerely thank

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.630
all other companies
that participated in the competition.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.990
Although we didn't get to
cooperate this time,

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.170
there will be opportunities in the future.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.530
We sincerely hope

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.080
to cooperate and achieve mutual success
with all of you.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.080
Now, let's invite

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.680
Mr. Xiao Zhiyu, the chief designer

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.510
of the Lyman Resort Community,

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:05.480
to the stage.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.880
It is an honor

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.550
to stand here

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.160
on behalf of Dynamism.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.480
Our studio will do our utmost

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.440
to live up to everyone's trust,

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.920
making this project a classic masterpiece.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.480
Taking advantage of
this important occasion,

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.880
I'd also like to announce

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.220
a major decision on behalf of our studio.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.550
Dynamism

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.350
has already signed

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.590
a project cooperation letter of intent
with Zhuling Group.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.510
We'll officially begin cooperation
after the New Year

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.570
to jointly complete the construction
of this project.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.180
That factory director's former chauffeur

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.030
became a building materials supplier.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.440
The powerful backer he latched onto

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.960
is Zhuling Group.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:15.020
Hu Xiu?

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.960
Ms. Zhou.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.070
So you just came from

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.000
the supplier.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.130
You've worked hard.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.340
Not hard at all,

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.340
just doing my job.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.960
I just didn't expect

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.740
that Mr. Xiao had already made
the decision.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.340
The cooperation with Zhuling

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.990
was only finalized
right before today's banquet.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.470
I was also surprised

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.580
when Mr. Xiao told me about it.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.160
I figured as much—

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.680
if we're working with Zhuling,

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.350
they would definitely use
their supplier resources

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.550
as a bargaining chip.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.250
But what I didn't expect was

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.480
that Mr. Pei would make
such excessive demands.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.680
He's after the entire Lyman's project.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.600
What I least expected was

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.000
that Mr. Xiao would actually accept it.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.790
However,

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.170
looking at it from another angle,

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.720
the two companies
working together peacefully

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.050
might not be a bad thing.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.070
Besides,

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.830
Mr. Xie and Mr. Pei
have a good relationship,

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.760
which will help the project
progress more smoothly.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:09.680
I understand.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.520
Go grab something to eat.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.320
See you later.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.020
Thank you.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.770
You're here to see Mr. Xiao
about something urgent?

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:39.680
Just some minor matters at the studio.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.850
It was about the supplier, wasn't it?

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.720
I know

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.120
you've been looking for new suppliers.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.200
But clearly,

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.790
no matter how hard you look,

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.160
you won't find anyone more suitable
than Zhuling.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.920
You're quite confident, Mr. Pei.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.880
Do you really think

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.010
you can control
the entire supply chain in the industry?

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.110
You're wrong.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.150
We don't need to.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.070
We can't monopolize
the entire industry's supply.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.030
What we can do

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.530
is keep the best part

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.770
for ourselves,

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.090
and that's enough.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.440
And your boss, Mr. Xiao,

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.810
he's indeed a clear-headed,
decisive businessman.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.490
Especially in this matter,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.130
he knows when to bend and when to stand.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.740
Your company is the one

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:22.010
seeking this work.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.120
If we're talking about
who truly knows how to "bend,"

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.850
I'd say you're the master at it.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.070
It was your boss who willingly chose to
work with me.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:29.930
The word "bend"

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.670
doesn't even apply here.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.750
Using supplier resources

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.070
in exchange for project cooperation—

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.200
the cooperation opportunity
you schemed so hard to get—

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.570
and you still say it wasn't "bending"?

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:49.440
Alright, Ms. Hu,

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.140
let's not debate anymore.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.740
May I have the honor of this dance?

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.480
We're about to become partners.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.610
You wouldn't deny me this courtesy,
would you?

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.880
In that case,

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.960
I shall respectfully comply.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.210
I'm fine.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.480
Is this your first time dancing, Ms. Hu?

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:54.520
Of course not.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.070
You don't seem very practiced.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.000
I can only work with what I'm given.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.540
Well then, I'd better perform well

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.060
so as not to hold you back.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.880
Excuse me, everyone. Sorry to interrupt.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.640
In terms of construction,

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.830
Zhuling has always been
an industry leader.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.110
Our studio is also very honored

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:28.570
to collaborate with them.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.440
Taking advantage of this occasion today,

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.840
I'd like to invite Mr. Pei

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.690
to give a speech on behalf of Zhuling.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.640
Why do you still look so glum?

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.680
I'm not.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.320
Oh, right,

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.030
Ms. Zhou,

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.400
thank you for preparing this dress for me.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.200
Otherwise, I would've
embarrassed myself badly again today.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.510
I didn't prepare it.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.650
Mr. Xiao asked me to bring it to you.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.010
Why are you out here alone?

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.000
There are too many people inside.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.930
It's too stuffy.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.480
When did you make the decision?

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.240
Mr. Xie,

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.410
do you have time to meet today?

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.620
I'd like to introduce someone to you.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.270
Sure.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.210
Come to my office tonight.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.400
Okay.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.960
I never expected

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:23.510
that you two

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.400
had such a connection.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.160
Zhiyu has been independent since childhood

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.720
and never wanted support from the family,

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.720
so we didn't

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.960
make it public.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:34.510
You could have relied on

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.480
a major corporation like Zhuling,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.340
yet you insisted on
striking out on your own.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.200
Mr. Xiao,

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.680
you never cease to amaze me.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:43.640
Mr. Xie,

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.640
my studio and Zhuling

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.970
have no financial or equity connections.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
My relationship with the Pei family

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.080
won't affect
the project's progress either.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.880
You can hire a supervision agency

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.240
to oversee the construction process

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.030
and ensure our cooperation is
fair and transparent.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:57.880
Uncle Xie,

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.350
Zhuling

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.310
attaches great importance to
Lyman's project this time.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:02.210
Please rest assured—

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.800
we will commit our best resources

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.260
to complete this project.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:09.580
In the company, only you know about

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.830
my relationship with the Pei family.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:12.590
You've been

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.350
working so hard to find suppliers
these past few days

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.230
because you didn't want to see me
bow to Zhuling,

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:17.800
right?

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.000
I'm sorry

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.060
I didn't tell you about
my decision earlier.

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:32.510
No need to apologize.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:33.960
I just didn't expect

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.370
that you would actually
cooperate with Zhuling.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.520
What did Pei Zhen say to you?

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:43.960
He said

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.550
you know when to bend and when to stand.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:51.850
Then...

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.880
what do you think?

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:04.720
I think...

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.440
I think since you've made this choice,

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.780
it must be absolutely necessary,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.500
not just a last resort.

to cooperate with Zhuling.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:59.960
Uncle Pei was just saying

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.750

work together toward the same goal.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.160
Everyone, come get your gift boxes
before leaving work!

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.620
There's one for everyone!

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.830
We get two gift boxes this year?

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:20.560
What is this?

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.240
We just landed a big project,

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.510
so Ms. Zhou and Mr. Xiao
must be feeling generous.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:25.370
-Right.
-Yeah.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.750
Let me open it and take a look.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:27.550
All done.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.220
Time for vacation!

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.610
I'm almost done too.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.880
Once I finish organizing the materials
for our post–New Year work

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.790
with Zhuling, I'll email them to you.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:36.270
Okay.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.350
Let me try to snag a train ticket first.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.480
I'll check it later.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.310
Mr. Xiao,

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.930
how are you planning to
spend the New Year?

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.240
Just like any other day.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.300
What about you?

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.680
My parents used to come to the lane
to celebrate the New Year with me.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.610
It's kind of our family tradition.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.880
We feel the old house
has a more festive atmosphere.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.310
It's close to downtown after all,

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.790
so it's very convenient
to see the lanterns.

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.390
Just a ten-minute walk or so.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.070
Perfect.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.880
I won't be staying in the lane
during the New Year.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.540
Feel free to use it as you like.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.150
I was going to ask
if you'd like to join us.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.170
Happy New Year.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.210
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.310
Li, happy New Year!

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:30.310
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:31.400
Here, eight-treasure rice pudding.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.030
Great.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.070
I get to taste
your eight-treasure rice pudding again!

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.830
Thank you, thank you.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:35.830
You're welcome.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:36.200
Alright, alright.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.060
Happy New Year.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.400
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.400
Thank you.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.350
Hu!

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.350
Happy New Year. Happy New Year!

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.080
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.640
Be careful!

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.030
Granny, happy New Year.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:50.880
You're in such good health.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.590
You came back to spend
the New Year with Xiu?

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:54.350
Yes, yes.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.320
Oh, right,

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.240
this is eight-treasure rice pudding
we made ourselves.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.170
Please try some.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.310
Okay, okay.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.370
I'll be right back.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:02.680
Her favorite.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.580
Happy New Year.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.510
The lanterns look really nice.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.030
Yeah.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:10.720
They're more festive.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.440
Mr. Hu?

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:12.480
Happy New Year!

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.480
Happy New Year.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:14.830
Dad,

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.590
it's been a while since you greeted anyone
like that, right?

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:17.030
Yes.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.920
After walking around, I can see
things really have changed a lot.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.640
Help me check

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.510
if these are straight on both sides.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:23.570
The one on the right

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:24.310
needs to move a bit to the left...

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.920
Xiu!

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:26.440
Xiaorou is video calling you

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.270
to wish our family a happy New Year.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.600
Okay, I'm going inside.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:30.920
Egg dumplings!

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.010
-Granny made them.
-They are my favorite!

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.240
Zhao!

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.070
Happy New Year!

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.440
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.270
That new cardigan
looks really nice on you.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:44.270
We bought it together last time
we went shopping, right?

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.110
That's the one.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.440
It looks really nice.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.240
Isn't it good?

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:48.680
Uncle Hu, Auntie Bai,

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.750
happy New Year.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.590
Wishing you good health.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.830
Thank you, Xiaorou.
Happy New Year to you too!

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.590
We're preparing the New Year's Eve dinner.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:58.160
Are you at your own place
or at your parents'?

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.110
Guangming and I are at my parents' place.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.830
I wish you

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:01.750
success in your career

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.070
and that you and Zhao achieve
financial freedom soon,

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.920
so I can share in your good fortune.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.000
Thanks for the good wishes.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.640
Xiaorou,

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.590
well,

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.400
I wish you young lovebirds

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.350
a smooth new year

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.690
and hope you have a child soon.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.400
Thank you, Uncle.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.510
Thank you, Uncle.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.680
Um, Xiaorou,

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.290
let me wish your parents
a happy New Year too.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.160
Sure, I'll go get them.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.290
You elders can chat.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.160
I'll go make some tangyuan.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:27.920
Xiu, make one with sugar filling.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:28.160
Alright.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:28.880
For good fortune.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.720
Sure thing.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.160
Hello, hello.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:49.890
Did you ask Zhiyu to come for dinner?

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.880
This year, our whole family is in China.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.400
We should have
a family reunion dinner together.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.270
I asked him.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.980
I've been busy cooking

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.260
and haven't had time to check WeChat yet.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.440
That must be Zhiyu.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:12.270
Zhiyu?

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:13.680
Uncle Xu,

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:14.890
happy New Year.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.400
You're Ms. Xiao Wanyue, right?

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.480
This is for you.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.200
Mom,

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:26.880
I sent you some gifts,

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.720
and I won't be joining you for dinner.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.310
Wishing you a happy Spring Festival

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.240
and good health.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.480
Look at you,

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.160
you really didn't need to buy all these.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.560
I still haven't finished

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.070
the liquor you gave me

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.510
last New Year.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:45.720
I didn't expect

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.200
you'd come.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.160
I heard earlier that your mother was
coming back to Shanghai this year,

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.620
and I thought you would...

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.610
By the way,

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.000
you landed a big project,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.400
and I haven't
properly congratulated you yet.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.110
Wait a moment.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.240
I'll prepare some food,

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.030
and we can have a drink.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:00.640
Uncle Xu.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.880
I'm just stopping by.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.720
Please don't trouble yourself.

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:08.590
I saw you on the TV news.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.480
The way you looked

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.940
on that competition stage

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.240
really resembled your father.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.570
If he were still here,

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.640
he would be so proud of you.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.680
So many years have passed.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.960
You're no longer
that little boy from back then.

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:30.550
Uncle Xu,

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.410
I've always remembered
what you said back then.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.750
Listen to your uncle.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:38.350
Don't rush.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.350
You're still young.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.160
You and your mother

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.550
have finally adapted to life in America.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:46.610
At a time like this,

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:48.230
you can't act on impulse.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.370
Your father wouldn't want you
to be reckless either,

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:50.960
right?

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.920
So there's nothing I can do?

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:55.920
There's one thing you can do.

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:57.750
Grow up well.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.200
When you're an adult

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.680
and have the ability and resources,

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.790
only then will you have the chance
to unravel everything

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.120
and discover the truth.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:09.360
Uncle Xu,

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:11.400
I'll grow up quickly.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.080
Sooner or later, I'll prove

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.130
my father's innocence.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.150
Good boy.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:22.360
Zhiyu,

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:23.550
you've grown

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:24.949
so much over these years.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.550
But sometimes I wonder

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.000
if what I said back then

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:32.750
planted a seed of revenge in you

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:35.030
that has affected

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.760
your life all these years.

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.760
Uncle Xu.

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:45.940
I'm one step closer to what I want to do.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.440
I won't give up.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:48.920
I know.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.620
You've always wanted to clear

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:51.980
your father's name.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.630
But I can't bear to see you

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.580
carrying such a heavy burden.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.440
I can't bear to see you risk everything.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.960
You're not young anymore.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.230
As your elder,

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.590
I'd rather see you living happily

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:11.730
with a family of your own.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.150

Mr. Xiao?

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.190
Didn't you say he wouldn't spend
New Year's in the lane?

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.710
Yeah, why is he here?

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:47.170
Young boss,

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:48.290
come up and join us.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:51.390
Mr. Xiao,

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:53.720
that lantern in your hand looks nice.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.980
Could you give it to me?

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:06.510
Mr. Xiao!

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:08.090
Happy New Year.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:10.800
Happy New Year, Uncle.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.760
Happy New Year.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.440
Let me see.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.550
A child passing by gave it to me.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.230
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.840
Why don't you come in for a while?

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.500
No, thanks.

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:21.800
You can't leave! You can't leave.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.510
It's New Year's.

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:23.110
Since you're already here,

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:24.030
how can you leave?

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.550
Besides, you're Xiu's boss.

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:26.030
Come on, come in.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.880
Come in. Come on.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.440
Come in, come in.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.070
Come in.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:29.530
Come on.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.960
Mom,

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:30.890
Mr. Xiao is here!

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:32.510
Hello, Auntie.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:33.000
Come on, have a seat.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.670
Hello.

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:34.360
Happy New Year.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.480
Please have a seat.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:38.620
Young boss,

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:39.480
it's New Year's.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.150
Why are you all alone?

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:42.660
Where are your parents?

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:44.280
Dad,

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.110
Mr. Xiao's family isn't in Shanghai.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:47.280
He's here by himself.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.960
How can someone spend the New Year alone?

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.400
Stay and have dinner with us.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.030
Besides,

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:52.590
you're renting our house,

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.230
so we should at least
show you some hospitality,

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.920
okay?

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:55.710
Yes, yes.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:56.840
Stay and have dinner with us.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.920
You chat with my dad here.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.980
I'll go help my mom.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.330
Have some dried fruits.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.360
Dad's attitude toward him
has changed so drastically.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:04.920
Later,

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.410
have a drink with me.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.860
I've got some good baijiu.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:16.290
It's hot.

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:19.570
Is it good?

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.510
Pour for the young boss first.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:40.230
Don't rush.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:42.490
Drinking on an empty stomach isn't good.

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:44.770
Let Mr. Xiao eat something first.

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:45.330
Auntie,

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.630
you can just call me Yu.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:47.920
Alright, Yu.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:49.630
That's enough. That's enough.

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.030
Let me fill your glass.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.480
Here,

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.400
have some "Fish for Prosperity."

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.400
This is your Uncle Hu's specialty.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.150
Try it and see if you like it.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:59.120
It's delicious.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.510
Actually, this dish

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:03.640
is really suitable for the young boss—

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.950
"Rising Higher and Higher."

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:05.620
Next year,

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.900
I wish you'd take on more big projects.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:08.900
Thank you, Uncle.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.750
Here.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.230
In previous years,

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:14.710
it was always just the three of us
celebrating the New Year.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:15.070
Yes, yes.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:16.710
This year we have one more person.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:18.110
It really feels different.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.030
Yes, yes.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.590
We should've had a son-in-law
joining us by now anyway,

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:21.150
right?

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:25.830
I'll go check if the tangyuan are ready.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:28.550
Why do you always have to
bring up sore subjects?

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:29.670
Didn't you bring it up first?

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.000
Is that what I meant?

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.230
Here come the tangyuan.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.670
Great!

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:36.430
Help yourselves.

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:37.230
Okay, okay.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:38.150
Mr. Xiao.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:41.510
This is our family's special tradition.

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:43.600
We hide one black sugar filling

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.190
among the five-nut tangyuan.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:46.110
Whoever gets it

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.040
will have good luck in the new year.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:48.670
Yes.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.920
Xiu will definitely get it first,

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:51.450
right?

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.280
Be sweet and happy,
and then find a good boyfriend.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:03.760
Young boss,

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.530
you're so lucky!

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.000
If you ask me,

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:09.550
our old family house

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:10.920
has great feng shui—

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.990
it's bringing you good fortune.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:13.800
It seems

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.420
good things will happen to you
this year, Yu.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:17.810
Maybe next New Year
you won't be alone anymore.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:20.140
Then I'll gladly accept your good wishes.

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:36.810
Come on, come on!

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:38.340
Come on, let's make a toast.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.400
Alright.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.400
Alright, come on.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.810
Come on, come on.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:43.320
Cheers!

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:45.230
Wishing everyone good health

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:47.320
and everything going smoothly
in the new year.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.030
Xiu,

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.550
let's leave last year where it belongs—

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:50.360
in the past.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.070
It's all in the past.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:52.710
It's all in the past.

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:53.970
It's all behind us now.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:54.960
Young boss,

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:56.440
I want to thank you too.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:57.360
You see, Xiu

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.800
now has a stable job,

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.390
and her life is back on track.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:01.300
It's all thanks to you.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.280
Here, I toast to you.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:02.880
Thank you.

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:03.970
Uncle, you're too kind.

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:04.490
Cheers.

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.760
Hu Xiu has actually helped me a lot.

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:10.110
Okay.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:11.360
Xiu,

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:13.630
well, these past few years,

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:14.280
you've

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.880
been through a lot.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:18.670
From now on,
your days will surely be peaceful,

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:20.190
smooth, and happy.

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.980
Okay.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:26.120
Mr. Xiao.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:31.030
Uncle is right.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:33.960
Hu Xiu,

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:35.980
I wish you a New Year...

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:41.410
free from all troubles.
