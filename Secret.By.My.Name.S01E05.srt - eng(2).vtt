00:00:09.312 --> 00:00:11.713
Get everyone from Tan Zuoyan's department
together right now.

00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:14.312
Call an emergency meeting
for the Autumn Winter Alpine Collection.

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:15.033
You!

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:18.633
So, are you going

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:20.473
or not?

00:00:24.193 --> 00:00:25.112
Just so you know,

00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:28.233
there are plenty of people
eyeing this project.

00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:30.673
Alright, Zuoyan.

00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:32.311
Just focus on your work for now.

00:00:32.312 --> 00:00:33.632
Work comes first.

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:37.673
I'll do whatever you say.

00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:52.073
Where did he touch you?

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:52.912
Here?

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:53.833
Here?

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:55.233
Or here?

00:00:55.592 --> 00:00:57.952
Li Shujing. What exactly are you trying to do?

00:00:59.153 --> 00:01:00.272
What is it?

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:03.233
I'm Zuoyan's fiancée.

00:01:03.553 --> 00:01:04.991
Isn't the wedding

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:06.833
something we have to prepare for
sooner or later?

00:01:07.153 --> 00:01:09.272
I know exactly
what is really going on between you two.

00:01:09.312 --> 00:01:11.032
Does telling this lie
even mean anything?

00:01:12.432 --> 00:01:13.993
This could be a lie,

00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:15.513
or it could be the truth.

00:01:16.193 --> 00:01:17.433
Why not

00:01:17.553 --> 00:01:19.832
give me everything I want?

00:01:20.152 --> 00:01:21.513
Can you do that?

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:25.552
If you can,

00:01:25.872 --> 00:01:27.153
I promise,

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:28.752
at the wedding,

00:01:29.352 --> 00:01:31.032
I'll wear only the shackles you gave me.

00:01:37.393 --> 00:01:37.912
Didn't you

00:01:37.913 --> 00:01:40.073
want to put these shackles on me
eight years ago?

00:01:42.953 --> 00:01:45.752
Now you're the one wearing them,

00:01:46.913 --> 00:01:49.472
while watching me walk the red carpet

00:01:51.792 --> 00:01:53.273
over the Tan Group's ruin.

00:01:54.753 --> 00:01:55.913
You want to play with fire?

00:01:57.792 --> 00:01:59.032
I can burn the entire Tan Group

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:00.433
into your bridal chamber.

00:02:01.072 --> 00:02:02.192
But remember,

00:02:03.352 --> 00:02:04.952
the ones locked in these flames

00:02:05.512 --> 00:02:07.392
will only be two dead people,
you and me.

00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:28.379
=Secret By My Name=

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.192
(Adapted from the novel
Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

00:02:30.193 --> 00:02:31.111
=Episode 5=
You little shorty,

00:02:31.112 --> 00:02:32.951
=Episode 5=
why are you picking a fight with me?

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.353
You grew taller but not any smarter.

00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:36.320
Playing deaf and mute
with me every single day, are you?

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.592
Who are you calling brainless?

00:02:37.593 --> 00:02:39.111
Li Shujing, are you out of your mind?

00:02:39.112 --> 00:02:40.472
Who are you calling crazy?

00:02:40.473 --> 00:02:41.391
Lin Xi, listen.

00:02:41.392 --> 00:02:43.032
Stop playing innocent.

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:45.200
You only got where you are
by being Tan Jianfei's living seal.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.073
Do you really think
you are the Group's lucky charm now?

00:02:47.232 --> 00:02:48.032
Miss Li.

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:49.160
How noble you must be.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.192
With trash drafts like this,
you are worse than a third-rate designer,

00:02:51.193 --> 00:02:52.511
and you're trying to apply
for a top-level patent?

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:53.872
Do you really think Tan Group
belongs to your family?

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:55.992
I will ask one last time.
Are you signing this or not?

00:02:55.993 --> 00:02:58.032
I am not signing it. No!

00:02:58.033 --> 00:02:59.600
Even if Tan Jianfei comes,
I'm not signing.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.992
Sign it or do not, I do not care.

00:03:23.193 --> 00:03:25.593
Li Shujing is a madwoman!

00:03:26.392 --> 00:03:27.552
Tan Jianfei.

00:03:27.713 --> 00:03:29.231
So this is the kind of crazy woman

00:03:29.232 --> 00:03:30.800
you rejected my engagement
for back then?

00:03:32.352 --> 00:03:33.392
Is it interesting?

00:03:34.993 --> 00:03:37.672
That crazy woman treats me
like a live target.

00:03:37.713 --> 00:03:39.473
And you call this interesting?

00:03:39.753 --> 00:03:41.872
Do you still want me
to do this project for you?

00:03:41.913 --> 00:03:43.593
The project is yours.

00:03:44.232 --> 00:03:46.313
But I am quite interested
in watching this show.

00:03:47.392 --> 00:03:48.793
Let me remind you of one thing.

00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:50.633
Li Shujing

00:03:51.153 --> 00:03:52.832
is not someone to mess with.

00:03:53.072 --> 00:03:54.432
Tan Jianfei.

00:03:54.512 --> 00:03:57.032
Are you using me
to deal with Li Shujing,

00:03:57.033 --> 00:03:59.272
or throwing me out there
for her to shoot at?

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:01.593
What exactly is going on
with this project?

00:04:04.512 --> 00:04:05.312
Hang in there.

00:04:05.313 --> 00:04:05.952
Hang...

00:04:08.753 --> 00:04:09.593
Hey!

00:04:11.232 --> 00:04:12.392
Please move.

00:04:13.832 --> 00:04:15.272
Tan Jianfei!

00:04:15.753 --> 00:04:17.432
Hang in there, my foot!

00:04:17.433 --> 00:04:20.353
It makes me so mad!

00:04:20.353 --> 00:04:22.431
That woman launched
a charity collaboration and took away

00:04:22.432 --> 00:04:24.233
seventy percent of our pre-sales.

00:04:24.432 --> 00:04:26.713
She monopolizes fabric suppliers
under the banner of charity.

00:04:26.752 --> 00:04:28.833
The whole industry is siding with her.

00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:30.231
Even the board is pressuring me.

00:04:30.232 --> 00:04:32.280
They force me to halt
the Autumn Winter Alpine project.

00:04:32.513 --> 00:04:37.393
Tan Jianfei went all out
just to keep me away from this project.

00:04:41.153 --> 00:04:42.273
This is infuriating.

00:04:42.593 --> 00:04:43.872
Calm down.

00:04:43.913 --> 00:04:45.191
Her so-called ethical business

00:04:45.192 --> 00:04:46.432
is far from spotless.

00:04:49.073 --> 00:04:49.913
Look.

00:04:50.153 --> 00:04:51.632
The rural factories she partners with

00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:53.032
cannot meet production at all.

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:54.551
Those so-called handwoven textiles

00:04:54.552 --> 00:04:55.300
(Revealing the Fraud Behind the Rural
Poverty-Relief Weaving Factory)

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.551
(and the Shell-Company Shareholding Structure)

00:04:55.552 --> 00:04:57.111
are actually mass-produced goods

00:04:57.112 --> 00:04:59.033
repackaged from overseas factories.

00:05:00.112 --> 00:05:00.992
Hold on.

00:05:02.225 --> 00:05:04.332
(Xijie Apparel Legal Representative:
Tan Jianfei 75%)

00:05:05.192 --> 00:05:06.849
This company's legal representative...

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.582
(Xijie Apparel Legal Representative:
Tan Jianfei 75%)

00:05:09.033 --> 00:05:10.311
This is a shell company

00:05:10.312 --> 00:05:11.992
controlled by Tan Jianfei.

00:05:13.992 --> 00:05:17.473
Lin Xi is claiming the moral high ground
to clean up Tan Group's image.

00:05:19.073 --> 00:05:20.832
Send all this to the media immediately.

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:22.231
There is more.

00:05:22.232 --> 00:05:25.833
The so-called poverty relief workshop
in her promo shut down two years ago.

00:05:26.913 --> 00:05:29.040
We can find a few former workers
and put them on camera.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.072
We will tear apart her
carefully crafted charity image.

00:05:32.232 --> 00:05:33.632
Even so,

00:05:34.153 --> 00:05:35.231
we still cannot

00:05:35.232 --> 00:05:36.992
reclaim the Autumn Winter Alpine project.

00:05:37.552 --> 00:05:38.472
And we may be facing

00:05:38.473 --> 00:05:40.153
an even fiercer backlash from them.

00:05:42.192 --> 00:05:43.752
The top priority now

00:05:44.273 --> 00:05:46.793
is to find her weakness
as soon as possible.

00:06:04.352 --> 00:06:05.632
She drew this family portrait

00:06:06.073 --> 00:06:07.872
when she was seven.

00:06:08.393 --> 00:06:10.672
She didn't finish the old man's face.

00:06:11.432 --> 00:06:13.273
Do you think she already sensed

00:06:13.953 --> 00:06:15.552
that Tan Group would one day

00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:17.233
drive her family to ruin?

00:06:24.513 --> 00:06:25.512
You still love

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:28.072
digging through old trash,

00:06:28.232 --> 00:06:29.551
just like you did

00:06:29.552 --> 00:06:31.473
when you stole her diary back then.

00:06:33.273 --> 00:06:35.033
You were the one who said

00:06:35.633 --> 00:06:37.593
Shujing would marry me one day,

00:06:38.192 --> 00:06:39.473
and I had to protect her.

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:41.872
Now you say
you want to marry her yourself.

00:06:44.593 --> 00:06:45.593
Zuoyan,

00:06:46.752 --> 00:06:48.393
your acting is terrible.

00:06:48.872 --> 00:06:50.473
A performance this clumsy

00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:52.353
will not last very long.

00:07:00.073 --> 00:07:01.432
Well,

00:07:01.833 --> 00:07:03.112
people change.

00:07:03.552 --> 00:07:04.552
Back then,

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:07.751
the old man was set on
making me inherit Tan Group.

00:07:07.752 --> 00:07:09.072
But what happened later?

00:07:10.273 --> 00:07:11.473
He changed.

00:07:12.312 --> 00:07:13.833
Shujing changed too.

00:07:16.273 --> 00:07:17.791
She will not love you anymore.

00:07:17.792 --> 00:07:19.472
She will marry me,

00:07:19.473 --> 00:07:21.473
and the one who protects her will be me.

00:07:22.552 --> 00:07:23.832
The way you protect her

00:07:23.833 --> 00:07:25.820
is by turning her into
a sacrifice of the Tan family.

00:07:25.872 --> 00:07:27.512
Do you even know what you are doing?

00:07:28.312 --> 00:07:29.872
If she were to find out

00:07:29.992 --> 00:07:32.072
that you do not carry Tan blood at all,

00:07:32.352 --> 00:07:33.952
do you think she would stay with you?

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.913
Do you think she cares about that?

00:07:36.752 --> 00:07:38.272
She has known everything
for a long time.

00:07:38.273 --> 00:07:40.552
And yet she still chose to marry me. Why?

00:07:40.633 --> 00:07:41.351
Because only I can.

00:07:41.352 --> 00:07:42.752
Only me.

00:07:43.192 --> 00:07:45.512
I am the only one
who can give her what she wants most.

00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:58.432
What you want most is nothing more than
what little the Tan family has left.

00:07:59.552 --> 00:08:00.952
What Shujing wants

00:08:00.953 --> 00:08:02.871
is for the entire Tan family
to be wiped out.

00:08:02.872 --> 00:08:04.192
-And me... -And you.

00:08:04.672 --> 00:08:06.351
The bloodline of the Tan family
she hates most

00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:08.793
is flowing through your veins.

00:08:10.393 --> 00:08:11.393
Jianfei,

00:08:11.473 --> 00:08:13.033
every time you touch her,

00:08:13.073 --> 00:08:15.312
what do you feel?

00:08:15.552 --> 00:08:18.992
Is it her warmth,

00:08:19.752 --> 00:08:23.153
or the rough feel of the rope
your father used to strangle her father?

00:08:56.873 --> 00:08:59.071
Li Shujing, I can't stand you anymore.

00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:00.632
You asked me out and still showed up

00:09:01.113 --> 00:09:01.792
late...

00:09:04.113 --> 00:09:05.112
Who are you?

00:09:05.113 --> 00:09:06.193
Where is Li Shujing?

00:09:15.353 --> 00:09:17.193
Mr. Tan,

00:09:17.633 --> 00:09:19.473
you don't look like
you're here to talk business.

00:09:20.113 --> 00:09:21.953
This drink is called Thorn Kiss.

00:09:22.873 --> 00:09:24.272
Tell me,

00:09:24.273 --> 00:09:26.193
does it taste anything like

00:09:27.312 --> 00:09:29.440
the Wild Lemon you forced into my mouth
when we were eighteen?

00:09:31.072 --> 00:09:33.433
So are you pretending to be drunk?

00:09:35.233 --> 00:09:36.872
Too bad you are this wasted,

00:09:38.552 --> 00:09:40.353
you cannot even mix a proper drink.

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:42.152
You really should learn
from your brother.
