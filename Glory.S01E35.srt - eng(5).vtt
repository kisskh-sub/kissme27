00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.789
[Glory]

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.930
[Episode 35]

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.970
Yunshu is managing things quite well.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.150
He's not back yet?

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.070
Yes.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.140
Jun Dai just reported that

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.660
Mr. Lu was asked by Master Shuyu

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.720
to stay for dinner,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.979
and you don't need to wait for him.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.430
This Duke of Yongguo

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.090
is quite calculating indeed.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.210
He's found a way

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.070
to control his son

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.310
so quickly.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.070
My Lady, you mean...

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.970
First, luring with benefits,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.830
then pressuring with authority.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.150
When neither worked,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.030
he appealed to emotions,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.530
using me as a pawn to steady Jianglai,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.630
and finally resorted to

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.890
fox-hunting tactics.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.150
When the trap catches the young fox,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.240
how can the mother fox

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.710
bear to escape alone?

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.490
If the mother doesn't work,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.840
there's still the brother and nephew.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.910
One of these baits will surely work.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.840
Lu Jianglai,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.540
you've been clever all your life,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.260
yet you still fell for
the old hunter's trap.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.030
Pack the luggage.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.120
I'll set off back to Linji

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.920
early tomorrow morning.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.120
My Lady.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.590
Cheers.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.820
Let me toast you again.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.230
I'm sorry for what I did.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.140
That day when we talked,

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.680
I kept mentioning Madam Han.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.840
I was just acting proud
of my legitimate son status,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.240
trying to gain a bit of face
in front of you.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.960
Legitimate son?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.720
What kind of legitimate son am I?

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.800
What woman

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.430
could raise her husband's

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.230
son born by another woman

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.330
without any resentment

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.840
and treat him as her own?

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.750
True.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.520
Clothing,

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.870
food,

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.560
shelter and travel—

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.030
she never mistreated me in any way.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.850
She wouldn't allow anyone
to look down on me.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.560
But my wet nurses

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.570
never stayed longer than six months.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.270
Loyal servants didn't last long either.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.260
She couldn't bear to see me cry

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.830
and even less
could she bear to see me smile.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.390
Perhaps inside

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.160
she suffered more than I did.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.070
As for Father,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.930
before I was badly injured
from falling off a horse,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.190
he had high hopes for me.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.240
He said I was his proudest son

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.490
and the future hope of the Xue family.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.160
But once this leg was broken,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.870
everything changed.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.560
Nobody cares about me anymore.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.720
This leg aches to the bone

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.190
whenever it rains or the wind blows.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.420
Mother should have

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.310
taken me with her back then.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.400
I'd have had my own mother

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.580
and brother.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.200
I would have had a home.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.360
Shuyu,

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.190
you do have a home.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.910
As long as
you treat your wife well from now on

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.840
and raise your children with care,

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.050
sooner or later

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.690
you will earn their forgiveness.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.170
Don't wait until it's too late

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.600
to regret what you've done.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.450
Shuyu.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:37.440
Shuyu.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.120
Take good care of him.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.980
Yes.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.800
Master Jianglai, you're drunk.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.070
Watch your step.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.360
Let's go.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.280
Princess Jinxiang heard
that Master Shuyu is ill

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.190
and ordered me to deliver

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.420
this calming medicinal soup,

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.530
insisting that Master Shuyu must take it.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:54.860
Thanks for her concern.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.070
Master Shuyu has already taken ginger soup

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:57.950
and is not seriously ill.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.550
I'll report it
after he sobers up from the wine.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.600
This medicinal soup

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.200
can be kept warm on the stove.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.150
After parting today,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.860
may your worries fade,

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.330
troubles stay far,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.929
joy be constant,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.460
fortune and longevity increase,

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.610
Buddha bless you for good health,

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:44.570
and a good match be found soon.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.690
[To Mr. Lu]

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:27.570
What are you doing?

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.860
Let me see what you're hiding.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:47.300
Bao,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.770
what do you mean by this?

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.150
Legend has it

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.030
when Sima Xiangru parted from Zhuo Wenjun,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.120
he wrote down

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.670
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.070
hundred, thousand, ten thousand and so on,

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.000
without "yi" (hundred million)
meaning without love.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.960
I thought it over

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.750
and couldn't write a proper farewell note.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.210
So I left the letter blank,

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:10.510
only returning

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.710
what you once gave me.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.380
Isn't the intention clear enough?

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.380
-You...
-My Lord!

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.030
My lord!

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.080
Master Shuyu...

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.010
Master Shuyu...

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.740
is dead.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.150
Jianglai!

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.270
Lady Shanbao,

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.630
the carriage is waiting outside.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.030
Send someone
to deliver a message to Yunshu,

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.440
asking her to come immediately.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.170
Just in case,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.400
gather all the reliable people

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.660
we have in the capital.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.000
Lady Shanbao,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.920
the boats at the dock are ready.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.070
Old Madam is still in Linji,

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:51.960
eagerly awaiting

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.360
-your return.
-Go ahead.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:54.670
Yes.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.120
Your Highness, it was him.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.240
Last night, Master Jianglai

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.910
was drinking and talking
with Master Shuyu.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:47.550
I don't know what they discussed.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.410
After Master Shuyu went to sleep,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.500
Master Jianglai left.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.260
The next morning,

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.040
Master Shuyu was still in bed.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.960
I thought he hadn't
sobered up from the wine,

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.870
but when I tried to wake him,

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.970
his body was already stiff.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.870
Your Highness,
if you want to interrogate someone,

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.800
please question Master Jianglai.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.480
Jianglai,

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.480
what did you and Master Shuyu talk about?

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.080
How could he end up like this?

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:13.880
Last night...

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.320
Last night we talked about

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.720
our childhood memories.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.280
Shuyu drank too much,

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.290
so I helped him lie down

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.000
told the servant
to take good care of him,

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.720
and then I left.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:33.600
I don't know

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.130
what happened afterwards.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.010
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.840
Even a vicious tiger doesn't eat its cubs.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.100
No matter how much I despise him,

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.000
I would never

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.750
harm my own child.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.720
Someone in this room

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.590
is lying!

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.510
Jun Dai!

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.240
Bring the coroner

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.840
that Lang Zhusheng brought!

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.260
I want an autopsy.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:14.460
Outrageous!

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:16.630
Your father is still sitting right here.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.080
How dare you give orders!

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.670
After your brother injured his leg,

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.240
his temperament changed drastically,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.040
hiding in this room all day long.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.080
His leg wound wouldn't heal,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.170
and his anxiety became an illness
that no medicine could cure.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.120
That's why he died suddenly
in the middle of the night.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.270
The men of my Xue family

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.600
either die on the battlefield

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.000
or on their way to war.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.080
None of them has ever

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.840
died so pathetically

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.040
and so ingloriously!

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.510
Now you want to call for an autopsy.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:46.870
Do you want to spread this

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.720
for everyone to know,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.480
telling the whole world

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.000
that I have

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.510
a useless, crippled son?

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.320
What if I insist on an autopsy?

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.240
How dare you!

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.240
Lady Rong Shanbao,

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.100
you can't go in.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:09.630
Well,

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.270
my own son

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:13.710
is conspiring with outsiders

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.000
to rebel against me.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.160
Rong Shanbao,

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.440
do you think the Duke's Mansion

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.270
is some place

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.030
where you can barge in as you please

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.230
with such impudence?

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.030
Go.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:26.840
I forbid it!

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.950
Your Highness, may we examine him now?

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.510
Go ahead.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.750
Your Highness, Lord Lu,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.240
I have examined the body.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.320
Apart from eight whip marks on the back,

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.520
there are no injuries

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.830
on any other part of the body or the head.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.190
A silver needle
inserted into the deceased's throat

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.550
came out bright and clean,

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.810
so the deceased did not die of poisoning.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.870
Not poison, not physical assault.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:03.910
Then how exactly...

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.270
How did he actually die?

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.500
Your Highness,

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.840
based on my examination

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.200
of the body's condition,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.720
Master Shuyu died suddenly

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.910
from an acute illness during the night.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.040
It wasn't foul play?

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.320
No.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:21.840
Lady Shanbao,

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.030
the room, floor, and windows

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.070
have all been examined.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:24.960
No signs of struggle

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.490
or forced entry were found.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.650
Your Highness,

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.600
Master Shuyu retired at 9 p.m. last night.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.840
As he was usually a light sleeper,

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.320
servants were forbidden
to move about or cough,

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.750
fearing they might disturb his rest.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.320
The wine and food inside
were left untouched,

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.240
and these two kept watch
at the door all night,

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.840
seeing no one enter or leave.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.480
The concubines were not summoned

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.020
and remained in their own chambers.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.150
This morning at 7 a.m.,

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.080
Miss Ji Ping entered with her maid.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:47.960
Shortly after,

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.650
crying and wailing were heard from inside.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.410
Master Shuyu was truly heartless,

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.390
leaving me and our two children behind,

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.990
passing away just like that,

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.960
without even a final farewell.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.410
No wonder you called for a coroner.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.400
So it was sudden illness.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.790
In that case,

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:07.980
your suspicion of murder

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.880
is completely cleared.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.329
Princess Jinxiang, mind your words.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:21.200
Fratricide is punishable
by death by a thousand cuts.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.550
Don't make baseless accusations

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.000
against innocent people.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.880
Innocent?

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.069
Innocent,

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.640
your own brother

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.850
offered you the Duke's heir position,

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:32.200
while you pretended

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.350
to refuse it with false modesty,

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:35.640
acting as if titles and wealth

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.840
meant nothing to you.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.510
Who'd have thought you were secretly

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.440
plotting to kill your own brother?

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:41.640
This way,

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.480
the title rightfully

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.740
falls into your hands,

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:45.590
and you even gain

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.720
a reputation for brotherly devotion.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:48.750
Lu,

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.920
you're truly calculating

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:53.830
and vicious.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.490
You're talking nonsense.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.200
Father,

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.550
last night in the room,

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.270
there were only the two brothers.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.440
What happened

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.790
is entirely up to him to lie about.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.200
Besides, he once served as

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.920
an official in charge of criminal cases

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.960
and has handled

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.490
countless ruthless cases.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.280
Who knows how many
methods of murder are there

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.350
that a coroner can't detect?

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.070
My poor brother

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.180
was weak in character, pure and kind,

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.000
yet he treated a vicious wolf

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.640
as his own brother.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.110
Father,

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:33.280
no matter how flawed Shuyu was,

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.800
he was still your own son.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.480
You must not bestow the title

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.350
upon some

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.070
malicious outsider.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.070
Nonsense.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.030
These are all your baseless speculations.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:44.920
The coroner already stated

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.270
that your brother died of sudden illness.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.000
So many people were watching him.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.530
They couldn't all be lying.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.690
Don't speak such nonsense again.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:01.510
Ruiniang,

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.680
who told you to bring the children here?

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.410
Young Madam,

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.080
didn't you order to bring

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.510
Master Peixun and Lady Xuanyu

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:08.070
here?

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.400
I gave the order.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.030
Come.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:18.270
Father,

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.550
look at your grandson.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.290
He's only seven years old.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:23.720
And there's Xuanyu.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.260
She's also so innocent

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.200
and naive.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.400
This poor pair of children

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.920
rely entirely on your protection.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.960
Please forgive my bluntness.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.480
After all, in this world,

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.880
no one lives forever.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.350
One day, after you're gone,

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.460
whom can these innocent

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:45.790
young ones rely on?

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.720
In another year or two,

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:48.880
when our Xun

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.880
understands reason and propriety,

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.040
if he asks you, Grandfather,

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.350
why you gave the title to someone

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.350
who might have killed

00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.920
their own father,

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.830
Father, how will you

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.870
explain it to the children then?

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.960
Princess Jinxiang,
you spoke with hidden barbs,

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.960
so aggressively,

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.110
and kept mentioning titles and wealth.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.840
Don't worry.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.830
I don't care about the Duke's title,

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.060
nor do I want your Xue family's fortune.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.010
Come here. Come to Mother.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.930
Proving your innocence isn't hard.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.080
As long as Lu Jianglai

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.200
gives up wealth and power,

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.310
writes a letter severing family ties,

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.520
leaves the Duke of Yongguo's Mansion
from now on,

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.480
and has no connection whatsoever,
in life, death, poverty, or wealth.,

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.830
and even if you meet

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.240
Xun on the street in the future,

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.270
don't have the nerve

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.970
to call yourself his uncle,

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.650
then I'll believe that you're

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.590
not greedy for power or wealth,

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.410
that you're an innocent good person.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:57.820
Don't rush.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.400
Her words may seem absurd,

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.640
but she's actually setting traps,
pressing you step by step.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.790
She intends to frame you
for killing your brother.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:06.590
If you refuse,

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:08.790
she'll say you plotted for the title
and killed him.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:09.550
If you agree,

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:11.240
people will be even more suspicious

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.360
that you're the real murderer,

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.220
driven out of the Duke's Mansion.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.080
Whether you agree or not,

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.070
whether you inherit the title or not,

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.160
you'll face criticism either way.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:21.200
They'll call you

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.390
a villain who plotted
your brother's death.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.900
What a vicious scheme.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:30.720
Unless the truth about Shuyu's death

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.580
comes to light,

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.110
I absolutely will not

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.470
leave the Xue family now.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:36.330
Your Highness,

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:38.410
Shuyu never sent anyone to kill me.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.640
The assassination attempt the other night

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.100
was someone else's doing.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.240
This person deliberately

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.640
creates discord and hatred

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.270
between us brothers,

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.350
provoking us to kill each other

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.610
for their own benefit.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.870
I must expose this person.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:53.400
Fine. Then tell me,

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.540
who would dare do such a thing?

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.240
Were

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.270
the food and wine Master Shuyu consumed

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.530
last night all tested?

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:02.930
They were all checked.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.200
No poison or incompatible foods
were found.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.670
What about that bowl of ginger soup?

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:07.470
Ginger soup?

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.960
Well...

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.400
Earlier, when checking
and inventorying items,

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.800
no ginger soup was found.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.350
Wasn't it said that no one

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.010
entered Master Shuyu's room?

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.030
Then how did the leftover ginger soup

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.000
simply vanish into thin air?

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:22.830
Ji Ping,

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.610
did you deliver that bowl of ginger soup?

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:26.720
Yes,

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:27.880
that bowl of ginger soup

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.350
was indeed delivered by me.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.640
But whether he drank it or not,

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.640
how much he drank,

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.070
and who took away the bowl—

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.530
I have absolutely no idea.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:35.640
Last night,

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.750
Master Shuyu was incited by someone else

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:38.400
and drove me out

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.660
without explanation.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.310
I didn't understand then,

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.160
but thinking about it carefully now,

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.160
if someone deliberately
meant to harm Master Shuyu,

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:45.880
they'd certainly

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.270
want me out of the way.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.290
You're like a thief crying "Stop thief!"

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.490
Xue Sangui,

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.880
go search her room.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:57.780
Yes, sir.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:22:59.740
Let's go.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:19.550
You, with the coal braziers,

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.670
come here.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.920
I've said before

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.550
that you are not

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.810
a sentimental person.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.400
You'd overcome all obstacles to succeed.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.400
Vulnerability and melancholy
are rarely seen in you.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.550
Indeed.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:55.240
The same tradition
applies to the Rong family.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.900
As long as I'm not by your side,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.680
someone will immediately

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.510
take my place!

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:00.530
Will it be Cheng Guanyu

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.940
or your cousin Wen Can?

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.920
Could there be something wrong
with this brazier?

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.190
Master Shuyu was frail
and feared the cold.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.640
Every year at this time,

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.680
two braziers are added to his room,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.030
burning the finest silver-frost charcoal.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.490
Is there something wrong
with the charcoal?

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.440
Lady Shanbao, Lady Yunshu has arrived.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.510
Perfect. Invite her in.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.270
Yes.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.120
Our Xue family
is discussing private matters.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.480
We don't need the Rong family interfering.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.920
Princess Jinxiang, please remain calm.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.720
The person I've invited isn't an outsider,

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.520
but a witness.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:08.280
How can she testify?

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.060
Your Highness,

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.550
my sister Yunshu

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.070
had eye trouble as a child,

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.510
which led her to develop

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.510
a sense of smell keener than a fox's.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.920
I identify tea mostly
with my eyes and hands,

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.780
but she relies solely on her nose.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.510
Yunshu, would you please smell

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.600
if there's something
unusual in this brazier?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.130
This silver-frost charcoal
is also known as white charcoal.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.680
Its enduring properties

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:53.550
conform to

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:55.200
the alchemist's pursuit of immortality,

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.200
which is why it's often used

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.130
to make elixirs.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.200
When Grandmother was ill,

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.680
doctors would use white charcoal

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.830
to line the bottom of the brazier,

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.830
place an iron mesh above
to steam medicinal pills,

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.360
enhancing their efficacy.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:06.170
I remember.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:07.880
Yunshu,

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:11.160
has anything been added to this charcoal?

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.130
It's Valley Lily mixed with honey,

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:15.060
made into pills.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.830
Valley Lily?

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.130
What effect does it have?

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:28.240
Valley Lily,
also called Convallariae Majalis.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.040
It can promote blood circulation
and dispel wind.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.720
When the charcoal burns,
the lily's fragrance emerges.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.130
Since its subtle scent is hidden,

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:36.400
often masked by charcoal smoke

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.750
and room incense,

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.620
it's not easily detected.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:40.960
Over time,

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.920
the occupant becomes prone to illness.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.030
Minor symptoms include irritability,

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.430
palpitations, anxiety,

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.450
and uncontrollable mood swings.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:49.580
In severe cases,

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.070
it can lead to heart failure and death.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:01.400
Your Highness,

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.680
this packet of pills has a faint scent,

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.720
each the size of a mung bean.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.720
They were found

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.270
in Miss Ji Ping's room.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:05.890
I don't-

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:07.600
Seize her!

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:11.690
Spit it out!

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.540
It's Valley Lily scented pills.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.240
Thank you. You may go rest now.

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.910
I'll wait for you in the library.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:38.400
Ji Ping,

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.290
Master Shuyu loved you so much.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.720
Why would you harm him?

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.490
Release her. Let her speak.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.480
Easy for you to say, Mrs. Xue.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:48.830
You're the principal wife

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:50.440
and the legitimate consort.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.170
And what am I?

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.880
I'm just a concubine,

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.550
and a lowly woman

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:55.810
from the opera troupe.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.070
When others say
Master Shuyu loves his concubine,

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.130
envy beyond words.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.590
But who knows

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:04.240
how dark and suffocating this mansion is,

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.040
not seeing my parents for years.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.680
Forget going to the peddler
at the back gate

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.740
to buy a flower or some makeup to wear—

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.270
I haven't even

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.800
stepped outside this door.

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.910
When Master Shuyu was happy,

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:17.710
he'd grant me a smile.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.790
When he returned
after being scolded by the Duke,

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.990
my body would be bruised for two months.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.510
In my next life,

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:26.680
I'd rather be a pig or dog
than a concubine.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.640
Yes, I am a lowly person,

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.260
but however humble, I am still human.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.450
He never treated me as a person,

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.580
so don't blame me for taking his life.

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:42.030
Who doesn't live

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:43.560
like this in a deep mansion?

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.690
Since ancient times,
those who kill must pay with their lives.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.490
And you killed your own husband.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.060
There's no way out for you.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:53.750
Mrs. Xue, there's no need for you

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.080
to waste your kindness.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.240
I'd

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.570
rather be dragged to the execution ground

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.510
than be suffocated

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.750
to death

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:03.750
under this mountain.

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:12.430
[Fuping Pavilion]

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.540
You wretch!

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.510
Plotting against your husband
is against heaven's law.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.240
You deserve to be flayed alive.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.240
I only fear if this becomes public,

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.370
it will ruin our family's reputation,

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.720
letting outsiders gossip and stir trouble,

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.920
tarnishing Father's lifelong good name.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.240
In my humble opinion,

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:39.880
this vile woman

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.620
shouldn't be openly
sent to the government.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.000
Better to handle this privately.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.860
Grant her a white silk rope

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.060
to end her own life.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.070
Take her away now!

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.880
Wait!

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:54.800
Jianglai,

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.480
you wanted to catch the murderer,

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.960
and I didn't go against your wishes.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.620
Now we've caught the culprit.

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:01.920
Your brother can finally rest in peace.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:02.960
What more do you want?

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.090
I haven't finished my interrogation!

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.550
I drank too much last night,

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.020
faintly hearing Princess Jinxiang

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.680
sending over a calming tonic.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:16.220
I wonder if Master Shuyu ever took it.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.980
Master Shuyu woke up
in the middle of the night,

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.400
complaining of a headache.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.180
In the past when Master Shuyu was drunk,

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:22.790
Princess often showed her concern

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.390
by sending sobering tonics,

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.930
and Master Shuyu
praised its effectiveness.

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:26.510
I just want to know

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.120
if he actually took it last night!

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.440
The calming tonic
was kept in the corridor,

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.790
warming on the charcoal stove.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:31.880
I poured half a cup.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.790
Master Shuyu drank it
and went back to sleep.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:36.250
The rest is in the tea room.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.680
Lu Jianglai,

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.550
we've already caught

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:40.630
the real murderer.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:43.480
Why are you still
asking all these questions?

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.240
Could it be that you suspect

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.830
I killed my own brother?

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.160
Even without Master Shuyu,

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:50.270
this title

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.220
couldn't possibly fall to me anyway.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.790
Are there any Valley Lily
in the mansion garden?

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:57.960
Or has anyone grown them
in their courtyard?

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.790
The garden only
has exotic flowers and plants.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.650
No one has ever grown Valley Lily.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.640
That's strange then.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.660
A sheltered woman from the opera troupe,

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.720
with little experience of the world,

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.960
who has never even stepped
beyond the courtyard gate—

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.170
who told her that Valley Lily is poisonous

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.370
and how to kill without leaving a trace?

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:15.960
And where did she obtain

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.690
the Valley Lily scented pills?

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:25.880
Ji Ping, who are you conspiring with?

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:28.680
If you don't
name the mastermind behind this,

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.940
the water dungeon in the Duke's Mansion
will show no mercy.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.640
Take her away and torture her severely!

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.400
No! I'm not going to the water dungeon!

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.520
I'm not going to the water dungeon!

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.350
Then tell me!

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.200
Please, Your Highness,

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.460
grant me a quick death.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.070
Let me die. Let me die!

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.000
I'm not going to the water dungeon!

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.040
I'm not going to the water dungeon!

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.290
I don't want to go to the water dungeon!

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:54.890
Your Highness, if you use severe torture,

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:56.820
she might make false confessions.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:58.200
We must also prevent her
from implicating the innocent

00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.460
and wronging the good.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.810
Ultimately, the result might fall short.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:03.880
No.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:05.800
Jianglai.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:07.420
Jun Dai.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.510
Yes.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:10.000
Go to the tea room

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.800
and bring the calming tonic.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.590
Test it, and we'll know.

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:15.750
Yes.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.720
You suspect

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.390
I conspired with a concubine?

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:22.790
Fine, test it then.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:24.950
I've done nothing wrong,

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.650
so there's nothing to fear.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.610
Young Madam.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.270
Mother!

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:32.920
What's wrong, Mother?

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:33.590
What's wrong with you?

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:34.350
Mother!

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:35.640
Wake up!

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:36.790
Wake up!

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.720
Mother, wake up!

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.550
Mother!

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.600
Has the culprit been caught?

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.320
His Highness has ordered

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.010
Ji Ping to be detained for now.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.310
What about the mastermind behind this?

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:11.070
Miss Ji Ping

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:12.790
grew up with the opera troupe,

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:14.270
traveling streets and alleys.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:15.590
She's seen many shady secrets

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:16.750
in noble households.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:19.350
It's no surprise
she knew Valley Lily is poisonous.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:21.380
Regardless of
where the Valley Lily came from,

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.310
we'll question everyone
in Fuping Pavilion,

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.770
and the truth will
eventually come to light.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:26.750
I doubt that.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.250
Why do you say so?

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.480
The Xue family has many secrets.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.640
That day when I entered the garden,

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.590
I happened to see Lady Xue Xuanyu

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:43.750
playing with someone.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:44.680
Guess who it was?

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:46.630
It was that aggressive woman

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.350
who strongly accused
Lord Lu of being the murderer,

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:49.480
Princess Jinxiang.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.270
Xue Yingchuan?

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.240
She's the children's aunt.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.110
What's wrong with her playing with Xuanyu?

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.830
That's exactly what's strange.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:00.430
When she saw a stranger then,

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.780
she immediately avoided being seen.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.480
Given how sharp-tongued and cutting

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.280
she was today,

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.000
how could she be

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.060
someone who's shy and avoids people?

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.650
Just now, I recognized her

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.840
and had my maid

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:12.800
get information
from the Xue family's servants.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.480
Guess what?

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.550
What secret

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.760
did you uncover?

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.880
The Xue family's maid said

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.030
this Princess Jinxiang

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:23.920
despises noisy children the most.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.850
Even her own niece is no exception.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.150
She usually avoids them,
keeping her distance,

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.150
and is quite cold.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.920
Something unusual
must have a hidden cause.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.960
Either her standing up
for her nephew and niece

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.219
has ulterior motives,

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:38.810
or she's hiding something

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:39.790
unspeakable.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.840
That makes sense.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.610
What about the person
I asked you to investigate?

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:50.580
You guessed correctly.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.580
She's indeed acting suspiciously.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:57.030
This is the calming tonic

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.650
that Princess Jinxiang sent last night.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:00.110
After Master Shuyu drank a cup,

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.670
there wasn't much left in the pot.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:02.920
I tested it on a rat.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.720
After taking this tonic,

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.880
the rat was still alive and kicking

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.940
half an hour later.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.010
If it had no effect on a small rat,

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.140
let alone on a human.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.030
It's clear that no poison

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.480
was added to this tonic.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.940
I'm not so sure about that.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.110
There are many ways

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:19.710
to harm people in this world.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.650
My Lord, I've found the person you wanted.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.590
Greetings, My Lord.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.280
It took great effort to bring him here.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.360
The Tao family has
practiced medicine for five generations,

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.840
with ancestors
who served as imperial physicians.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.320
When it comes to
expertise in pharmacology,

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.760
if Dr. Tao claims to be second best,

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.510
no one in the capital

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:39.070
would dare claim to be first.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.510
Dr. Tao, I entrust everything to you.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.230
My Lord, I'm flattered.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.070
On the way here,

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:44.760
Mr. Lang

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.630
has already explained
everything clearly to me.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:48.190
I will do my utmost

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.360
and dare not fail.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.890
[Fuping Pavilion]

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:03.590
Your Highness,

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.110
I have examined it.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.030
Speak.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:11.920
This calming tonic contains ginseng,

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:13.840
lotus seeds, ophiopogon,

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.440
poria, and angelica,

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:18.930
which nourish the heart
and relieve irritability.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.140
Due to Master Shuyu's leg injury,

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.670
tortoise shell and tiger tibia bone
were added

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.070
to strengthen his bones,

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.000
which is truly beneficial.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:29.320
Father,

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.710
you heard it yourself.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.880
This calming tonic contains

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.210
only beneficial herbs.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.670
I was nearly wrongfully accused

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:39.690
by this malicious person.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:41.230
Jianglai,

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.800
your sister-in-law
is overwhelmed with grief.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.760
Despite her illness,

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.360
she insists on hearing your judgment,

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.400
just to seek justice

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.400
for your brother.

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.790
Is this your solid evidence?

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:53.960
Dr. Tao hasn't finished speaking.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.230
Why are you so impatient?

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:57.400
Fine, continue.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.840
In the residue of the calming tonic,

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.360
there's also cinnamon, aconite,

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:04.450
and monkshood.

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.760
These are used to treat rheumatic pain

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.840
and relieve pain.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:11.110
What about cinnamon and aconite?

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.370
Ginseng, poria, and angelica

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:15.200
are indeed excellent herbs

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.480
for strengthening the body and blood.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.400
But with aconite and monkshood added

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.480
to dispel evil and wind,

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.110
it has

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.710
the effect of Great Reviving Pill.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.800
I questioned his personal servant.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.400
Due to Master Shuyu's back and leg pain,

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.320
when encountering
rainy or changing weather,

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.280
he often had stiff limbs at night,

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:35.000
difficulty bending and stretching,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.320
and the joints of his sick leg
were deformed.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.580
Dr. Liu from the palace

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.070
left a good prescription.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.630
I've seen the prescription.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:43.360
It's the Gastrodia Pill

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.330
for relieving pain
and benefiting the liver.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.030
Taking one dose daily of Gastrodia Pill

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:51.280
is appropriate treatment.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.440
The Great Reviving Pill

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.760
also won't kill anyone on its own.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.760
But taking the two together is different.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.960
Especially aconite,
which is hot-natured and toxic.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.000
Once overdosed,

00:37:59.070 --> 00:37:59.960
even beneficial medicine

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.420
can become deadly poison.

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.000
You knew Master Shuyu

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.230
was taking the Gastrodia Pill

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:05.630
and should have avoided
any contraindications,

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.510
yet you deliberately
sent this calming tonic

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:08.970
with hidden intricacies.

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:11.380
What were your intentions?

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.970
You're slandering me!

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:16.150
Even Dr. Liu couldn't see any problem.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.960
How would I know

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.760
if they could be taken together?

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.290
Besides, this is just your speculation.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.760
Whether taking both could kill someone

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.710
is still uncertain.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:27.550
Very well.
If you're so certain it's harmless,

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:28.880
why not try it yourself?

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:30.400
Take the Gastrodia Pill

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.800
and the Great Reviving Pill

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.460
together in increased doses.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.020
If you remain perfectly safe,

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.590
I'll leave the Duke's Mansion immediately

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:39.880
and never return.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.110
Yingchuan,

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.700
what do you have to say?

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:51.550
Why won't you take it?

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.440
This is your perfect opportunity

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.840
to prove your innocence.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:05.360
Father,

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.760
since Mother has been ill
and depressed for a long time,

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.790
unable to sleep at night,

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:11.630
I specially invited an imperial physician

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.400
to prescribe calming tonic for her,

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.930
and it worked wonderfully.

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.360
I was simply sharing the benefit,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.860
concerned about Shuyu's health,

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:23.630
with absolutely no ill intentions.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:25.960
As a daughter,

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:27.590
I can neither uphold the household

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:29.070
nor inherit any titles.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.190
Shuyu and I grew up together

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.600
with deep affection.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.960
How could I possibly intend to harm him,

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.680
only to let an outsider gain advantage?

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.110
The saying that I would harm my brother

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.440
makes no sense emotionally or logically.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:49.490
Your Highness,

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:52.000
Mother has long suffered from diabetes,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.360
often complaining of
numbness in her limbs,

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.710
and has difficulty walking.

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:56.070
I went back to beg my grandfather

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:57.840
to prepare a prescription for her.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.670
He said it's the best for
treating numbness in the limbs.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.150
The Xie family's medical skills
are passed only to sons, not daughters.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:05.070
I don't understand pharmacology.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.150
Mother said she felt better
after taking it,

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.280
so she kept taking this prescription.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.760
It's all my fault.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.230
I should have been more cautious,

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:16.190
understood
the contraindications of the medicine,

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.920
so this later misfortune

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.320
wouldn't have occurred.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.070
Father,

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.280
I swear.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:23.390
This medicine

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.670
indeed came from

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:25.960
Mother's quarters.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.450
I truly didn't know.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.060
I've been wronged.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:29.800
I've been wronged!

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.670
You must believe me!

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:32.530
You may not know the inside story,

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.840
but others might have ill intentions.

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.360
Bring Madam Chang here.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:40.510
Go!

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.590
Yes.

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:46.550
The Xie family's daughter
is graceful and magnanimous,

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:47.950
renowned for her virtue,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.960
which is well-known in the capital.

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.400
I believe in you.

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:53.660
Help her up.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:10.880
Although a major incident
has occurred in the mansion,

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.590
Madam's health is not well.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.000
She's only had half a bowl
of rice congee in two days.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:16.930
Her legs and feet

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.440
are too swollen for her to walk.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.640
What matter must be inquired about now?

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.440
It's most inhumane.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:26.610
Set down the sedan.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:31.030
Gently, all of you.

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:33.880
-Madam.
-Madam.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:34.880
You're still ill.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.690
His Highness won't blame you.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.670
-Just let them...
-Help me get off the sedan.

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:39.280
Madam.

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.880
Let go.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.410
-Madam.
-Let go.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.840
-Madam!
-Madam!

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.000
Let go.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:37.630
What?

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.180
A joint interrogation

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:41.710
has come upon me?

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.290
Shuyu was not your biological son,

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.020
and you've always been distant with him.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.930
But I thought
that coming from a noble family,

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.640
though not agreeable in temperament,

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.280
you would raise the children

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.000
and manage the household

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.660
with diligence and fairness.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:01.640
I never expected

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.970
your poisonous intentions
were hidden here.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.110
Knowing full well that Shuyu

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:08.040
was the heir of the Duke's Mansion,

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:10.410
you instigated Yingchuan to poison him.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:12.070
How malevolent.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.630
You've not only disgraced
the Xue family's honor,

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:16.880
but also brought shame upon

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.140
your own Chang family.

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:20.470
Even death by a thousand cuts
would be too merciful.

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:21.330
Your Highness,

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:22.590
Madam Chang used the medicine

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:23.970
only to treat her own illness.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.060
You readily believe
Xue Yingchuan's inciting words

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.920
and lightly conclude her guilty.

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:29.700
Is the Great Reviving Pill

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.670
only available in Madam Chang's quarters?

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.800
Couldn't Xue Yingchuan get it elsewhere?

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.440
Madam Chang has no sons of her own

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.360
and no grudges.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.020
Why would she scheme to harm Master Shuyu?

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.140
No grudges?

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:43.070
Of course she has grievances,

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.650
but they shouldn't be directed at Shuyu.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.010
They should rightly be aimed at me.

00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:57.700
Your Highness,

00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:59.400
Mother has always been fair

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.510
and strict in managing the household.

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:01.360
She treats herself

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.480
more harshly than she treats juniors

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.320
and servants.

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:05.360
That's why this household is so orderly

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.670
with proper respect for hierarchy.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:07.510
While you were at the front

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:08.510
fighting in the war,

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:10.510
Mother has been
managing everything at home.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:11.710
I don't believe Mother

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.260
would ever plot to harm anyone.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.720
Please investigate this matter carefully.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.680
Mother wouldn't harm Master Shuyu,

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.880
but I would?

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:21.280
She has been neglected for years,

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.540
so it's natural she harbors resentment.

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:24.800
In a moment of poor judgment,

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.350
she made a terrible mistake.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:28.140
Yet you keep defending her.

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:29.550
Are you trying to shift

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:30.920
the blame onto me?

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.720
Father, I've been wronged.

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:43.120
It was me.

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:45.920
I killed Xue Shuyu.

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:30.070
[Brewing Tea, Tasting Tea]

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.320
No matter where the Valley Lily came from,

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.320
we'll question
everyone in Fuping Pavilion.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.580
The truth will eventually come to light.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:37.700
I doubt it.

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.290
Why do you say so?

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.000
China has a vast variety of teas,

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:46.060
with various ways to appreciate them.

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:47.150
In our drama, the Rong family

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:49.010
mainly cultivates Longjing tea.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.150
To drink Longjing properly,

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:52.030
you need the right method

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:54.030
to taste its fresh, vibrant flavor.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.030
First, warm and moisten the cup.

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:57.900
[Warming the Cup]

00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:01.280
Pinch some tea leaves
and place them at the bottom of the cup.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.050
Let boiled water sit for three minutes,

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:04.900
allowing it reaches about 80 ℃.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:06.770
Add a little water to the bottom,

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:08.540
just enough to cover the tea leaves.

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:10.870
Hold the cup and swirl it

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:12.350
counterclockwise twice.

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.230
This step is called
"moistening the tea to release aroma."

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.820
[Moistening Tea to Release Aroma]

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:16.360
Then using

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.920
the "Phoenix Nods Three Times" method,

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.920
pour water until the cup is 70% full.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.230
Watch the tea leaves float and sink,

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:22.550
releasing the tea fragrance.

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:24.230
After waiting two to three minutes,

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:25.560
the tea soup will gradually turn

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.710
a bright yellowish-green color.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:27.480
This is the perfect

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.070
temperature and taste for appreciation.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:29.210
We can savor it in three stages.

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:31.360
[First Sip, Second Sip, Third Sip]

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.110
The first stage

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:34.360
is to appreciate its rich, fresh aroma.

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.590
When half the tea soup remains,

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:37.650
refill with water.

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:42.670
The second stage
reveals the tea's true flavor—

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:44.110
fresh, mellow and full,

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.150
leaving a lingering fragrance
with each sip.

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.880
When the cup

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.400
has one-third of tea soup left,

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.230
refill with water.

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:50.590
The third stage brings

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:51.920
a mouth-watering sweet aftertaste.

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.110
The aroma is subtle yet long-lasting.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.280
After finishing the last round,

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.440
remember to pour out the tea leaves

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.710
into a basin of clear water.

00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:59.230
You can admire how the spent leaves

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:00.400
still bloom beautifully.
