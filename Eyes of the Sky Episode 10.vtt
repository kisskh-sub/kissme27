WEBVTT

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.079
What's going on?

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.880
Isn't Xiao Yun in the car?

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.200
Where is Mind-Bender?

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.079
She is Mind-Bender.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.719
Xiao Yun, are you okay?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.480
Why am I here?

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.480
Did you catch Mind-Bender?

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.239
Lin Yun, stop pretending.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.599
Shut up.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.480
Xiao Yun.

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:34.599
Think carefully about what happened.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.280
I...

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.079
I rode Huo Ming's delivery bike as planned.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.680
But as soon as I got on,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.359
I ended up here.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.239
And I don't remember anything else.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.079
Lin Yun.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.040
Are you acting?

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.519
You were just wearing this helmet,

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.680
forcing me to reveal The Firmament's password.

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:03.319
Why is it you?

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.719
If there's a problem with the helmet,

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.840
then he was coming for you.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.000
Xiao Yun took the hit for you.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.080
That's not necessarily true.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.400
Maybe it's a self-injury ruse.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.000
Master.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.479
The helmet has two neural interface patches on the side.

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.120
It can control brain signals.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.240
Whoever wears it becomes Mind-Bender.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.280
And the real Mind-Bender

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.680
is controlling it remotely.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.919
Master, you wrongly accused Lin Yun.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.879
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:54.840
Hurry and think of a solution.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.879
Actually, we were all wrong.

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.000
We've been looking for the person under the helmet.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.240
But who is under the helmet doesn't actually matter.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.000
What exactly do you mean?

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.039
What I'm trying to say is...

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.879
whoever puts on the helmet...

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:22.800
becomes Mind-Bender.

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:27.080
If I put it on, I'm him.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.879
If you put it on, you're him.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.159
Stay away from Xiao Yun from now on.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.080
Let's go.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:35.360
Lin Yun, let me explain.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.039
Huo Ming.

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.280
It's not safe here right now either.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.919
You'd better find a place to hide, quick.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.879
Hide...

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.000
In other words...

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.439
all the Mind-Benders we've seen before...

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.639
were just puppets.

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.919
The real mastermind is still in the shadows.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.240
I will help you.

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:03.639
Don't worry.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.080
Come here.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.319
I didn't come here to argue.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.560
Look at this.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.080
I didn't expect you to discover my secret.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.079
Fortunately, I caught her.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.680
You joined forces to trick me.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.879
So naturally, there must be punishment.

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:24.920
In one hour, the oxygen will run out.

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.319
When she is in a near-death state...

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.720
and her will to survive is strongest...

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.240
I will extract her memories.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.839
I want you to remember...

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.279
this is the price of deceiving me.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.399
It's my fault.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.839
I should have...

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.079
You knew it was dangerous.

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.439
Why didn't you take her away?

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.199
What does it have to do with you?

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.319
Don't panic, we still have time.

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:46.920
I've examined this helmet.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.240
We can activate it.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.439
You mean...

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.839
reverse trace the signal source?

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.720
Exactly.

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:53.879
But given this helmet's technology...

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:56.160
it can only last for a dozen seconds after repair.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.079
With me here, that's enough.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.639
No offense, Huo Ming.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.800
but we need the best decryption expert.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.959
Professor Mark.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:09.800
He was my computer science mentor abroad.

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:11.639
An internationally renowned computer expert.

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:13.199
He once assisted Interpol...

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.639
in tracking down several top criminals across borders.

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.720
Chu, let me correct you.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.240
It wasn't just across borders.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.040
It was a trans-Atlantic pursuit over thousands of miles.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.519
Then I'll ask Mr. Mark to assist Huo Ming...

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:25.879
to reverse trace the signal source.

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:27.879
Hello, Mr. Mark.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.079
Who is he?

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.279
A delivery guy.

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:34.439
How could a delivery guy possibly solve...

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:36.199
such a difficult technical problem?

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.160
Delivery guys should just obediently stay at their stations.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.800
Then why don't we have a competition?

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.319
To see who traces it first.

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:45.199
You're on.

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:47.399
Since you're looking for a chance to be humiliated...

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:48.639
I'll give you that chance.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.920
Once the helmet is activated...

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.279
there's only thirty seconds at most.

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:54.680
If we don't find it, there won't be another chance.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.639
Are you ready?

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:02.639
Activate.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.399
Watch and learn, kid.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.160
The neural signal encryption is too complex.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.480
But this won't stop me.

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:30.560
Time is almost up

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.000
Please hurry up

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:37.519
Five

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.480
Four

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.480
Three

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:40.480
Two

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:41.519
One

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.240
The signal source is right here

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:52.319
Mr. Mark

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.199
This signal source is incorrect

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:56.399
Do you know how many bits of encryption

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:58.240
are needed to track a quantum signal?

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.839
Do you know how to find the real point

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:02.240
among 36,000 virtual nodes?

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.759
Do you know how to bypass

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:05.720
and trace back fake IP addresses?

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:07.279
If you don't, then shut up

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.240
Mr. Mark

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.800
This signal receiver

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.800
has a maximum range of only five kilometers

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.680
You are currently exceeding that distance

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.279
Amateur

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.759
That is just the theoretical distance

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:19.160
In practice, six kilometers is absolutely fine

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.279
This IP address

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:21.480
is hidden

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.639
There is no need to operate at the limit

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.240
Based on where Mind-Bender is active

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.600
I deduce

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:31.600
he is right here now

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.879
Idiot

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.439
That is a fake node

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.480
Dare to make a bet with me?

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.879
Loser kneels and calls me Grandpa

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:42.600
You're on

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.279
Then let's hurry up

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.879
Follow me, it's right here

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.639
Mind-Bender's base is right behind this wall

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.399
We go in and catch him

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:56.759
Pop the champagne

00:07:58.279 --> 00:07:59.360
Why don't you come take a look?

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.439
The smell is too strong

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.639
Not suitable for popping champagne

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:02.399
Impossible

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.079
Less than a minute left

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:13.279
Still time, follow me

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.399
Let's go

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.919
All nodes are avoiding this area

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.559
There is a hidden IP address here

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.480
It's in Room 9

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:55.039
Who are you looking for?

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:04.960
Excuse me

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.639
Your friend isn't on time

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:13.120
Looks like there's no way

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.639
You lost too

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:23.080
Impossible

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.480
My deduction shouldn't be wrong

00:09:24.519 --> 00:09:25.080
Master

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.440
This isn't Number 9

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.440
The door number is upside down

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.279
It's Number 6

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.399
Over there

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:38.720
Fu Xue

00:09:41.799 --> 00:09:43.240
Mind-Bender got away again

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.679
Fu Xue

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.639
Master, save her quickly

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.639
Master, quick, CPR

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:08.320
Huo Ming

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.519
Huo Ming

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:16.879
Come, sit down first.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.559
It's okay, it's okay.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.080
I just...

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.879
Men, after all,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.200
never let an opportunity slip by.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.120
Right, Huo Ming?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.679
I lost.

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:40.080
I accept my defeat.

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:41.679
No need.

00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:44.879
If you were really my grandson,

00:10:45.159 --> 00:10:46.159
my mom wouldn't agree to it.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.519
Huo Ming is very capable.

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:57.120
Professor Mark was too arrogant.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.480
It was my poor judgment.

00:10:59.039 --> 00:10:59.960
Facts have proven...

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.679
that you have a better eye.

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:02.919
Everyone you choose

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:05.519
brings unexpected value to the team.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.360
Are you praising yourself?

00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:10.799
After all, I chose you back then.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.960
I always remember our agreement.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.600
You never bound me with vows,

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.279
yet you've firmly tied my heart.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.759
How is it? Nice place, right?

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.000
President Lin and President Chu are on a date here.

00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:42.720
President Bai, why are you here?

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.440
If you two can come,

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:46.960
why can't I come with Huo Ming?

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.960
Coming to a place like this,

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.320
one should pay attention to attire.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.919
What's wrong with this? It's so handsome.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.320
Huo Ming looks handsome in anything.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.480
President Bai really has a genuine nature.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.080
Because I've seen too many people who are well-dressed on the surface,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.039
but are actually filthy and ugly on the inside.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.600
But Huo Ming isn't.

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:12.559
I heard Huo Ming is very impressive.

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:15.080
He even beat a foreign professor named Mark.

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:16.799
President Chu just lost,

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:19.000
so don't provoke him to his face.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.639
Mr. Huo,

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.799
we can compete again.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.759
For example,

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:29.320
billiards.

00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:31.200
Chu Chen,

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:33.159
I know you are world-class.

00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:35.200
A master level in snooker ranking tournaments.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.159
A while ago,

00:12:36.159 --> 00:12:38.279
you even tied with the World Champion.

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:39.720
Now you want to compete in pool with him?

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.360
You...

00:12:40.919 --> 00:12:42.480
aren't you being too scheming?

00:12:42.559 --> 00:12:43.360
Fine.

00:12:48.039 --> 00:12:49.519
I thought you didn't know how to play pool?

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:50.600
I don't play,

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.159
doesn't mean I can't play.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:01.320
Bullying a novice isn't interesting.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.399
How about this?

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.519
I can use a cue without a tip,

00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:06.879
and coat the tip with turpentine to increase the difficulty.

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:07.720
No need.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.480
If we compete, let's do it fairly.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.960
If you lose too badly later,

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:12.320
don't blame me.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.080
Friend, playing pool is done with hands,

00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:16.080
not with the mouth.

00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:40.200
This skill is too handsome!

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.320
Simply a hundred percent accuracy.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.840
Truly master level.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.279
This technique is absolutely incredible.

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:47.960
A slight deviation in angle or force, and it won't go in.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.480
Lin Yun and I,

00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:54.200
are like the cue and cue ball in my hand, in perfect sync.

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:56.399
Years of honing, familiar with each other.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.799
Every collision is a precise success.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.159
But you,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.320
are just a ball thrown in at the last minute.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.279
You have no chemistry with her at all.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.720
Even if you force your way onto the table,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.879
you will only disrupt the rhythm.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.919
You make playing pool sound so philosophical,

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:23.080
and even summarize the meaning of life from it.

00:14:23.159 --> 00:14:25.559
Clearing the table from the break is an empty victory.

00:14:25.879 --> 00:14:26.679
How about this?

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:28.279
As long as you can use a normal cue

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:29.559
to sink half the balls,

00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:30.840
I'll count it as your win.

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:38.279
Good or bad skills, we'll know once we play.

00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:39.720
Matters of the heart,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.519
aren't decided by your mouth either.

00:14:41.759 --> 00:14:43.039
Since I agreed to compete with you,

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.519
I definitely won't let you win.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.240
Hello.

00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:53.480
Please get me a cigar.

00:15:09.399 --> 00:15:11.720
Xiao Cang, full power.
