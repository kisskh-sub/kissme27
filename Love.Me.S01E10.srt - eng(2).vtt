00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.310
(Seo Hyun Jin)

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.750
(Yoo Jae Myung)

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.850
(Lee Si Woo)

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.030
(Yoon Se A)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.440
(Chang Ryul)

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.180
(Dahyun)

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.920
(Love Me)

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:01.030
(Love Me)

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
All right, let's try that again.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.680
Let's keep that and go for one more take.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.690
Let's do it one more time.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.430
We'll keep that and go again.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.430
We'll keep this one too.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.300
Gyu Hee.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.870
Gyu Hee.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.840
Gyu Hee.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.480
- I can't do this. - Gosh, what's wrong?

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.920
Of all days for Na Ra to get sick, it had to be today.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.490
And you had to go and make the song so difficult.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.560
Where do we find someone to pull this off on short notice?

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.630
What about Hui Jeong?

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.200
Hui Jeong? You think I didn't already call her?

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.900
She saw the score and said she'd need a week to practice.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.470
I'm not trying to blame you, but you could've been more flexible.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.880
This is definitely...

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.880
Yoon Ju?

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.850
You really did just fall out of the sky.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.780
I heard you were back in town,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.420
but I can't believe you're actually here.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.090
Hi, Do Hyun.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.400
Hey, Jun Kyung, have you eaten yet?

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.130
I was waiting to eat with you, so not yet.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.470
Are you going to be much longer?

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.940
It's going to take a little longer.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.770
I'll probably grab a bite with Jung Hoon later,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.440
so go ahead and eat without me.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.980
You must be starving.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.490
Jin Ho.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.860
Have you seen my Bom?

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.830
It's just that I can't find Bom.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.270
Ja Yeong.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.470
Are you okay?

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.870
I must have dozed off.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.810
I was dreaming about Bom.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.080
The dream felt so real, I thought she was actually here.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.290
Goodness.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.820
So it was a dream.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.430
I must have scared you.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.890
Gosh.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.730
I'm sorry.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.200
Oh, and one more thing. You'll need about 5,000 dollars ready.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.670
A lot of people are competing to teach these electives,

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.010
and it's a desirable position, so that amount isn't out of line.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.820
All right. Wrap things up and come quick.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.630
The director loved it.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.740
- Send Jung Hoon your account info. - Gosh, so transactional.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.340
Thank you.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.050
- Enjoy your meal. - We will, thank you.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.280
It's been ages since I've had hagfish.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.490
Playing earlier brought back so many memories.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.160
Remember that street piano in Jongno from our freshman year?

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.160
I played your piece on it back then, remember?

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.370
A huge crowd gathered around us. Remember that?

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.740
Do you have any idea how much I liked you back then?

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.720
Come on, we don't need to be awkward about old memories.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.660
I was thinking about the old days earlier too.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:54.890
Back then,

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.230
I really liked you too.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.700
But...

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.770
like you said,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.970
it's all in the past.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.490
I'm sorry, but I should get going.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.330
Jun Kyung is waiting for me. I don't feel right staying longer.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.640
Then what about me?

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.470
You're the one I need right now.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.330
We were over a long time ago.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.870
I'll do my best as Daniel's father,

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.170
but there's nothing more between us.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.370
Do Hyun, where are you going? Hey!

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.010
Do Hyun!

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.610
(Grilled hagfish, eel noodles, pork rind)

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.060
I know.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.760
I know Jun Kyung is with Do Hyun now.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.300
But it's only been two years.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.440
We go way back.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.610
And we have...

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.710
Daniel.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.450
I just figured I had the upper hand.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.950
Come on, it's not a competition.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.330
So,

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.060
what are you going to do now?

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:49.930
I don't know.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.100
What am I supposed to do now?

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.710
Both joy and sorrow...

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.620
always seem to come out of nowhere.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.690
This feels especially true for sorrow.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.700
There's a certain tribe in Africa...

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.570
that believed that rain was a sign of the Almighty's sorrow.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.370
When it rained, they wouldn't leave their village...

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.270
until the rain stopped.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.480
Not until the sun was shining and the ground was dry.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:41.190
Here in Seoul, unforeseen rain is falling.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.060
Could it be a sign of sorrow...

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.260
that the Almighty is sending us?

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.330
Listeners,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.760
did you remember your umbrellas?

00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.900
With Bom...

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.210
She'd stay still when I'd pet her like this.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.780
I can still feel how soft the back of her head was.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.320
The happy memories...

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.950
are what make things harder.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.990
If I'd known it would be this hard,

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.130
I wouldn't have tried to be so happy.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.630
I wonder if that Oblivion Package is still a thing.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.610
Remember the tourists on Jeju, when we were eating?

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.110
- Jin Ho. - Yes?

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.950
Do you hear that?

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.590
The rain?

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.090
Jun Kyung, where have you been?

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.390
You're soaked. You should have taken an umbrella.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.590
It's like an umbrella can be right by your side,

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.560
but it's never there when you actually need it.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.340
I lied to you, Jun Kyung.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:52.450
Earlier,

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.220
when you called me,

00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.590
I was with Yoon Ju.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.130
I was worried you'd be uncomfortable if you knew,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.600
so I couldn't tell you.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.970
I thought it was better to lie.

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.020
I'm sorry.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.920
I went by the studio earlier.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.670
Thank you for being honest with me.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.500
I've been giving this a lot of thought,

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.100
and...

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.470
I hope that moment is now.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.950
When you need me,

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.880
and even when you don't,

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:36.590
I...

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.060
will always be by your side, Jun Kyung.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:56.170
Jun Kyung.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.680
Will you marry me?

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.750
- Hi, Dad. - Hey, Jun Kyung.

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.620
- Is now a bad time? - No, it's fine. What's up?

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.820
It's not a big deal,

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.920
but it's about Ja Yeong.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.990
I thought she was doing better here,

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.560
but lately, she's been having trouble sleeping,

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.400
she seems much more on edge,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.730
and she just seems depressed.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.230
I've heard of something called Pet Loss Syndrome.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.500
Maybe that's what she's going through?

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.270
Pet Loss Syndrome?

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.840
Yes. It's after you lose a pet.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.440
I heard a lot of people even go to therapy for it.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.020
They were family, after all.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.720
Jun Kyung. Why don't you all come visit sometime?

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.960
I haven't seen you all in a while, and I miss Daniel too.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.660
We will, Dad.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:27.830
I'm sorry for not checking in.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.330
I know you're busy. Thanks.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.300
- Okay. - Jun Kyung.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.270
And you're doing okay, right?

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.480
I'm doing fine.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.050
All right, I'll see you soon, Jun Kyung.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:45.850
Okay.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.060
Ja Yeong.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.630
What are you looking at so intently?

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.210
The five-day market should be open. Want to go check it out?

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.180
We can pick up a few things we need,

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.110
and grab some jjajangmyeon while we're there.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:19.150
Jin Ho.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.750
Yes?

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.920
Do you think...

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.790
we rushed into moving here?

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.460
I wonder if running away like that was the right decision.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:37.630
Jin Ho.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:39.900
Jin Ho?

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.410
You don't like it here?

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.680
- What? - Answer me. Don't you like it here?

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.780
- It's not that... - You were the one who said it.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:50.810
You wanted to see the first flowers bloom,

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.380
get the first kiss of the sun,

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.150
step on the first fallen leaves. You'd like a place like this.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.520
You're the one who told me that, Ja Yeong.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.060
What do you mean, "running away"? We're not running from anything.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.900
I was just feeling a bit suffocated, and...

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:07.730
I didn't really mean anything by it.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.870
I'm sorry.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.600
I guess I was being a little sensitive.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:28.520
You're living with Jun Kyung, right?

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:33.290
Which means you're basically in a common-law marriage already.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:37.830
All you have to do is take just one more step.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.800
Just one more step.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.270
But for Jun Kyung, that one step is the hard part.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:46.740
I know.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.540
It's because...

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.680
my job isn't stable, and...

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.410
- I have a kid too. - If there's even a one percent...

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.020
of ulterior motive in his proposal,

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.720
it'd just feel wrong.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:03.920
It's not because of her.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.790
And it's not because of the kid.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.660
If it's not because of his ex,

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.230
then what on earth is it?

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.730
I'm telling you, it's not about you.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:20.070
For Jun Kyung, the issue is with marriage itself.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.510
It's... How should I put this?

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.040
She's already gone through countless mental rehearsals...

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.410
and run pointless simulations in her head.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.320
It's typical for smart pessimists who think they know it all.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.520
The point is, whether it's you or someone else,

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.660
it's not a problem with her partner. You get me?

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:40.990
What I mean is, for Jun Kyung, it's about herself.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:46.100
This compulsion to never, ever fail? This perfectionism?

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.430
That's what's kicking in.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.530
I'm the problem.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.240
You don't get it, do you?

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.540
No.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.350
I really don't get it,

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.350
and I can't relate at all.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.320
Do Hyun is a really great guy.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:14.260
He's the one who made me realise that joy and happiness...

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.760
all come from our relationships with others.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.360
Then why?

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.200
I don't have the confidence.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.340
It's already overwhelming dealing with what I expect.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.280
If something unexpected happens between us,

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.110
a tragedy that's completely out of our control,

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.990
I'm sure I'd want to run away and let it all go.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.990
Right.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.160
Your dad had it...

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.160
really tough.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.270
No.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.240
It's because I imagine how hard it was for my mom.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.440
She couldn't hold on, but she couldn't let go either.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.680
She must have been in so much agony.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.110
- How's it going? - It's a total train wreck.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.180
And Jun Kyung?

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:41.650
She's being sincere.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.010
Sincere enough to turn down a diamond.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.580
I've never seen Do Hyun look so serious.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.020
Don't tell me...

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.420
They're not going to break up, are they?

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.890
A couple in their prime fails to take the next step?

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.230
- The chances are high. - No way, they're so in love.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:06.340
The culmination of love is marriage. It's the destiny of a social animal.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.740
Love and marriage are inseparable. They're a package deal.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.210
If you realise there's no future with someone,

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.980
it's instinct to go out and find someone who is.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:17.910
Are you very disappointed?

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.720
No.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.460
A little.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.660
I'm disappointed.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.660
I'm sorry.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.550
Your own...

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.050
special moment,

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.380
will come. I truly believe that it will.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.030
I'll be waiting eagerly. I really will.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.950
Thank you for understanding.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.170
Gosh, this is all rotted out.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.040
Oh, you scared me! You really startled me.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:57.250
Are you sure you can handle that?

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.620
You've never done this before. Shouldn't you call a professional?

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:03.990
What? It's my own house. I can't always call for help.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.060
I've got to do it myself.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.329
- Need a hand? - No, it's fine.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.090
It's dangerous. Go on, get down.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.700
It's dangerous. Get down.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:17.300
Are you still sulking?

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.070
Sulking? Who's sulking?

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.640
Just get down already.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:25.880
All right.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.380
What does she take me for? Watch me fix this perfectly.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.990
Okay. A little thing like this?

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:38.190
Okay, here we go.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:39.960
Goodness, this thing is loud.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.090
See? Nothing to it.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.329
- Oh, no! - Jin Ho!

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.970
Ja Yeong, help me! I've been shot!

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:52.340
What am I going to do about this?

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.010
- Look at this! What do we do? - What do we do?

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.840
No, don't! It's dangerous! Get back!

00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:59.910
- Oh, no! - Just do something about this!

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.380
- Like what? - Don't pull it!

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:07.150
(Bom Campground)

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.349
- Hey, you brat! You little... - Come here.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:11.390
My goodness.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.660
Did you just laugh?

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.200
I'm sorry, Jin Ho.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.540
It's just, you look so ridiculous right now...

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.640
- What? - I can't believe this!

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:31.610
Goodness.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.480
- Cheers. - Cheers.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.320
Feels good to be done, right? You worked hard.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.220
Hey, I told you I'd treat you to something even better.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.060
Whenever I was up writing late at night,

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:51.190
I'd get a huge craving for a thick, loaded seafood pancake like this.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.630
I told myself I'd get one tomorrow, but then I'd forget,

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.300
and then the craving would hit again in the middle of the night.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.040
You seem to be in a really good mood.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.540
- Looks like you have good news. - Gosh, is it that obvious?

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.080
Okay, let me brag for a second.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.450
My boyfriend isn't a professor,

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.350
but it looks like he's going to be teaching at the university.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.420
So it's a double celebration!

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.090
I just assumed you'd heard the news too.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.520
Heard what?

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:33.170
I've printed the sophomore materials and am now organising the juniors'.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.300
Thanks.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.240
Oh, right.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.110
I heard from Professor Choi.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.680
- Congratulations. - It's all thanks to you, Professor.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.380
Thank you.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.820
The semester's almost over,

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.350
so finish strong.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.820
- Yes, sir. - Okay. Finish up and then head out.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.689
If you need anything while prepping for lectures,

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.230
or if you have any questions or run into trouble,

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.560
don't hesitate to let me know.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.100
Professor?

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:06.370
Yes? What's up?

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:09.170
Well...

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.980
If you have something, spit it out. I have to get to class.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:16.180
It's nothing. I'll do my best to finish strong.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.220
- All right! - All right!

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.960
Hey, you have a minute? I wanted to ask you something.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.700
Yes, go ahead.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.200
This is kind of random, but...

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:41.400
Nowadays, do lecturers still have to give their supervising professor...

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.740
money or something?

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:46.880
Who even does that anymore?

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:48.710
Why?

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:50.780
Don't tell me... Professor Song?

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.350
No. Someone just asked me about it.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.150
Okay, thanks. I'll talk to you later.

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:58.050
Bye.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
What?

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.540
You're here?

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:18.939
- Jun Seo, wake up. - Why?

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.040
- Get up. Give me your hand. - Why?

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.050
Goodness. Gosh.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.550
- What is it? - Our big-mouthed writer said...

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.320
- Yes? - I...

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.990
won the Grand Prize!

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:38.290
Really?

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.270
In the Woori-deul Publishing Contest,

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.840
I won the Grand Prize!

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.670
- Hey, good job. - Oh, my! I can't believe it!

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.210
- All your hard work paid off. - I'm so happy!

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.720
- You packed a toothbrush and towel? - Yes, I got everything.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.520
You've wanted to go camping, Daniel, so this is perfect.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:10.060
Yes. And Jun Seo and Hye On are so much fun.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.870
Mom, what are you going to do?

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.800
While I'm gone?

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.270
I have plenty to do.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.310
- I'll see my friends and have fun. - Mom.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.340
You should still...

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:29.410
feed Oscar.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:32.150
Don't forget.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.720
Hey, do you really think I'd forget to feed Oscar?

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.720
No, that's not it.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:40.160
It's just that I once didn't feed him on purpose.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:44.660
Because of Ms. Seo.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.260
I was so mad at her.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.800
I think Dad's here.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.210
- Mom, I'm heading out. - Okay, have fun.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:06.420
Gosh, you're washing my face and even my hair.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.550
I'm really getting the royal treatment.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:10.750
Getting hurt was totally worth it.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.690
Maybe I'll injure my right hand. Then you'd have to feed me, right?

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:21.700
Would you please be quiet? Everyone will be here any minute.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:24.130
Here comes the water.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:26.340
Oh, so refreshing.

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:30.140
(Bom Campground)

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:35.810
- Dad. - Hey, glad you made it.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.950
- Hello. - Hi, welcome.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.280
- It's good to see you. - Hello. Hey, Dad.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.520
- Gosh, look how tall you've gotten! - She's so pretty.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:46.690
I got taller, didn't I?

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.260
Hey!

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.390
Get it! Come on!

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.930
- Did you get it? - Jun Kyung! Look at this!

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:57.330
I can't believe this.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:59.670
There are so many fish, but I can't seem to catch any.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.110
Come on, how could you miss that? Seriously, how did you not catch it?

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:05.410
It's cold.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.610
What's the problem?

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.520
Do Hyun...

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:20.660
The more I see of him, the more I like him.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:24.990
You think so too, Mom?

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:29.830
I do. You two look wonderful together.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:38.370
Why are you hesitating?

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:43.550
Jun Kyung.

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:48.920
My life wasn't just a series of hardships.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.620
You may not understand it right now,

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.390
and that can be scary,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.730
but as you go through life, you'll understand.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.870
That love isn't just about the joy...

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.910
and happiness of being together.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:17.680
When you look at someone and your heart just aches,

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.590
and you feel for them,

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:26.660
that's also a part of love.

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.730
For me, all of it was happiness,

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:37.230
and I was grateful for every moment.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.310
The part of me that wanted to let go...

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:53.080
and wanted to run away...

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.220
I'm so sorry that you saw that side of me.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:06.830
Jun Kyung.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:08.900
Don't be afraid.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:12.340
You, Jun Kyung,

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.270
are so much stronger than I ever was.

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:30.320
Yes, I got one!

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.820
There are so many!

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.360
Jun Kyung!

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:38.090
- Look at this! Fish! - Look at this!

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.160
There are a ton!

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.800
Hey, awesome, right?

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.940
All right, everyone.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:53.310
- That's way too much. What do I do? - Bottoms up!

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.540
- You guys! - No way!

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:56.310
- I give up. - Cheers!

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:00.820
- Here you go. - Thank you.

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.550
- Cheers. - Gosh, this is good.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.100
All right.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.770
I'll find the hope my anxiety has been hiding.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.200
Even if I can't be the person I imagine,

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:22.910
I won't be disappointed.

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:26.980
I'm going to try and trust myself.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.050
The moment I made up my mind,

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.350
I realised something.

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:39.790
Why was I even...

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.630
hesitating?

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:52.500
- He ate two whole peppers. Oh, no! - He did?

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.100
I can't with you. Dad, seriously!

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:56.910
He ate them himself.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.680
- There's something I need to say. - Yes?

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:07.120
I'm going to marry Do Hyun.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.280
If this was your plan,

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:38.480
you should've just said yes from the start.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:41.550
Why did you...

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:43.390
have to put me through all that?

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:47.690
Because back then, that's truly how I felt.

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.100
So that sincerity...

00:34:55.930 --> 00:34:58.430
What made you change your mind?

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:02.970
Greed?

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:07.680
I couldn't get that diamond ring out of my head.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.690
The more I thought about it,

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.630
I can't find a single reason not to marry you.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.640
Ju Do Hyun.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.350
Will you marry me?

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:52.090
Are you...

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.090
proposing to me right now?

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:00.630
Yes.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:07.870
Yes.

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.170
Jun Kyung.

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:15.310
I will marry you.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.320
I miss those days.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:32.030
How you'd escort me after my performances.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.460
Just a manager doing her job.

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:40.670
How's it going? Any luck with what you went to Korea for?

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.370
It's not that easy.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:44.410
Why not?

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.610
Didn't you want it more than anything?

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.680
It seems someone else wants it more than I do.

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:54.120
Yoon Ju, you said you were suffocating here.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.550
You went there so you could finally live.

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:02.560
What are you doing, drinking alone on your birthday?

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:07.660
I miss you, Anna.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.130
Then come back.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:14.300
You can come back anytime. You have family here too, you know.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.010
Me.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:18.840
Thanks, Anna.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:35.260
Daniel.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.300
What did you think?

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:44.830
It was fun.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:46.900
No.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.140
I don't mean that.

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:53.010
About me...

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.850
and Jun Kyung...

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:58.250
getting married.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.790
Well,

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.290
I'm fine with it.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.340
Mom will probably be fine with it too.

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:36.790
Should we keep it...

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.430
a secret from Mom for now?

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:49.470
Yes.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Okay.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.700
As for your mom,

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.670
I'll be the one to tell her.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.320
Congratulations.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.220
Dad.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:16.390
Sorry I didn't say it sooner.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.870
Thanks for taking our Jun Seo in and feeding him.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:35.410
But hey,

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.750
you can just take the bed. Are you sure you'll be comfy there?

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:41.550
I love it here. I'm going to sleep right here.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.520
- Well, if you insist... - This is great.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.690
This feels like a getaway with my besties.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:52.900
I know, right?

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:57.130
I have a feeling this will be a night to remember.

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:00.170
I don't want this night to end.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.670
Then let's not let it end.

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:06.410
What?

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:12.520
Then how about we have just one more beer?

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:15.120
- Deal! - Deal!

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.550
I'll go get them!

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:25.660
Here we go.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.240
Dad, you're still up?

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:39.840
I can't sleep.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:41.740
What about you?

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:43.880
I can't either.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:51.790
Why aren't you in bed?

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:54.620
I don't think we'll get any sleep tonight.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.960
We're too busy chatting.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.230
Weren't you here to get this?

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.800
It's fine, we have more.

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.540
Here you go.

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:11.540
- Cheers. - Cheers.

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:17.880
Congratulations.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.580
I heard you're going to be teaching next semester.

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:22.150
Hye On was bragging about you.

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.990
Thanks.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:32.560
Look at you, all grown up.

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:38.600
I thought you'd tease Do Hyun, saying he'll regret marrying me.

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.300
What, you think I'm a kid?

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:45.210
I used to have...

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:48.080
a couple of worries about you two.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:54.380
Our Jun Kyung is pretty, smart, and has it all.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:59.090
But it was a shame she hadn't met someone to love.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.360
And for Jun Seo...

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.490
He's handsome, kind, a great kid.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:07.600
But a shame he hadn't found a career he was passionate about.

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:13.770
But all that worrying was for nothing.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.810
Jun Kyung, congratulations.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.140
- Thank you. - Jun Seo, you keep working hard.

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.380
Okay.

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:30.150
Thank you, kids. I know I...

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.990
haven't really done much for you.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.900
On a day like today,

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.330
I wish your mother could have been here to see this.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.250

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:20.270
Thank you for using our service.

(Limit: 5,000 dollars, Amount: 5,000 dollars)

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:06.980
(Professor Choi Sung Min, Media and Communication)

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.810
Jun Seo and I came here all the time as kids.

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:33.680
- The soup here is amazing. - Right.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:35.540
The soup? Should we sit here?

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.250
Yes, let's sit here.

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:39.620
Jun Kyung...

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:41.550
Chang Sik, long time no see!

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.950
- How've you been? You been good? - Yes. Good.

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:47.920
And this is?

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:50.990
This is my boyfriend.

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:52.960
My fiance.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:56.900
Hello. Nice to meet you.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:05.740
What has Jun Kyung told you about me?

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:12.610
She mentioned a classmate of hers became a priest.

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:17.150
Just a classmate, is that it?

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:21.960
- Yes, that's it. - Right.

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.030
It seems our Jun Kyung really likes Mr. Do Jun...

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.560
It's Do Hyun. Ju Do Hyun.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.030
Right, I'm sorry.

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:34.270
It seems our Jun Kyung must really love you, Do Hyun.

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:37.640
For her to just brush me off as a "classmate."

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:46.010
Of course.

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:48.980
I guess you don't need to know everything.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:53.860
Yes, I think that's for the best.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.030
It's probably better if you don't know.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.960
- Here you go. - You're back? Thanks.

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:04.670
I'm not letting anyone else officiate your wedding.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.370
What are you talking about?

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:08.200
You must wed in our Catholic Church. No exceptions.

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:09.710
That'd be amazing. Thank you.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.310
It's so hard to book a venue these days.

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:15.440
- Jun Kyung. - Won Yeong! Hey!

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:16.650
I just moved into this neighbourhood.

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.350
Really? That's awesome.

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:21.320
But who's...

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.990
This is the priest from the local Catholic church.

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:25.550
He's just an old high school friend.

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:29.160
- This is my boyfriend. - Hello. Nice to meet you.

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.630
Nice to meet you too.

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:33.360
But...

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:36.600
you look so familiar. Have we met?

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:38.900
I know, right?

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:42.440
You look really familiar to me too...

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:43.970
- The convenience store... - Do you have a criminal record?

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.010
Excuse me?

00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:23.450
I was so stressed I couldn't even taste the pork cutlet.

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:29.890
If I mess up with you a little bit in this town,

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:31.320
I'd be in serious trouble, wouldn't I?

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:32.690
You're just figuring that out now?

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:39.490
I'm starting to have second thoughts about this marriage.

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:42.800
Then go ahead and call it off.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:48.340
What? No, I can't do that.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.170
Our whole future is right there in front of us.

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:52.980
Goodness.

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:59.079
For our second kid, would you prefer a boy...

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.580
or a girl?

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:02.250
What? Where is this coming from all of a sudden?

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:04.650
I'm thinking a girl for the second, then a boy after that.

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:08.860
Says who there's going to be an "after that"?

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:10.960
For now,

00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:13.060
we've at least agreed that our next baby will be a girl, right?

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:18.430
Who did? Did I? I don't think so.

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.810
Jin Ho. Aren't you ready yet?

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.640
Just a second. Okay, I'm done.

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:28.980
I think it looks awkward.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.250
Hurry, come out. Let me see how you look.

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:34.450
It's weird, right?

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:39.250
It is weird. I knew it.

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.320
Shoot!

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.100
What's wrong? Is something not right with it?

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:49.530
Hurry up. I feel so awkward.

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:53.640
This is awkward. Hurry up.

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:57.210
Okay, hold on. I'm coming.

00:48:58.740 --> 00:48:59.810
Let's go. Come on.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.020
Leg. One, two, three.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.190
Say cheese!

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:52.360
Simple happiness, without anyone ever knowing...

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.300
can fill our lives to the brim.

00:49:57.970 --> 00:49:58.970
What?

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:02.370
- Ta-da. - Living our ordinary,

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.040
everyday lives...

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:06.610
Just these moments alone...

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:10.650
are fulfilling enough,

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.990
so I never expected greater happiness...

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:24.130
nor did I even wish for it.

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:28.200
But life...

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:31.400
has a way of bringing unexpected moments...

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.740
and placing them right before us.

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:40.810
My period was late, so I thought I was pregnant.

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:48.650
Are you disappointed?

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.820
I guess I got my hopes up.

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.120
But now that it's negative,

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:00.360
I'm more worried than I am disappointed.

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:05.470
What's the rush? There's no need to hurry.

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:08.800
We haven't even had the wedding yet,

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:10.670
and to be honest,

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.640
I've barely even been trying this whole time.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.780
Just wait until I start trying day and night.

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:16.980
But what if...

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.350
there's something wrong with me?

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:22.980
What could be wrong with you, Jun Kyung?

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:33.730
I'm an OB-GYN, you know.

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:39.370
I'm 38, and this would be my first.

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:46.710
Should we go get tested?

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.210
How can I get tested at my own hospital?

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.280
It'd be embarrassing at our hospital.

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:51.880
We'll just go to a different hospital.

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:54.620
Let's go together, and we'll both get tested.

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:57.850
Why? You're fine, Do Hyun.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:01.860
That's what couples are supposed to do.

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.760
They go and get tested together.

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:43.230
It's a mountain road.

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:44.630
It gets dark fast. Be careful.

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:48.000
Okay. Yes, thank you. Bye.

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.990
The number dialled is unavailable. Please leave a message.

00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:07.420
What masterpiece are you so absorbed in...

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:09.190
that you can't even answer your phone?

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.210
(Searching for driver)

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.420
- Hello? - Hey, where are you?

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:41.860
- I'm at the university. Where else? - You're going to be late again?

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:44.490
You know how my professor got that research grant.

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:47.160
He asked me to help, so what can I do?

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:50.700
My professor's calling me.

00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:52.600
I'll be late tonight, so don't wait up.

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.500
Okay.

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:09.050
I'm at what looks like a plaza right now.

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:12.050
- Okay. Yes. - Hurry up! Come on!

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.120
- Come on, hurry up! - Just one more.

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:14.320
- Just one more. - What time is it? Let's go!

00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:16.120
- What time is it? We gotta go. - Hold on! What?

00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:19.890
- The car over there! Let's go. - Okay, I see it.

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:25.430
The number dialled is unavailable. Please leave a message.

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:49.120
Ja Yeong!

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.370
Ja Yeong! Why aren't you answering your phone?

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.570
I've been looking all over for you.

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:08.310
What are you doing out here? Seriously.

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:20.390
Ja Yeong?

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:24.160
Are you okay?

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.730
I don't know where I am.

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:35.940
I don't know what I was doing here.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.570
I suddenly can't remember.

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:40.880
I was so scared.

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.750
I wanted to get home.

00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:47.980
I was trying to get back to you, Jin Ho.

00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:52.790
I don't know where this is, where I am,

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.590
and I don't know the way home.

00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:01.030
It's okay. You're okay.

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:04.270
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. Okay?

00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:05.770
It's just dark out. That's why.

00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:08.300
The path is dark, and all the trees look the same.

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.670
- Even I would have gotten lost. - No.

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:16.040
When we first moved here, I loved this forest so much...

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:19.210
I walked this path every single day without fail. You know I did.

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.280
How could I...

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:26.020
not know the way?

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:41.070
Your results look good.

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.700
Conceiving won't be an issue.

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:44.740
Really? That's such a relief.

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:47.340
See? I told you it would be fine.

00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:50.510
However, about your results, Mr. Ju...

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:52.180
Yes?

00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:56.750
I'm afraid your results were negative.

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.590
What do you mean, negative?

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:07.630
What does that mean?

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:11.870
It means you're infertile.

00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:17.870
That's impossible.

00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:21.280
Of course, nothing is ever 100 percent certain.

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:24.980
We... No...

00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:28.720
No, I mean...

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.620
I already have a child.

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.560
You do?

00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:40.530
Your hormone levels are low,

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:43.500
and based on your FSH levels,

00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:46.330
it looks like non-obstructive azoospermia.

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.999
Non-obstructive means...

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.770
it's a congenital condition.

00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:54.810
Are you absolutely sure?

00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:58.410
As I said before, there's no such thing as 100 percent.

00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:03.890
A genetic test would be the most definitive way to know.

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:11.360
If I were you, I'd talk to the child's mother.

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:23.540
Do Hyun.

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:27.880
Do Hyun.

00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:37.520
Do Hyun? I'm coming in.

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:56.800
I'm sorry.

00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:58.870
I guess I didn't hear you.

00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:16.820
I'm so sorry. This is my fault.

00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:18.130
Please, don't say that.

00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:22.800
Daniel...

00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:24.970
He's my son.

00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:31.040
I'm not going to question it any further,

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.340
and I don't need to.

00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:39.850
We can act like nothing happened. No.

00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:44.550
Nothing really did happen.

00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:47.320
And no one has to know.

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:54.960
Right? I'm right, aren't I?

00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:58.000
Daniel...

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:01.770
He's my son.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:16.520
You're right. Daniel is your son.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.720
Promise me, Jun Kyung.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.330
That you won't tell a soul...

01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:28.460
about what happened today.

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.600
All right.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:40.710
No one will ever know.

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:48.050
- So, should we go too? - Let's.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.520
Until every mom is happier...

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:05.270
(Piano Performance by Pianist Im Yoon Ju)

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.120
Yoon Ju...

01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:24.590
I wondered what your first official event back in Korea would be,

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:26.290
and it was a commercial.

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:30.890
Who reached out first?

01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:32.660
Was it Do Hyun? Or you?

01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:35.800
Does it really matter? It's not like we're strangers.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.629
We know Do Hyun too, you know.

01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:40.400
But he's never asked that of us. Has he?

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.540
Hey! Are you comparing us to her? Come on.

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:48.880
But are you okay?

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.110
About what?

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:54.150
I heard Do Hyun's getting married.

01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:58.950
Is she out of her mind?

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.600
- Who said that? - Jung Hoon.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.030
I spoke with him a few days ago. I was on the phone with him.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.940
You really had no idea?

01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:27.050
So, I hear you're getting married.

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:33.190
You don't sound like you're here to congratulate me.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.260
What do you want?

01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:38.830
I'm going to make an effort myself.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.930
What kind of effort?

01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:45.300
I'm moving to this neighbourhood.

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.370
- What? What? - I've already looked at places,

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.370
and I'm moving in next month.

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:54.210
Honestly, marriage...

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.540
What's the big deal?

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.180
As you know, we have Daniel,

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.350
but we broke up anyway.

01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:03.990
Besides, you're not married yet.

01:03:07.090 --> 01:03:08.620
What do you think you're doing?

01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:10.420
What would you do in my shoes?

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:14.360
If you're bound to lose anyway,

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.830
wouldn't you want to shatter everything?

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.000
Are people's hearts a game to you?

01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:24.140
Imagine how happy Daniel will be, living close to his dad.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:26.910
For Daniel's sake,

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.410
I'm prepared to make even more selfish choices.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.680
You don't know how Do Hyun feels.

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.220
I bet Do Hyun would be happy to have his son.

01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:54.240
There's something I need to ask you.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.740
Is Daniel really Do Hyun's son?

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.750
What did you say?

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:08.220
Is Daniel really Do Hyun's biological son?

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:16.860
(Love Me)

01:04:49.590 --> 01:04:52.830
I'm going to get famous and be even more successful now.

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:54.130
So you'd better feel the pressure.

01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:58.070
I have no desire to congratulate you on your award.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.140
You want me to break up with you, don't you?

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.170
You stupid jerk.

01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:05.310
There's nothing to worry about.

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:08.210
I came to make sure everything's okay.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.480
Darn it!

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.250
I truly wanted you to be happy.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.150
And I thought I could be happy by your side.

01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:17.750
But I don't think that's going to happen now.

01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:22.390
Is that really what you think?

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.460
That Daniel isn't your son?

01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:29.260
Is liking you a crime worthy of this punishment?

01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:31.370
Why did you do that?

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.470
We promised we wouldn't say anything.

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:36.900
I know I'm the one who was wrong,

01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:41.240
but I still wish he'd ask me to stay.
