(Yuehai Dock)

00:01:41.132 --> 00:01:42.013
There are five of us.

00:01:43.292 --> 00:01:43.653
Let's go.

00:01:45.852 --> 00:01:48.412
Zhiqiang, why are you
carrying so few things?

00:01:48.653 --> 00:01:51.000
Even if Dad doesn't come back,
I'll return soon.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.052
What for?

00:01:55.653 --> 00:01:57.692
Desheng.

00:01:59.173 --> 00:01:59.692
Desheng.

00:02:00.613 --> 00:02:01.973
- Mr. Zheng.
- I'm looking for someone.

00:02:02.173 --> 00:02:02.973
Alright, Mr. Zheng.

00:02:03.932 --> 00:02:06.212
Desheng.

00:02:09.093 --> 00:02:09.592
Desheng.

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:12.253
Where are you going?

00:02:14.572 --> 00:02:16.452
Desheng, Ms. Li said

00:02:17.172 --> 00:02:19.773
that a city must
uphold its spirit, character,

00:02:20.093 --> 00:02:20.852
and civility.

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:22.373
She is right.

00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:24.053
Since she's right,

00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:25.653
why should we oppose it?

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:27.732
I-I'm not opposing it.

00:02:28.012 --> 00:02:28.773
But your leaving

00:02:28.973 --> 00:02:30.493
looks like a silent protest.

00:02:30.732 --> 00:02:32.373
I'll be the bad guy no matter what.

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:33.452
Desheng.

00:02:35.813 --> 00:02:36.213
Well...

00:02:37.213 --> 00:02:38.852
Decheng.

00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:41.773
Your big brother and I
have lived our whole lives

00:02:42.493 --> 00:02:44.612
without anyone finding fault with us.

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:46.732
Now your brother's name

00:02:47.253 --> 00:02:48.892
was announced over the loudspeaker.

00:02:49.132 --> 00:02:50.692
The whole town knows.

00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:53.292
He feels so ashamed.

00:02:54.053 --> 00:02:56.333
It feels like the sky has fallen.
He can't stay.

00:02:56.612 --> 00:02:58.732
Enough, why are you saying that?

00:02:58.852 --> 00:02:59.773
But we really...

00:02:59.852 --> 00:03:00.933
Enough, say no more.

00:03:02.053 --> 00:03:02.572
Decheng.

00:03:04.053 --> 00:03:06.773
Sorry I embarrassed you.

00:03:10.093 --> 00:03:11.448
To further improve

00:03:11.448 --> 00:03:13.452
the overall sanitation level in Yuehai,

00:03:13.773 --> 00:03:15.973
the Health Management
Regulation specifies

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:18.093
the reward and penalty measures.

00:03:18.973 --> 00:03:21.533
First: No littering.

00:03:21.852 --> 00:03:23.813
No public urination or defecation...

00:03:27.892 --> 00:03:31.412
V-Violators will be f-fined five yuan.

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:34.653
Well...

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:35.692
Desheng.

00:03:35.852 --> 00:03:37.773
Ms. Li, thank you.

00:03:38.973 --> 00:03:41.653
I have to pay the fine.

00:03:43.653 --> 00:03:45.333
Desheng...

00:03:46.452 --> 00:03:46.852
But...

00:03:55.093 --> 00:03:55.813
Ms. Li.

00:03:56.292 --> 00:03:58.653
Your idea is very good.

00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:01.813
But putting it into practice takes time.

00:04:02.213 --> 00:04:04.933
We can't rush it too much.

00:04:08.892 --> 00:04:11.373
Mr. Zheng, do you know why I'm rushing?

00:04:13.892 --> 00:04:15.732
Watermelon, my favorite.

00:04:15.732 --> 00:04:17.013
- Have some watermelon.
- Okay.

00:04:17.492 --> 00:04:19.533
I want to eat watermelon in China, too.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:20.973
Look at that.

00:04:21.973 --> 00:04:22.533
It's good.

00:04:23.052 --> 00:04:23.653
It's good.

00:04:23.852 --> 00:04:24.412
Is it good?

00:04:24.492 --> 00:04:25.133
Thank you.

00:04:25.133 --> 00:04:26.040
Are you getting this?

00:04:27.932 --> 00:04:28.653
This is serious.

00:04:37.812 --> 00:04:38.412
Stop it.

00:04:39.492 --> 00:04:40.213
Oh my.

00:04:40.732 --> 00:04:41.333
I told you.

00:04:48.653 --> 00:04:49.812
I really like Yuehai.

00:04:50.612 --> 00:04:52.893
I like its chaos and energy.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:55.852
But my father wants to invest

00:04:55.852 --> 00:04:57.453
in a city with potential.

00:04:58.852 --> 00:05:00.573
Yuehai remains a rural area.

00:05:02.013 --> 00:05:04.213
Mr. Zheng,
those are Monica's exact words.

00:05:06.093 --> 00:05:06.973
I've been thinking.

00:05:08.453 --> 00:05:09.528
On this matter,

00:05:10.072 --> 00:05:11.612
I was indeed too eager

00:05:12.693 --> 00:05:13.973
for quick results.

00:05:16.013 --> 00:05:17.612
We missed the opportunity.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:22.133
We must face our problem.

00:05:22.773 --> 00:05:23.412
Hooligan!

00:05:23.412 --> 00:05:23.973
Who?

00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:24.932
The one in blue.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.133
What did you do?

00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:42.213
Mr. Zheng, where did Desheng go?

00:05:50.412 --> 00:05:52.893
Hello, everyone in Yuehai.

00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:57.213
My name is Zheng Desheng.

00:05:59.213 --> 00:06:00.172
Well...

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:02.052
Last night,

00:06:02.852 --> 00:06:05.013
I dumped the garbage

00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:08.893
casually onto the ground

00:06:09.773 --> 00:06:11.573
for my own convenience.

00:06:15.052 --> 00:06:16.732
I was wrong.

00:06:17.973 --> 00:06:19.064
I caused trouble

00:06:20.376 --> 00:06:21.292
for my brother.

00:06:23.252 --> 00:06:25.732
And of course,

00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:27.693
for everyone.

00:06:28.973 --> 00:06:29.432
I...

00:06:31.032 --> 00:06:32.492
I really regret it.

00:06:34.453 --> 00:06:35.333
You know.

00:06:36.573 --> 00:06:39.093
I also saw what they played

00:06:40.013 --> 00:06:41.693
on TV.

00:06:42.693 --> 00:06:44.492
Some of our habits

00:06:44.973 --> 00:06:46.893
are quite bad.

00:06:47.973 --> 00:06:50.412
We're not exactly clean.

00:06:51.732 --> 00:06:52.760
I think

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.453
it's time to change.

00:06:58.252 --> 00:06:59.533
Let's start today.

00:07:00.852 --> 00:07:02.013
Starting with me.

00:07:02.573 --> 00:07:05.693
Everyone should lend a hand.

00:07:06.932 --> 00:07:07.732
Together,

00:07:08.973 --> 00:07:13.013
we will surely do better.

00:07:14.732 --> 00:07:15.573
Well...

00:07:17.292 --> 00:07:19.412
I-I'm done.

00:07:36.093 --> 00:07:37.333
Well said. Let's do it.

00:07:38.732 --> 00:07:39.093
Wait.

00:07:39.412 --> 00:07:39.893
Get to work.

00:07:40.052 --> 00:07:40.693
Wait for me.

00:07:43.893 --> 00:07:44.773
Attention please.

00:07:45.653 --> 00:07:46.492
Starting today,

00:07:47.013 --> 00:07:47.773
we will carry out

00:07:48.133 --> 00:07:50.893
a full-scale
cleanup and improvement campaign.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:53.732
This will cover every street

00:07:54.172 --> 00:07:55.612
and every single household.

00:07:56.492 --> 00:07:57.732
Each household cleans

00:07:58.453 --> 00:07:59.372
its own doorstep.

00:07:59.973 --> 00:08:02.052
Each street will
have a designated leader.

00:08:02.693 --> 00:08:04.492
They will be responsible.

00:08:08.492 --> 00:08:10.852
Tan, announce the specific plan.

00:08:11.213 --> 00:08:11.573
Okay.

00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:14.252
Here is

00:08:14.693 --> 00:08:16.533
our management plan.

00:08:17.133 --> 00:08:19.612
First: Due to
insufficient police personnel,

00:08:20.172 --> 00:08:23.052
our town government
will establish its own management team.

00:08:23.533 --> 00:08:25.573
This team will be called

00:08:25.612 --> 00:08:26.773
the City Management Team,

00:08:27.292 --> 00:08:29.052
consisting of you people.

00:08:37.293 --> 00:08:38.732
Sorry, I wasn't aiming at you.

00:08:40.413 --> 00:08:42.053
Excuse me, what's your name?

00:08:42.652 --> 00:08:43.333
Zhuangzhuang.

00:08:43.973 --> 00:08:45.532
I must criticize you.

00:08:45.973 --> 00:08:47.612
How can you sleep while I'm speaking?

00:08:47.973 --> 00:08:48.973
And look at you.

00:08:49.372 --> 00:08:51.413
How can you serve the people like this?

00:08:53.372 --> 00:08:54.372
Serve the people.

00:08:54.813 --> 00:08:55.573
Be serious.

00:08:57.333 --> 00:08:59.256
Why did I write "Serve the People"

00:08:59.256 --> 00:09:00.372
on the blackboard?

00:09:00.372 --> 00:09:00.632
(Serve the People)

00:09:00.632 --> 00:09:01.053
(Yuehai Town People's Government,
Yuehai Town Committee)

00:09:01.053 --> 00:09:01.973
Because this team

00:09:02.213 --> 00:09:04.573
will exist to serve the people.

00:09:05.053 --> 00:09:06.136
This team

00:09:06.552 --> 00:09:08.293
is empowered by the people of Yuehai.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.008
Got it?

00:09:10.418 --> 00:09:11.160
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:09:11.772 --> 00:09:14.492
(These people were
Yuehai's first city inspectors.)

00:09:15.416 --> 00:09:18.008
(They grew alongside urbanization,)

00:09:18.776 --> 00:09:20.248
(helping new urban residents)

00:09:20.568 --> 00:09:22.264
(strive towards better lives.)

00:09:22.264 --> 00:09:23.462
Maintain city order.

00:09:23.986 --> 00:09:25.944
Maintain city order.

00:09:26.372 --> 00:09:28.012
Manage the environment.

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:30.053
Manage the environment.

00:09:30.573 --> 00:09:32.693
Second: We'll properly

00:09:32.732 --> 00:09:34.413
add public toilets

00:09:34.492 --> 00:09:35.933
to the ready-built streets.

00:09:35.933 --> 00:09:38.360
(No public urination or defecation)
♪Who can still remember♪

00:09:39.693 --> 00:09:42.372
Third: We'll build markets and groceries

00:09:42.532 --> 00:09:44.413
in central residential areas.

00:09:44.532 --> 00:09:45.772
Yeah, over there.

00:09:45.973 --> 00:09:47.333
Vegetables go that way.

00:09:48.012 --> 00:09:50.293
Seafood and meat stay here.

00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:51.453
Find your stalls.

00:09:51.612 --> 00:09:54.532
From now on,
each vendor stays at their own stall.

00:09:54.852 --> 00:09:55.813
It'll be permanent.

00:09:55.933 --> 00:09:56.852
Think of it as home.

00:09:57.053 --> 00:09:58.333
Keep it clean and tidy,

00:09:58.772 --> 00:10:00.372
spotless and well-organized.

00:10:00.652 --> 00:10:01.492
Remember.

00:10:01.693 --> 00:10:02.652
Starting tonight,

00:10:03.012 --> 00:10:04.213
I'll come to inspect

00:10:04.973 --> 00:10:06.813
at 7:10 PM every day.

00:10:07.093 --> 00:10:09.213
Whoever fails to keep the stall clean

00:10:09.573 --> 00:10:10.333
will be kicked out.

00:10:10.772 --> 00:10:11.252
Got it?

00:10:11.573 --> 00:10:12.173
- Got it.
- Got it.

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:13.372
Okay.

00:10:13.652 --> 00:10:15.132
Fourth: Set up

00:10:15.173 --> 00:10:16.933
a designated livestock farming area.

00:10:17.213 --> 00:10:18.652
Residents with large numbers

00:10:18.813 --> 00:10:20.093
of poultry or livestock

00:10:20.413 --> 00:10:21.772
must keep them there.

00:10:22.132 --> 00:10:23.532
Don't take offense.

00:10:23.852 --> 00:10:25.532
Yuehai is a city now.

00:10:26.012 --> 00:10:28.732
It must differ
from the countryside, right?

00:10:29.093 --> 00:10:30.132
You'll get used to it.

00:10:30.372 --> 00:10:31.732
Ducks. Chickens.

00:10:32.053 --> 00:10:33.293
This way.

00:10:33.813 --> 00:10:35.612
Once we're there,
we'll sort it out, okay?

00:10:36.132 --> 00:10:36.933
Over here.

00:10:39.384 --> 00:10:41.584
(When you feel sad, watch the sunrise.)

00:10:41.584 --> 00:10:43.054
(It will warm your heart.)

00:10:57.612 --> 00:10:59.933
More greenery, more warmth.

00:11:00.453 --> 00:11:02.492
Plant hope, nurture prosperity,

00:11:02.732 --> 00:11:04.053
and enhance our city's image.

00:11:05.053 --> 00:11:06.213
Good saplings.

00:11:06.293 --> 00:11:07.933
Desheng.

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:09.053
Ms. Li.

00:11:10.053 --> 00:11:11.173
Want a sapling?

00:11:12.012 --> 00:11:12.973
No, thanks.

00:11:13.372 --> 00:11:15.293
I'm still struggling.

00:11:15.933 --> 00:11:18.612
I'm trying

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.053
to fix up that house

00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:24.413
so we can settle down here.

00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:27.012
We'll hold off on buying saplings.

00:11:27.293 --> 00:11:29.492
No problem. I'll gift you one.

00:11:29.813 --> 00:11:30.612
No, no.

00:11:30.852 --> 00:11:31.372
Ms. Li.

00:11:31.372 --> 00:11:32.173
It's okay.

00:11:32.173 --> 00:11:32.892
- Take it.
- I can't.

00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:34.333
- It's auspicious.
- No. Well...

00:11:34.333 --> 00:11:35.053
It's auspicious.

00:11:35.413 --> 00:11:36.173
All the best.

00:11:36.532 --> 00:11:37.492
It's auspicious?

00:11:37.852 --> 00:11:38.532
Alright then.

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:39.772
Thank you, Ms. Li.

00:11:40.173 --> 00:11:40.852
Desheng.

00:11:41.293 --> 00:11:44.213
Do you truly want to settle down here?

00:11:44.492 --> 00:11:45.173
Of course.

00:11:45.453 --> 00:11:46.693
Would you like some advice?

00:11:49.053 --> 00:11:49.413
Well...

00:11:50.173 --> 00:11:52.532
That'd be nice.

00:11:52.772 --> 00:11:54.012
I'm listening.

00:11:55.093 --> 00:11:55.933
Be careful.

00:11:56.252 --> 00:11:56.532
Go.

00:11:56.693 --> 00:11:57.413
I'll go first.

00:11:57.652 --> 00:11:58.772
Yeah, tilt it.

00:11:59.012 --> 00:12:00.213
Steady it from below.

00:12:00.213 --> 00:12:00.892
Hold it steady.

00:12:00.892 --> 00:12:01.413
Okay.

00:12:01.413 --> 00:12:02.012
Careful now.

00:12:02.012 --> 00:12:02.973
Watch the table corner.

00:12:03.093 --> 00:12:04.093
The corner. Slow down.

00:12:04.173 --> 00:12:05.813
Yeah, keep going.

00:12:06.132 --> 00:12:06.573
Keep going.

00:12:06.573 --> 00:12:07.012
Slow down.

00:12:07.012 --> 00:12:07.612
Careful.

00:12:07.612 --> 00:12:08.132
The legs.

00:12:08.573 --> 00:12:09.252
Be careful.

00:12:09.413 --> 00:12:10.372
This table is precious.

00:12:10.372 --> 00:12:11.173
Be careful.

00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:12.372
You're not helping.

00:12:12.532 --> 00:12:13.453
So be quiet.

00:12:13.612 --> 00:12:14.732
Stop barking orders.

00:12:14.772 --> 00:12:16.813
Zhiqiang is right.

00:12:16.973 --> 00:12:17.213
Okay.

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:20.053
This table has seen many years.

00:12:20.492 --> 00:12:22.372
Dad, you're just favoring him.

00:12:22.532 --> 00:12:22.892
Watch it.

00:12:23.132 --> 00:12:23.652
Zhiqiang.

00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:26.293
Put it in the middle of the room.

00:12:27.012 --> 00:12:28.053
We'll eat soon.

00:12:28.413 --> 00:12:29.293
Got it, Dad.

00:12:30.093 --> 00:12:31.413
Put the table in the center.

00:12:31.612 --> 00:12:31.933
Desheng.

00:12:31.933 --> 00:12:32.453
Got it.

00:12:32.612 --> 00:12:32.973
Uncle.

00:12:33.213 --> 00:12:33.973
Uncle Dongfu.

00:12:34.012 --> 00:12:34.372
Desheng.

00:12:34.453 --> 00:12:35.333
Hello, sis-in-law.

00:12:35.372 --> 00:12:35.973
Give it to me.

00:12:36.293 --> 00:12:36.973
Hello, Desheng.

00:12:37.492 --> 00:12:38.093
Ma'am.

00:12:38.252 --> 00:12:39.012
Come on in.

00:12:39.532 --> 00:12:40.652
Desheng, you're amazing.

00:12:41.173 --> 00:12:41.772
You basically

00:12:41.852 --> 00:12:44.252
moved all our family heirlooms over.

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:46.652
This door.

00:12:46.732 --> 00:12:48.093
- And these windows.
- The windows.

00:12:49.053 --> 00:12:50.453
I remember these.

00:12:51.173 --> 00:12:53.652
How did you come up with this idea?

00:12:54.772 --> 00:12:56.293
It wasn't my idea.

00:12:56.532 --> 00:12:58.892
Ms. Li suggested it.

00:12:59.173 --> 00:13:03.413
I moved the windowsills and door frames
from our old house.

00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:07.132
It looks just like our old house, right?

00:13:07.293 --> 00:13:07.693
Yeah.

00:13:10.132 --> 00:13:11.612
Actually, Ms. Li

00:13:12.173 --> 00:13:13.252
is very nice.

00:13:13.573 --> 00:13:14.892
No airs about her.

00:13:15.453 --> 00:13:17.132
She's capable and hardworking.

00:13:17.492 --> 00:13:20.252
Most importantly,
she truly cares about us.

00:13:21.093 --> 00:13:21.612
Yeah.

00:13:22.053 --> 00:13:22.492
Yeah.

00:13:22.732 --> 00:13:23.293
Right?

00:13:23.813 --> 00:13:25.532
Lin, let me show you something.

00:13:26.012 --> 00:13:27.732
This mark is my height at thirteen.

00:13:27.892 --> 00:13:29.453
This is twelve, and this is ten.

00:13:29.532 --> 00:13:30.852
This is from when I was eight.

00:13:30.852 --> 00:13:32.693
"Serve the country loyally".

00:13:32.693 --> 00:13:33.372
(Serve the country loyally)

00:13:33.372 --> 00:13:34.372
I carved that too.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:37.093
It was my childhood wish and ambition.

00:13:38.293 --> 00:13:39.933
Zhiqiang, let's measure your height.

00:13:40.093 --> 00:13:40.612
Okay.

00:13:40.852 --> 00:13:41.612
Hold this.

00:13:44.293 --> 00:13:45.293
You're quite tall.

00:13:45.372 --> 00:13:45.772
Really?

00:13:46.093 --> 00:13:47.132
You're almost my height,

00:13:47.612 --> 00:13:48.492
maybe even taller.

00:13:48.852 --> 00:13:49.612
Really?

00:13:50.732 --> 00:13:51.372
Come on, guys.

00:13:51.652 --> 00:13:52.453
Measure your height.

00:13:52.453 --> 00:13:52.952
Come on.

00:13:54.453 --> 00:13:54.852
Me?

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:56.132
You're taller.

00:13:56.492 --> 00:13:57.053
Tallest.

00:13:57.372 --> 00:13:58.252
Come on, kiddo.

00:13:58.453 --> 00:13:59.320
I'm a bit shorter.

00:13:59.732 --> 00:14:01.693
A bit shorter? You're a lot shorter.

00:14:02.012 --> 00:14:03.892
You need nutrition.

00:14:05.053 --> 00:14:07.132
Let me take a photo of you guys

00:14:07.132 --> 00:14:07.772
with your uncle.

00:14:07.973 --> 00:14:08.852
Let's take a photo.

00:14:08.852 --> 00:14:09.453
Okay.

00:14:10.372 --> 00:14:11.413
Look over here.

00:14:11.693 --> 00:14:13.532
Okay, one, two, three.

00:14:13.892 --> 00:14:14.213
Done.

00:14:17.368 --> 00:14:21.112
♪Ambition surges like the Yangtze♪

00:14:21.112 --> 00:14:25.048
♪Great causes follow the Party's lead♪

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.599
♪Sweat soaks this passionate land♪

00:14:31.813 --> 00:14:34.772
Mr. Zheng, that design
might not be so good.

00:14:35.732 --> 00:14:37.532
Xuemei, what a coincidence.

00:14:37.772 --> 00:14:39.532
I was looking at the uniform

00:14:39.532 --> 00:14:41.372
you designed for our city inspectors.

00:14:41.453 --> 00:14:42.413
- Yeah.
- Good job.

00:14:42.573 --> 00:14:43.132
Well done.

00:14:43.372 --> 00:14:44.293
Don't mention it.

00:14:44.813 --> 00:14:46.372
It's my duty as Xie's family member.

00:14:46.933 --> 00:14:48.132
Here's the invitation

00:14:48.213 --> 00:14:49.573
to the opening ceremony.

00:14:51.012 --> 00:14:52.772
Best wishes for the grand opening.

00:14:54.248 --> 00:14:55.096
(Invitation)

00:14:55.813 --> 00:14:56.652
Well...

00:14:58.093 --> 00:14:58.933
That's it.

00:14:59.053 --> 00:15:01.293
Then I'll be going.

00:15:01.492 --> 00:15:02.132
Take care.

00:15:02.293 --> 00:15:03.813
Alright, I won't see you out.

00:15:07.132 --> 00:15:07.772
Xuemei.

00:15:09.852 --> 00:15:11.173
Is something bothering you?

00:15:11.173 --> 00:15:13.093
Why are you sighing?

00:15:14.173 --> 00:15:15.732
Come on, just tell me.

00:15:15.772 --> 00:15:16.732
Take a seat.

00:15:17.252 --> 00:15:17.933
Come on.

00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:20.933
No wonder they say that you have eyes

00:15:21.333 --> 00:15:22.413
that see everything.

00:15:22.693 --> 00:15:23.892
Stop flattering me.

00:15:24.012 --> 00:15:25.053
Really, I mean it.

00:15:27.413 --> 00:15:28.732
Let me be honest with you.

00:15:29.293 --> 00:15:30.732
At this point,

00:15:31.772 --> 00:15:33.213
our opening is our closing.

00:15:34.612 --> 00:15:35.612
What do you mean?

00:15:36.892 --> 00:15:38.213
Look, Mr. Zheng.

00:15:38.453 --> 00:15:39.612
Back in Jiangku,

00:15:39.732 --> 00:15:42.173
the factory was small with few workers.

00:15:42.612 --> 00:15:45.573
Having fewer orders
wasn't a problem for us.

00:15:46.053 --> 00:15:47.933
But now we're in Yuehai.

00:15:48.132 --> 00:15:50.252
With a bigger factory and more workers,

00:15:50.933 --> 00:15:52.892
the orders can't keep up.

00:15:53.772 --> 00:15:54.612
To be honest.

00:15:55.173 --> 00:15:56.612
The order I'm working on

00:15:56.973 --> 00:15:58.372
is already the last one.

00:15:58.973 --> 00:16:00.132
Then why are you opening?

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:01.573
We got the plot

00:16:02.093 --> 00:16:03.372
and renovated everything.

00:16:03.612 --> 00:16:04.732
We're ready to go.

00:16:05.132 --> 00:16:06.293
What should I do?

00:16:10.213 --> 00:16:11.173
What about the others?

00:16:12.492 --> 00:16:13.813
Our factory is the biggest.

00:16:14.093 --> 00:16:14.973
Even we can't hold up,

00:16:15.053 --> 00:16:16.492
let alone the smaller ones.

00:16:17.012 --> 00:16:19.012
Two have already closed down.

00:16:20.492 --> 00:16:22.852
It's serious. Why didn't Xie tell me?

00:16:23.492 --> 00:16:25.213
I asked him to tell you.

00:16:25.372 --> 00:16:26.413
But he said

00:16:26.772 --> 00:16:29.532
that he must set an example as a cadre

00:16:29.772 --> 00:16:32.173
and not bother the higher-ups
with private matters.

00:16:32.293 --> 00:16:33.973
But this isn't a private matter.

00:16:35.053 --> 00:16:36.732
Xie should have told me.

00:16:37.093 --> 00:16:38.053
He lacks awareness...

00:16:38.173 --> 00:16:40.213
Wasn't Changyuan helping you get orders?

00:16:40.612 --> 00:16:42.813
Yeah, Changyuan does know many clients.

00:16:43.213 --> 00:16:45.333
But the costs were low
back in the countryside.

00:16:45.732 --> 00:16:46.813
Now the costs are higher.

00:16:47.413 --> 00:16:48.772
And the order hasn't kept up.

00:16:49.693 --> 00:16:50.132
So...

00:16:50.173 --> 00:16:51.293
Alright, I see.

00:16:51.612 --> 00:16:54.973
You have extra mouths to feed,
but your income hasn't increased.

00:16:55.173 --> 00:16:56.333
Right? Is that it?

00:16:56.453 --> 00:16:57.892
Yeah, that's it.

00:16:58.173 --> 00:17:00.213
Alright, I'll figure something out.

00:17:01.173 --> 00:17:01.892
That's great.

00:17:02.532 --> 00:17:05.173
With your word, I feel relieved.

00:17:05.252 --> 00:17:06.772
Okay, no problem. Leave it to me.

00:17:09.252 --> 00:17:09.893
How much is it?

00:17:10.092 --> 00:17:10.973
Fifty cents each.

00:17:11.012 --> 00:17:11.613
Fifty cents?

00:17:11.812 --> 00:17:12.853
Mr. Zheng.

00:17:13.092 --> 00:17:14.572
Mr. Zheng.

00:17:15.133 --> 00:17:16.092
Mr. Tan, what's wrong?

00:17:16.213 --> 00:17:19.052
Didn't I give you 90 yuan
for reception expenses?

00:17:19.532 --> 00:17:20.933
You didn't write a receipt.

00:17:21.052 --> 00:17:22.532
I'll do it once I'm back.

00:17:22.532 --> 00:17:23.772
Financial regulations.

00:17:24.092 --> 00:17:24.693
Come on.

00:17:24.812 --> 00:17:25.693
Have a cigarette.

00:17:25.732 --> 00:17:26.492
No, no.

00:17:26.492 --> 00:17:27.052
Come on.

00:17:27.052 --> 00:17:27.693
Come on.

00:17:27.693 --> 00:17:28.812
- I can't.
- Have one.

00:17:28.812 --> 00:17:30.252
I'll spend as little as possible

00:17:30.532 --> 00:17:31.653
and return the rest to you.

00:17:31.653 --> 00:17:32.613
Okay.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.360
(Zheng Decheng)

00:17:35.812 --> 00:17:37.893
Mr. Zheng, one more thing.

00:17:39.012 --> 00:17:39.572
Ms. Gao

00:17:39.933 --> 00:17:42.173
is holding
the factory opening ceremony today.

00:17:44.332 --> 00:17:45.492
Isn't Ms. Li there?

00:17:46.213 --> 00:17:46.772
Yeah.

00:17:55.853 --> 00:17:56.732
Go wait for me.

00:17:57.973 --> 00:17:58.893
Get going.

00:17:58.893 --> 00:18:00.213
Something I shouldn't hear?

00:18:00.373 --> 00:18:01.012
Seriously.

00:18:01.812 --> 00:18:02.973
Here, take your ticket.

00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:08.413
What's wrong?

00:18:08.933 --> 00:18:10.173
Got a problem with Ms. Li?

00:18:10.373 --> 00:18:10.933
It's not that.

00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:12.572
I don't have a problem with her.

00:18:13.332 --> 00:18:14.453
Let me make it clear.

00:18:14.492 --> 00:18:15.933
I'm definitely

00:18:15.933 --> 00:18:17.653
not talking behind anyone's back, okay?

00:18:18.133 --> 00:18:19.572
Got it, just spit it out.

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:21.653
I-I just want to say

00:18:22.732 --> 00:18:24.572
that Gao Xuemei's factory has a problem.

00:18:25.292 --> 00:18:25.812
What problem?

00:18:26.693 --> 00:18:28.732
She's hired over 20 workers.

00:18:29.213 --> 00:18:30.492
What's wrong with it?

00:18:30.653 --> 00:18:31.613
I...

00:18:31.893 --> 00:18:33.532
Have you forgotten? Back in 1981,

00:18:33.656 --> 00:18:35.224
the State Council issued a document.

00:18:35.613 --> 00:18:37.693
Policies and regulations
on non-agricultural

00:18:37.732 --> 00:18:39.373
self-employment in urban areas.

00:18:40.812 --> 00:18:41.373
That one.

00:18:43.092 --> 00:18:44.092
I remember now.

00:18:45.413 --> 00:18:47.052
It's the policy

00:18:47.613 --> 00:18:49.933
that self-employed individuals
can only hire seven workers?

00:18:50.572 --> 00:18:51.453
That's it.

00:18:51.933 --> 00:18:52.332
Oh no.

00:18:53.373 --> 00:18:54.893
T-This is troublesome.

00:18:57.453 --> 00:18:58.572
The other factories?

00:18:59.012 --> 00:19:00.572
They haven't opened yet.

00:19:00.613 --> 00:19:02.173
But they're preparing for it.

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:04.252
Once they open,

00:19:04.653 --> 00:19:07.052
they'll all face this issue
to some degree.

00:19:07.133 --> 00:19:09.413
More factories mean bigger problems.

00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:11.492
Why worry before it happens?

00:19:11.812 --> 00:19:13.693
Let them open first, and then we'll see.

00:19:14.012 --> 00:19:15.213
Getting factories running

00:19:15.373 --> 00:19:16.703
is the top priority.

00:19:16.703 --> 00:19:17.373
You understand?

00:19:18.332 --> 00:19:19.772
Come here, let me tell you.

00:19:20.252 --> 00:19:22.413
Let them open the factories, right?

00:19:22.853 --> 00:19:23.492
After that,

00:19:23.732 --> 00:19:26.133
survey each factory thoroughly.

00:19:27.012 --> 00:19:28.213
Tally the worker count.

00:19:28.572 --> 00:19:29.693
Then draft me a report.

00:19:30.092 --> 00:19:30.492
Okay.

00:19:30.732 --> 00:19:32.292
Make the report detailed.

00:19:32.893 --> 00:19:35.413
Take your time. Cover everything.

00:19:36.893 --> 00:19:37.413
Stop nodding.

00:19:37.413 --> 00:19:38.332
Do you understand?

00:19:38.413 --> 00:19:39.693
Yeah, you want a report.

00:19:39.772 --> 00:19:40.853
I'll document

00:19:40.973 --> 00:19:42.092
every piece of data.

00:19:42.173 --> 00:19:43.613
But then what?

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:45.572
Then... Watch me.

00:19:51.853 --> 00:19:53.052
I'm watching. Go on.

00:19:54.492 --> 00:19:55.413
What am I doing?

00:19:57.292 --> 00:19:57.973
I got it.

00:19:58.133 --> 00:19:59.693
Turning a blind eye.

00:19:59.693 --> 00:20:01.453
You have to make me spell it out?

00:20:02.133 --> 00:20:02.613
But I...

00:20:02.653 --> 00:20:03.653
Go back and tell Xie.

00:20:04.772 --> 00:20:05.453
Only six workers

00:20:06.133 --> 00:20:08.373
are allowed at the opening ceremony.

00:20:08.613 --> 00:20:09.373
Not one more.

00:20:13.812 --> 00:20:14.732
Bottoms up.

00:20:15.492 --> 00:20:16.173
Mr. Zheng.

00:20:16.453 --> 00:20:17.373
This liquor

00:20:17.653 --> 00:20:18.413
is top-notch.

00:20:18.413 --> 00:20:19.012
Towel.

00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:20.373
Don't bother.

00:20:20.453 --> 00:20:21.492
I'll take care of him.

00:20:21.492 --> 00:20:22.292
One more.

00:20:22.332 --> 00:20:23.653
Come on, one more.

00:20:23.853 --> 00:20:24.613
I'll go first.

00:20:24.893 --> 00:20:25.653
Fill it up.

00:20:25.772 --> 00:20:27.133
In that case...

00:20:27.413 --> 00:20:28.092
Fill it up.

00:20:28.732 --> 00:20:29.492
Fill it up.

00:20:29.572 --> 00:20:31.772
You're coming to Yuehai
with such sincerity.

00:20:31.853 --> 00:20:32.853
As the Secretary,

00:20:33.213 --> 00:20:35.492
I must welcome you
with equal sincerity, right?

00:20:35.532 --> 00:20:36.413
I'll fill mine too.

00:20:36.413 --> 00:20:36.973
How?

00:20:37.133 --> 00:20:37.592
Like this.

00:20:37.693 --> 00:20:38.853
I'll fill mine too.

00:20:39.052 --> 00:20:40.572
With this, right?

00:20:40.812 --> 00:20:41.572
A full cup.

00:20:41.893 --> 00:20:42.693
Here we go.

00:20:42.772 --> 00:20:43.933
Towel, Mr. Zheng.

00:20:44.332 --> 00:20:45.292
Come on.

00:20:45.572 --> 00:20:46.133
Mr. Zheng.

00:20:46.173 --> 00:20:46.732
Fill it up.

00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:47.173
Come on.

00:20:47.252 --> 00:20:47.933
Come on.

00:20:48.133 --> 00:20:48.772
Come on.

00:20:48.856 --> 00:20:50.173
You sure can hold your liquor.

00:20:50.453 --> 00:20:51.732
I'll drink.

00:20:52.092 --> 00:20:53.693
I must toast you with my full heart.

00:20:56.732 --> 00:20:58.173
Keep it steady.

00:20:59.613 --> 00:21:01.453
I'm not drunk yet. Keep pouring.

00:21:01.572 --> 00:21:03.413
My stomach's a bit empty.

00:21:03.653 --> 00:21:04.413
Easy.

00:21:04.413 --> 00:21:05.373
I can drink more.

00:21:05.732 --> 00:21:06.812
I'm not drunk.

00:21:07.012 --> 00:21:07.453
Yeah.

00:21:07.613 --> 00:21:08.133
You...

00:21:09.453 --> 00:21:10.453
Be careful.

00:21:10.732 --> 00:21:11.973
Easy...

00:21:12.052 --> 00:21:13.133
See? You're drunk.

00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:13.853
Well...

00:21:15.332 --> 00:21:15.693
Well...

00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:17.613
Slow down.

00:21:18.133 --> 00:21:19.453
D-Don't hold me.

00:21:20.973 --> 00:21:21.532
Listen to me.

00:21:22.133 --> 00:21:24.012
We drank well.

00:21:24.213 --> 00:21:24.653
Yeah.

00:21:25.052 --> 00:21:26.653
He's a good leader.

00:21:27.173 --> 00:21:27.572
Yeah.

00:21:28.133 --> 00:21:28.772
Straightforward.

00:21:29.133 --> 00:21:31.893
In your local lingo, it's "absolutely".

00:21:33.812 --> 00:21:34.613
Mr. Zheng.

00:21:36.173 --> 00:21:36.973
I like you.

00:21:38.572 --> 00:21:39.492
I like you.

00:21:40.373 --> 00:21:41.693
Let's do this again.

00:21:43.173 --> 00:21:45.173
We'll drink again till we're wasted.

00:21:45.332 --> 00:21:46.052
Absolutely.

00:21:46.133 --> 00:21:46.613
Absolutely.

00:21:46.893 --> 00:21:47.653
Give me a hug.

00:21:48.772 --> 00:21:50.133
I drank on an empty stomach.

00:21:50.252 --> 00:21:51.133
We'll drink again

00:21:51.213 --> 00:21:51.812
after the food.

00:21:51.853 --> 00:21:52.492
No problem.

00:21:52.532 --> 00:21:53.252
We'll drink.

00:21:54.572 --> 00:21:55.288
See you tomorrow.

00:21:55.413 --> 00:21:55.973
I'm off.

00:21:56.653 --> 00:21:57.453
Let's go.

00:21:58.052 --> 00:21:59.693
See you tomorrow. You hear me?

00:21:59.933 --> 00:22:01.572
See you tomorrow in Yuehai.

00:22:02.213 --> 00:22:03.532
- Heard you.
- Absolutely.

00:22:03.572 --> 00:22:04.173
Tomorrow.

00:22:04.572 --> 00:22:05.092
Yuehai.

00:22:05.133 --> 00:22:05.572
Yuehai.

00:22:05.653 --> 00:22:05.973
Okay.

00:22:05.973 --> 00:22:06.812
See you in Yuehai.

00:22:06.812 --> 00:22:07.653
You must come.

00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:08.413
Absolutely.

00:22:08.693 --> 00:22:09.732
Alright, let's go.

00:22:10.092 --> 00:22:11.052
We'll drink in Yuehai.

00:22:11.373 --> 00:22:11.853
Bye.

00:22:12.732 --> 00:22:13.772
Take it easy.

00:22:13.812 --> 00:22:14.328
Be careful.

00:22:15.012 --> 00:22:15.732
Be careful.

00:22:15.732 --> 00:22:16.653
Hold him.

00:22:17.373 --> 00:22:18.173
Slowly.

00:22:21.812 --> 00:22:23.252
Mr. Zheng, are you okay?

00:22:23.453 --> 00:22:24.173
I'm fine.

00:22:25.133 --> 00:22:25.933
Just a bit dizzy.

00:22:26.252 --> 00:22:27.012
Get me some tea.

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:27.772
Okay.

00:22:30.613 --> 00:22:32.133
Was the money

00:22:32.173 --> 00:22:33.973
enough for the bill earlier?

00:22:34.532 --> 00:22:35.213
I can top it up.

00:22:35.572 --> 00:22:36.732
It's okay. It wasn't much.

00:22:36.812 --> 00:22:37.613
- Forget it.
- No.

00:22:37.693 --> 00:22:38.613
I have to pay you.

00:22:39.133 --> 00:22:39.812
Absolutely.

00:22:40.173 --> 00:22:41.112
We'll settle it later.

00:22:41.973 --> 00:22:42.893
How did I end up

00:22:42.933 --> 00:22:44.812
talking with a full Northeast accent?

00:22:44.933 --> 00:22:47.373
"Absolutely", "no problem".
It all just came out.

00:22:47.373 --> 00:22:49.012
Their way of talking is infectious.

00:22:51.373 --> 00:22:52.772
Those folks from the Northeast...

00:22:53.453 --> 00:22:55.133
Mr. Zheng, why didn't you

00:22:55.252 --> 00:22:56.853
use the towel I handed you?

00:22:58.252 --> 00:22:58.933
I did use it.

00:22:59.413 --> 00:23:01.052
Didn't I wipe the sweat off?

00:23:01.292 --> 00:23:03.613
The towel wasn't for that.

00:23:05.532 --> 00:23:06.532
It was for you

00:23:06.572 --> 00:23:09.092
to spit out the drink
when they weren't looking.

00:23:10.173 --> 00:23:12.653
I can't do that. Don't do that again.

00:23:12.693 --> 00:23:13.336
So embarrassing.

00:23:13.893 --> 00:23:15.012
It's not like I can't drink.

00:23:15.332 --> 00:23:15.942
You...

00:23:15.942 --> 00:23:18.453
It makes you look insincere.

00:23:18.453 --> 00:23:19.133
Don't do that.

00:23:19.173 --> 00:23:21.572
But you shouldn't drink like that.
It's bad for your health.

00:23:21.572 --> 00:23:22.213
Still no.

00:23:22.532 --> 00:23:22.853
Yeah.

00:23:23.292 --> 00:23:24.373
Never do that again.

00:23:25.413 --> 00:23:27.893
Mr. Zheng, you're truly impressive.

00:23:28.732 --> 00:23:30.133
One versus Northeast Five.

00:23:30.213 --> 00:23:31.853
You could really hold your liquor.

00:23:39.732 --> 00:23:41.413
I'll tell you the truth too.

00:23:42.052 --> 00:23:43.693
Listen, I went to

00:23:44.332 --> 00:23:46.572
throw up in the bathroom twice

00:23:47.933 --> 00:23:50.373
and went back to drinking with them.

00:23:50.812 --> 00:23:53.453
There was only one thought in my head.

00:23:53.893 --> 00:23:54.653
I had to

00:23:55.973 --> 00:23:56.693
hang in there.

00:23:57.413 --> 00:23:58.413
I had to make it

00:23:58.973 --> 00:24:00.092
and take them down.

00:24:00.292 --> 00:24:01.492
Yeah, you got them.

00:24:02.092 --> 00:24:03.133
- I did?
- You did.

00:24:03.133 --> 00:24:03.572
Yeah.

00:24:03.653 --> 00:24:04.453
Good to know.

00:24:04.453 --> 00:24:05.012
Here.

00:24:06.213 --> 00:24:06.732
Thank you.

00:24:07.012 --> 00:24:08.092
Thank you.

00:24:09.332 --> 00:24:09.933
Here.

00:24:10.772 --> 00:24:12.092
Have some tea to sober up.

00:24:12.413 --> 00:24:12.853
Here.

00:24:14.332 --> 00:24:14.853
Cheers.

00:24:16.853 --> 00:24:17.373
Bottoms up.

00:24:17.732 --> 00:24:19.252
Okay.

00:24:21.853 --> 00:24:22.693
Hot.

00:24:22.933 --> 00:24:24.853
Blow on it.

00:24:31.012 --> 00:24:32.052
Feeling better?

00:24:32.292 --> 00:24:32.933
Tastes good.

00:24:34.492 --> 00:24:36.693
D-Did he agree to go to Yuehai?

00:24:38.092 --> 00:24:39.133
Yeah, he did.

00:24:39.373 --> 00:24:40.373
That's good.

00:24:43.532 --> 00:24:45.572
If they go to our printery in Yuehai,

00:24:46.453 --> 00:24:48.732
that will be our first step
towards victory.

00:24:49.292 --> 00:24:49.973
Yeah.

00:24:50.613 --> 00:24:52.012
If this really works,

00:24:52.332 --> 00:24:53.572
it will be huge.

This is what a city should look like.

00:25:13.893 --> 00:25:15.064
Towering buildings.

00:25:16.024 --> 00:25:17.133
Wide roads.

Yeah.

00:25:24.213 --> 00:25:25.052

Nice.

00:25:30.413 --> 00:25:31.252
I believe

00:25:32.853 --> 00:25:34.092
that very soon,

00:25:35.332 --> 00:25:36.252
Yuehai

00:25:37.653 --> 00:25:39.532
will look like this, too.

00:25:42.572 --> 00:25:45.332
Yeah, with a Secretary like you,

00:25:46.532 --> 00:25:47.252
it certainly will.

Xie, why are there
only six workers for the opening?

No more questions.

Trust me, honey.

Get it for my opening.

I'm going to change.

00:29:27.133 --> 00:29:28.933
What for? I even forgot your gloves.

00:29:29.332 --> 00:29:30.173
Put them on now.

00:29:30.252 --> 00:29:31.012

00:29:43.252 --> 00:29:44.012
Go back first.

00:30:13.613 --> 00:30:14.213
The light.

So luxurious.

"I got this."

00:30:21.893 --> 00:30:22.893
What does she mean?

00:30:23.092 --> 00:30:24.252
What does she know?

00:30:28.853 --> 00:30:29.653
You got changed.

00:30:29.812 --> 00:30:30.853
It's more elegant.

00:30:31.092 --> 00:30:31.772
You look good.

00:30:32.012 --> 00:30:33.532
Mr. Xie, I've been waiting for you.

00:30:33.613 --> 00:30:34.812
My factory is opening soon.

00:30:35.092 --> 00:30:36.572
The water issue is still pending.

00:30:36.613 --> 00:30:38.052
Still? It's been so long.

00:30:38.133 --> 00:30:38.772
Have a look.

00:30:38.772 --> 00:30:39.413
Please.

00:30:39.413 --> 00:30:40.292
But I'm busy here.

00:30:40.292 --> 00:30:40.653
You...

00:30:40.653 --> 00:30:41.173
I'm busy.

00:30:41.252 --> 00:30:41.772
Please.

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:42.572
- See you.
- Honey.

00:30:42.893 --> 00:30:44.173
Honey. Ms. Li.

00:30:44.413 --> 00:30:45.373
Before 6:00 PM.

00:30:45.373 --> 00:30:46.853
Auspicious.

00:30:47.092 --> 00:30:47.853
Ms. Li.

00:30:49.693 --> 00:30:51.812
Ms. Li, the workers are here.

00:30:52.213 --> 00:30:53.492
Okay, thank you.

00:30:53.772 --> 00:30:54.092
What?

00:30:54.252 --> 00:30:55.853
Ms. Gao, the town government

00:30:56.092 --> 00:30:57.653
is giving you an opening gift.

00:30:58.292 --> 00:31:00.252
We'll install a telephone line for you.

00:31:02.373 --> 00:31:03.613
That's great!

00:31:03.732 --> 00:31:05.133
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:31:05.693 --> 00:31:07.332
I've been waiting day and night,

00:31:07.413 --> 00:31:08.933
and finally, we have a telephone.

00:31:09.373 --> 00:31:10.532
How can I ever thank you?

00:31:10.613 --> 00:31:11.933
You're truly a timely rain,

00:31:12.213 --> 00:31:13.332
a timely rain.

00:31:13.933 --> 00:31:14.532
Where would you

00:31:14.853 --> 00:31:15.973
like the phone installed?

00:31:16.213 --> 00:31:17.613
- Come here.
- Okay.

00:31:17.853 --> 00:31:18.613
I have it in mind.

00:31:18.653 --> 00:31:19.213
Come on.

00:31:19.213 --> 00:31:19.893
Thank you.

00:31:19.893 --> 00:31:20.492
Over here.

00:31:20.853 --> 00:31:22.052
Right here.

00:31:22.252 --> 00:31:23.133
That corner.

00:31:23.853 --> 00:31:24.933
- Alright.
- The little table.

00:31:25.052 --> 00:31:25.332
Okay.

00:31:25.413 --> 00:31:25.933
Okay.

00:31:27.973 --> 00:31:28.653
Ms. Li.

00:31:29.213 --> 00:31:30.373
Thank you so much.

00:31:30.732 --> 00:31:32.572
I've been to the post office
countless times.

00:31:32.572 --> 00:31:34.012
But the lines are endless.

00:31:34.373 --> 00:31:36.252
Only the town government
could get this done.

00:31:37.893 --> 00:31:38.693
Wonderful.

00:31:39.853 --> 00:31:40.373
Sir.

00:31:40.893 --> 00:31:42.492
Ms. Gao, we've checked.

00:31:42.853 --> 00:31:44.853
The wiring needs to come from the back.

00:31:45.173 --> 00:31:46.853
Your house is big. Wiring's tricky.

00:31:47.812 --> 00:31:48.213
So...

00:31:48.492 --> 00:31:50.213
Could you spare some hands to help us?

00:31:50.653 --> 00:31:51.332
No problem.

00:31:51.453 --> 00:31:52.092
Xiaoyu.

00:31:52.492 --> 00:31:53.052
Hurry.

00:31:53.213 --> 00:31:55.092
Find some workers to help run the wires.

00:31:55.772 --> 00:31:56.532
Please follow me.

00:31:56.732 --> 00:31:58.012
Go with her.

00:31:58.292 --> 00:31:58.893
Thank you.

00:32:00.213 --> 00:32:00.772
Sir.

00:32:01.332 --> 00:32:01.853
Over here.

00:32:02.173 --> 00:32:02.693
Okay.

00:32:03.373 --> 00:32:03.933
Come on.

00:32:03.973 --> 00:32:04.332
Sir.

00:32:04.933 --> 00:32:06.413
Just tell me if you need

00:32:06.413 --> 00:32:06.933
more help.

00:32:07.192 --> 00:32:07.832
That's enough.

00:32:08.052 --> 00:32:08.732
Okay.

00:32:08.812 --> 00:32:09.453
Take it slow.

00:32:10.133 --> 00:32:10.812
Be careful.

00:32:10.973 --> 00:32:11.893
Yeah, keep up.

00:32:12.173 --> 00:32:12.693
Keep up.

00:32:13.173 --> 00:32:13.772
Keep up.

00:32:14.853 --> 00:32:15.812
Such a long line

00:32:16.173 --> 00:32:17.012
catches a big fish.

00:32:17.772 --> 00:32:18.933
It's auspicious.

00:32:19.133 --> 00:32:19.613
Come on.

00:32:19.853 --> 00:32:20.613
Easy now.

00:32:20.732 --> 00:32:21.693
Watch your step.

00:32:22.012 --> 00:32:23.012
Slow down.

00:32:23.973 --> 00:32:24.693
Keep up.

00:32:25.653 --> 00:32:26.772
What a long cable.

00:32:27.133 --> 00:32:28.572
It means big business.

00:32:37.772 --> 00:32:38.693
Be careful.

00:32:38.772 --> 00:32:39.532
Okay.

00:32:39.653 --> 00:32:40.213
Ms. Gao,

00:32:41.213 --> 00:32:42.252
you've got many workers.

00:32:42.532 --> 00:32:43.173
Ms. Li.

00:32:43.772 --> 00:32:46.332
We need workers to expand the business.

00:32:46.693 --> 00:32:49.173
Supporting over 20 people isn't easy.

00:32:49.732 --> 00:32:50.373
Oh, Xiaoyu.

00:32:50.893 --> 00:32:52.133
Tell them to make extra dishes.

00:32:52.613 --> 00:32:54.052
- Okay.
- Ms. Li, stay for lunch.

00:32:54.092 --> 00:32:56.092
Our cook makes excellent food.

00:32:56.453 --> 00:32:57.373
I have work to do.

00:32:57.413 --> 00:32:58.092
Next time.

00:32:58.292 --> 00:32:59.933
But it's mealtime, anyway.

00:33:00.332 --> 00:33:00.933
Don't be shy.

00:33:01.572 --> 00:33:02.252
Ms. Gao,

00:33:02.812 --> 00:33:03.492
you said

00:33:03.853 --> 00:33:05.453
you have over 20 workers?

00:33:06.133 --> 00:33:07.292
Of course.

00:33:07.613 --> 00:33:09.532
Paying them all is tough.

00:33:11.532 --> 00:33:12.252
I have to go.

00:33:13.653 --> 00:33:14.772
Are you in a rush?

00:33:15.052 --> 00:33:16.893
- Ms. Li.
- Wait for me.

00:33:17.252 --> 00:33:17.853
Slow down.

00:33:18.252 --> 00:33:18.973
Bye, Ms. Gao.

00:33:19.492 --> 00:33:20.012
Take care.

00:33:20.133 --> 00:33:21.413
Visit often, Ms. Li.

00:33:30.213 --> 00:33:31.332
Qiuping, I found it.

00:33:31.812 --> 00:33:33.133
(Dongjiang Government Document)
This was

00:33:33.332 --> 00:33:34.973
issued on July 7, 1981.

00:33:35.092 --> 00:33:36.332
Turn to Article 5.

00:33:36.653 --> 00:33:38.092
Read me the specifics.

00:33:40.292 --> 00:33:41.368
Self-employed businesses

00:33:41.732 --> 00:33:44.092
are generally operated
by one person or a family.

00:33:44.532 --> 00:33:45.213
When necessary,

00:33:45.572 --> 00:33:47.772
with the approval of the AIC,

00:33:48.173 --> 00:33:50.252
they can hire one or two assistants.

00:33:50.732 --> 00:33:53.532
Businesses with
advanced or special technology

00:33:53.693 --> 00:33:54.812
may take on two to three,

00:33:55.213 --> 00:33:56.772
but no more than five apprentices.

00:33:57.332 --> 00:34:00.332
Contracts must be established
for both assistants and apprentices,

00:34:00.613 --> 00:34:02.373
specifying both parties'
rights, obligations,

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:03.812
term, and compensation.

00:34:04.133 --> 00:34:05.492
Contracts must be certified

00:34:05.572 --> 00:34:08.012
by the local Administration
for Industry and Commerce.

00:34:08.373 --> 00:34:10.132
Zhang, a few newspapers

00:34:10.373 --> 00:34:12.853
had articles related to hiring quotas.

00:34:12.973 --> 00:34:14.012
Could you find them?

00:34:14.453 --> 00:34:15.052
Sure.

00:34:21.373 --> 00:34:23.052
Qiuping, I found them.

00:34:23.572 --> 00:34:24.492
I took a look.

00:34:24.893 --> 00:34:27.000
Those who violated
these employment regulations

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.253
faced serious penalties.

00:34:28.612 --> 00:34:29.933
Some were even arrested.

00:34:30.733 --> 00:34:31.773
That serious?

00:34:35.492 --> 00:34:36.072
Zhang,

00:34:36.472 --> 00:34:38.572
make a few copies of these newspapers.

00:34:39.212 --> 00:34:40.853
Take them to the bus to Yuehai.

00:34:41.933 --> 00:34:43.973
There should be one in about an hour.

00:34:44.293 --> 00:34:45.212
I need them today.

00:34:45.532 --> 00:34:45.973
Okay.

00:34:46.333 --> 00:34:47.492
Thank you very much.

00:34:56.853 --> 00:34:57.532
Mr. Tan.

00:34:59.893 --> 00:35:02.333
Mr. Tan, are you aware of this document?

00:35:06.733 --> 00:35:09.333
No, I've never heard of it.

00:35:09.373 --> 00:35:09.893
What is this?

00:35:10.212 --> 00:35:11.333
It was issued in 1981.

00:35:11.453 --> 00:35:13.813
Policies for non-agricultural
self-employed individuals.

00:35:15.532 --> 00:35:17.733
It sets hiring quotas
for self-employed individuals.

00:35:18.572 --> 00:35:21.132
I went to Gao Xuemei's factory
to install a phone.

00:35:21.413 --> 00:35:23.973
She has over 20 workers there.

00:35:24.212 --> 00:35:25.453
Xie...

00:35:26.572 --> 00:35:27.212
What?

00:35:30.813 --> 00:35:31.733
Xie... I...

00:35:32.733 --> 00:35:33.453
Here's the thing.

00:35:33.532 --> 00:35:35.212
Xie is a deputy mayor.

00:35:35.293 --> 00:35:36.532
So we often remind him,

00:35:36.692 --> 00:35:38.453
"Your wife runs this factory.

00:35:38.492 --> 00:35:40.373
You must be careful
not to violate regulations."

00:35:40.373 --> 00:35:42.052
None of you knew about this?

00:35:42.893 --> 00:35:43.612
We had no idea.

00:35:43.893 --> 00:35:45.092
I didn't know.

00:35:45.172 --> 00:35:46.293
Does Mr. Zheng know?

00:35:47.333 --> 00:35:47.973
Mr. Zheng...

00:35:48.853 --> 00:35:50.212
Mr. Zheng...

00:35:50.612 --> 00:35:51.853
Mr. Zheng.

00:35:52.132 --> 00:35:53.293
If he knew,

00:35:53.333 --> 00:35:55.373
he would have reminded us, right?

00:35:55.453 --> 00:35:57.293
So I figure he didn't know.

00:35:57.733 --> 00:35:58.413
Mr. Tan.

00:35:59.212 --> 00:36:00.532
To be safe,

00:36:01.212 --> 00:36:03.172
we should take immediate measures.

00:36:04.373 --> 00:36:06.092
Well, Ms. Li.

00:36:06.132 --> 00:36:07.893
What measures do you suggest?

00:36:08.212 --> 00:36:09.528
I think we should notify

00:36:09.528 --> 00:36:11.413
Gao Xuemei to suspend all work

00:36:11.773 --> 00:36:14.373
and wait to speak with Mr. Zheng first.

00:36:14.413 --> 00:36:14.933
Yeah.

00:36:15.212 --> 00:36:17.052
But if we shut it down...

00:36:17.253 --> 00:36:18.692
Ms. Li, I think

00:36:18.733 --> 00:36:20.733
you may have to reconsider this issue.

00:36:20.733 --> 00:36:22.132
Because shutting them down

00:36:22.373 --> 00:36:23.733
is not feasible.

00:36:23.813 --> 00:36:24.933
It would be too abrupt

00:36:25.052 --> 00:36:26.733
without a buffer period, right?

00:36:26.733 --> 00:36:27.492
In that case,

00:36:27.692 --> 00:36:28.572
they might...

00:36:28.572 --> 00:36:29.773
Mr. Tan.

00:36:29.973 --> 00:36:30.572
Take it easy.

00:36:31.052 --> 00:36:32.092
You just said

00:36:32.293 --> 00:36:34.052
that Mr. Zheng didn't take action

00:36:34.172 --> 00:36:36.052
because he didn't know
about this document.

00:36:36.253 --> 00:36:38.733
- Yeah.
- But now we do.

00:36:39.052 --> 00:36:41.092
And we know the serious implications.

00:36:41.853 --> 00:36:43.692
We can't just sit back and do nothing.

00:36:43.893 --> 00:36:45.692
We absolutely can't gamble on luck.

00:36:45.893 --> 00:36:47.532
- Right?
- Absolutely not.

00:36:48.612 --> 00:36:49.373
How about this?

00:36:56.933 --> 00:36:57.413
Meng.

00:36:58.612 --> 00:36:59.012
Meng.

00:36:59.132 --> 00:36:59.853
Wait.

00:37:00.692 --> 00:37:01.373
Do me a favor.

00:37:02.333 --> 00:37:03.973
Go to the printery and tell Gao Xuemei

00:37:04.212 --> 00:37:05.132
to suspend operations

00:37:05.212 --> 00:37:06.492
and await further instructions.

00:37:07.212 --> 00:37:08.373
And give her this.

00:37:08.572 --> 00:37:09.532
Tell her it's from me.

00:37:09.813 --> 00:37:10.733
Explain to her.

00:37:11.293 --> 00:37:13.293
I'm doing this for her and Yuehai.

00:37:13.733 --> 00:37:14.253
Got it.

00:37:18.012 --> 00:37:19.452
Meng, where are you going?

00:37:19.452 --> 00:37:20.172
What's the rush?

00:37:20.612 --> 00:37:22.813
Ms. Li sent me to deliver a notice
to Chunmei Printery.

00:37:23.212 --> 00:37:23.933
Let us tag along.

00:37:24.012 --> 00:37:24.652
We need to

00:37:24.692 --> 00:37:25.492
fix our outfits.

00:37:25.692 --> 00:37:26.172
Too big.

00:37:26.612 --> 00:37:27.253
Sure, then.

00:37:29.373 --> 00:37:31.172
Ms. Gao, this order is finished.

00:37:31.212 --> 00:37:32.632
When will we get the next order?

00:37:33.092 --> 00:37:33.773
Listen.

00:37:33.853 --> 00:37:35.212
If we don't get more work soon,

00:37:35.212 --> 00:37:36.373
I'll shut that machine off.

00:37:36.413 --> 00:37:37.572
Watch your step.

00:37:38.092 --> 00:37:39.933
Stack them neatly, or they won't fit.

00:37:41.012 --> 00:37:41.893
Be careful.

00:37:42.413 --> 00:37:43.933
Listen to Mr. Jin.

00:37:43.973 --> 00:37:44.813
Stack them neatly.

00:37:45.333 --> 00:37:47.893
Mom, the phone's ringing.

00:37:48.413 --> 00:37:49.253
Phone call.

00:37:49.532 --> 00:37:50.612
I'll get it.

00:37:51.532 --> 00:37:52.492
Come back. I got this.

00:37:52.733 --> 00:37:54.692
Make sure they stack them neatly.

00:37:58.413 --> 00:37:59.532
Phone call.

00:38:01.132 --> 00:38:01.813
Hello?

00:38:03.373 --> 00:38:04.212
Mr. Zheng.

00:38:04.933 --> 00:38:05.652
Well,

00:38:05.813 --> 00:38:08.092
the phone was just installed
and you're calling already.

00:38:10.453 --> 00:38:11.012
What?

00:38:11.692 --> 00:38:12.333
They're coming?

00:38:13.212 --> 00:38:14.333
Great.

00:38:14.612 --> 00:38:16.092
I happen to have some great liquor

00:38:16.453 --> 00:38:17.092
for them.

00:38:17.652 --> 00:38:18.172
Okay.

00:38:21.092 --> 00:38:21.692
Mr. Jin.

00:38:22.492 --> 00:38:23.773
Mr. Jin, come here.

00:38:23.973 --> 00:38:24.572
Coming.

00:38:25.052 --> 00:38:26.052
Keep the machine running.

00:38:26.293 --> 00:38:27.000
We've got work.

00:38:27.733 --> 00:38:28.773
- Great!
- Right?

00:38:29.052 --> 00:38:30.492
Learn to adjust the equipment

00:38:30.572 --> 00:38:31.933
from your master.

00:38:32.253 --> 00:38:32.853
Teach her.

00:38:33.172 --> 00:38:33.813
Okay.

00:38:34.853 --> 00:38:35.492
- What's wrong?
- Ms. Gao.

00:38:35.652 --> 00:38:37.973
A town government cadre
is looking for you.

00:38:38.253 --> 00:38:38.813
Who is it?

00:38:42.012 --> 00:38:42.453
Ms. Gao.

00:38:42.572 --> 00:38:43.212
Meng.

00:38:43.652 --> 00:38:45.092
Why are you back here? What is it?

00:38:45.572 --> 00:38:46.973
Ms. Li sent me to tell you

00:38:47.253 --> 00:38:48.572
to suspend all your work.

00:38:50.853 --> 00:38:51.773
And she asked me

00:38:52.373 --> 00:38:53.692
to give you this note.

00:38:56.373 --> 00:38:56.973
Suspend work?

00:38:57.212 --> 00:38:58.773
Why? She's shutting us down?

00:38:58.813 --> 00:38:59.933
I don't know why.

00:39:00.453 --> 00:39:02.532
She sent me to inform you.

00:39:02.733 --> 00:39:03.773
Go to work.

00:39:03.813 --> 00:39:05.293
But she's telling us to shut down.

00:39:05.333 --> 00:39:06.293
Get back to work.

00:39:06.453 --> 00:39:08.052
Did Ms. Li say anything else?

00:39:10.933 --> 00:39:13.333
She told me to give you this note.

00:39:14.052 --> 00:39:15.293
And she told me to tell you

00:39:15.612 --> 00:39:17.973
that she's doing it for you and Yuehai.

00:39:20.052 --> 00:39:21.532
Alright, I see.

00:39:21.973 --> 00:39:22.572
Thank you.

00:39:22.652 --> 00:39:23.853
- Is it for real?
- Enough.

00:39:24.504 --> 00:39:26.045
We're suspending all work.

00:39:27.333 --> 00:39:28.172
Enough. Go ahead.

00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:29.012
Go on.

00:39:31.052 --> 00:39:31.544
Go ahead.

00:39:31.893 --> 00:39:32.333
Ms. Gao.

00:39:32.853 --> 00:39:33.253
Ms. Gao.

00:39:34.612 --> 00:39:35.652
When will we resume work?

00:39:35.813 --> 00:39:36.733
Why are we shut down?

00:39:36.773 --> 00:39:38.328
And nothing is

00:39:38.328 --> 00:39:39.132
- for sure.
- Easy.

00:39:39.612 --> 00:39:40.612
Let me explain.

00:39:40.813 --> 00:39:41.172
Yeah.

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:42.652
We need to know.

00:39:42.973 --> 00:39:44.172
What's going on here?

00:39:44.973 --> 00:39:45.813
We need to work.

00:39:45.893 --> 00:39:46.413
Right?

00:39:47.253 --> 00:39:47.773
What's wrong?

00:39:48.132 --> 00:39:48.773
What happened?

00:39:49.373 --> 00:39:50.200
Why did you come in?

00:39:50.692 --> 00:39:51.933
We heard the noise.

00:39:51.973 --> 00:39:52.813
Who are they?

00:39:52.893 --> 00:39:53.492
So many people.

00:39:53.733 --> 00:39:54.293
Who are they?

00:39:54.612 --> 00:39:55.492
What's going on?

00:39:55.532 --> 00:39:56.413
So many people.

00:39:56.453 --> 00:39:57.293
Why did you come in?

00:39:57.293 --> 00:39:57.893
Who are they?

00:39:58.253 --> 00:39:59.413
They're city inspectors.

00:39:59.532 --> 00:40:00.492
The cadres sent

00:40:00.532 --> 00:40:01.532
the city inspectors

00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:02.652
to shut us down.

00:40:03.172 --> 00:40:03.733
Why are you

00:40:03.853 --> 00:40:04.532
shutting us down?

00:40:04.612 --> 00:40:06.212
Get out.

00:40:06.253 --> 00:40:06.773
No.

00:40:07.652 --> 00:40:08.532
Get out.

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:09.652
Get out.

00:40:09.773 --> 00:40:10.373
Calm down.

00:40:11.652 --> 00:40:12.212
Stop it.

00:40:12.733 --> 00:40:13.293
Watch them.

00:40:13.293 --> 00:40:14.172
I'll find Ms. Li

00:40:14.733 --> 00:40:15.692
at the office.

00:40:17.652 --> 00:40:20.052
Mr. Tan, this is serious.

00:40:20.652 --> 00:40:22.453
These are the consequences.

00:40:25.092 --> 00:40:27.052
Mind your conduct.

00:40:28.413 --> 00:40:29.012
Ms. Li.

00:40:30.172 --> 00:40:30.933
Ms. Li.

00:40:31.532 --> 00:40:32.212
It's bad.

00:40:33.253 --> 00:40:35.052
They're fighting at the printery.

00:40:35.373 --> 00:40:36.333
They're fighting?

00:40:38.092 --> 00:40:38.692
Ms. Li.

00:40:40.333 --> 00:40:41.212
What happened?

00:40:42.652 --> 00:40:43.293
Nothing.

00:40:44.088 --> 00:40:44.733
What happened?

00:40:44.733 --> 00:40:45.373
Let's go see.

00:40:45.413 --> 00:40:46.253
Let's go.

00:40:49.492 --> 00:40:49.933
Mr. Zheng.

00:40:51.052 --> 00:40:51.453
Well...

00:40:52.413 --> 00:40:53.092
I hope

00:40:53.492 --> 00:40:55.373
your factory's production

00:40:56.092 --> 00:40:57.373
matches your drinking capacity.

00:40:59.652 --> 00:41:00.733
Rest assured.

00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:03.132
Even though Yuehai is newly built,

00:41:03.692 --> 00:41:06.172
we use top-notch machinery.

00:41:06.612 --> 00:41:07.212
That is...

00:41:18.973 --> 00:41:21.012
Is this seasickness or drunkenness?

00:41:21.293 --> 00:41:22.092
Seasickness.

00:41:22.733 --> 00:41:24.172
Definitely seasickness.

00:41:24.453 --> 00:41:25.933
You know how much Mr. Zheng drinks.

00:41:25.933 --> 00:41:26.532
Yeah.

00:41:26.572 --> 00:41:27.692
Mr. Zheng meant to say

00:41:27.773 --> 00:41:30.172
that our printing machines
are the latest model.

00:41:30.692 --> 00:41:31.453
The latest.

00:41:31.773 --> 00:41:33.092
You know what?

00:41:33.652 --> 00:41:35.172
The price matters the most.

00:41:43.893 --> 00:41:45.453
Why are you fighting?

00:41:46.212 --> 00:41:47.092
Stop it.

00:41:47.453 --> 00:41:48.132
Calm down.

00:41:48.373 --> 00:41:49.092
Let's talk.

00:41:49.132 --> 00:41:49.572
Stop it.

00:41:49.773 --> 00:41:50.492
Let's talk.

00:41:51.373 --> 00:41:51.733
You...

00:41:51.813 --> 00:41:52.413
Come on.

00:41:52.532 --> 00:41:53.652
Come on. Hurry.

00:41:53.893 --> 00:41:54.453
Calm down.

00:41:56.733 --> 00:41:57.492
Stop it.

00:41:58.172 --> 00:41:58.733
Come on.

00:41:58.733 --> 00:41:59.853
Calm down. Okay?

00:42:00.092 --> 00:42:00.692
Let's talk.

00:42:00.813 --> 00:42:01.293
Step aside.

00:42:01.293 --> 00:42:02.253
- Step back.
- Make way.

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:04.453
- What's going on, Ms. Li?
- Ms. Gao.

00:42:04.853 --> 00:42:06.733
Did you really send them
to shut us down?

00:42:06.773 --> 00:42:08.012
Did you get the note?

00:42:08.132 --> 00:42:08.733
What?

00:42:09.132 --> 00:42:11.172
Your factory must pause operations.

00:42:11.572 --> 00:42:12.532
On what grounds?

00:42:13.172 --> 00:42:14.933
You're such a pretty young lady.

00:42:14.973 --> 00:42:16.293
But this isn't a pretty move.

00:42:16.692 --> 00:42:17.333
What happened?

00:42:17.453 --> 00:42:18.172
How did it happen?

00:42:18.413 --> 00:42:19.933
We wanted to fix our clothes.

00:42:20.052 --> 00:42:21.373
Then they started fighting.

00:42:21.413 --> 00:42:22.253
We went in

00:42:22.453 --> 00:42:24.052
and they attacked us.

00:42:24.092 --> 00:42:24.733
Seriously?

00:42:26.132 --> 00:42:26.572
And you.

00:42:27.333 --> 00:42:28.373
Why did you bring them?

00:42:28.532 --> 00:42:29.733
I heard there was a fight.

00:42:29.773 --> 00:42:31.132
So I brought some people.

00:42:31.172 --> 00:42:32.132
That's unnecessary.

00:42:32.813 --> 00:42:34.212
What a total mess.

00:42:36.813 --> 00:42:37.333
Xie.

00:42:38.692 --> 00:42:39.172
Xie.

00:42:39.933 --> 00:42:40.893
Xie.

00:42:41.253 --> 00:42:42.172
You're finally back.

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:43.853
This is serious.

00:42:44.572 --> 00:42:45.092
Look.

00:42:45.132 --> 00:42:46.212
They heard about the fight.

00:42:46.212 --> 00:42:47.052
Take a look.

00:42:47.092 --> 00:42:49.132
Ms. Li brought all these people

00:42:49.492 --> 00:42:50.172
to shut us down.

00:42:50.172 --> 00:42:50.692
Your eye.

00:42:50.893 --> 00:42:51.492
What about it?

00:42:51.733 --> 00:42:52.212
It's red.

00:42:52.413 --> 00:42:52.973
Red?
