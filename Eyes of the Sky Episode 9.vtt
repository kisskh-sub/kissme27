WEBVTT

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.479
It's completely hopeless now.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.039
You are the murderer who killed President Bai.

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:55.679
President Bai's glorious reputation...

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.840
...has ended in your hands just like that.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.799
Butler, call the police.

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:00.479
Call the police! Arrest him!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.920
Didn't you say you could save my dad?

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:07.599
Dad!

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.400
It's been hard on you lately.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.599
Not at all. Sisi did it willingly.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.799
Little Cang, any problems?

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:27.319
Master, no problems.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:34.480
Dad.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.959
I haven't left yet, and you're already panicking?

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.400
Dad!

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:46.920
Dad, you're awake!

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.079
This is simply impossible.

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:50.879
How is it possible to use the naked eye...

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:52.799
...to perform nano-level operations?

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.480
How did he do that?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.000
What is going on?

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.040
How did the chip restart?

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:04.480
Young man, thank you for saving me.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.319
Tell me, what reward do you want?

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.879
President Bai, I don't want anything.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.199
That you are alive...

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.759
...is the greatest benefit to Cloud Intelligence Tech.

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.479
So you're from Cloud Intelligence Tech.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.080
Since you saved me...

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.039
...I'll add another 300 million to the investment.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.080
Then I thank you on behalf of President Lin.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.199
So he is Huo Ming.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.000
So you're the Huo Ming my daughter likes.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.680
She's always talking about you in front of me.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.360
Dad!

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.120
My ears are callused from hearing about it.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.840
Why are you bringing this up now?

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.960
Very good. I've decided you're my son-in-law.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.840
My great benefactor, thank you.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.599
I...

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.319
You ungrateful traitor.

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.960
Gather all the data from just now immediately.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.000
Call the police.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.800
I was wrong! I was wrong!

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:58.599
Please, spare me!

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.919
Little Cang.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.840
Help me check what the problem really is.

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.199
Master.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.960
According to the image analysis just now...

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.360
...someone tampered with it.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.759
They remotely controlled the chip...

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.360
...and turned off the pacemaker.

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.120
Who could it be?

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.000
Back-tracing now.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.199
Found it.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.000
It really is President Du behind this.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.479
Why am I not surprised at all?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.639
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.159
How did you hack into my computer?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.599
You should thank me.

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.159
If I had been ten minutes later...

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.360
...and something happened to old man Bai...

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.960
...you would be guilty of premeditated murder.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.759
Do you understand?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.479
Jerk.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.479
Didn't you take care of it?

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.680
I did everything exactly as you ordered.

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.000
He can still turn the tables in this situation?

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.280
Get out!

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.439
The wealthy son-in-law is back to work.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.199
You really have time on your hands.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.319
I went there to help you.

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:12.560
Are you jealous?

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:15.879
Who's jealous?

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.240
I'm just asking you...

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.360
...if you really became the Bai family's son-in-law...

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.279
...can Bai Xinhui charge you?

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:29.160
You like me.

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:32.879
If you like me, just admit it.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:33.920
What's the big deal?

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.160
We're all adults here.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.079
I like you too.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.800
Who are you fooling?

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.879
You just want to get charged, don't you?

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:44.600
That's right. Charging.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.399
Yun.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:56.879
I'm back.

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:26.759
Make way.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.920
Chu Chen.

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:34.240
When the princess is in trouble,

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:35.920
I, as her guardian knight,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.680
must naturally return to your side to protect you.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.240
Who is this guy?

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.079
He talks like he's in a stage play.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.879
That's President Chu Chen.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.439
President Lin's college classmate.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.800
Back then, they were a perfect match.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.040
A match made in heaven.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.040
Lin Yun actually looks so happy to see this guy.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.839
She's even tucking her hair.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.120
He came back this time to propose to President Lin.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.240
Propose?

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.199
That's right.

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:04.160
Three years ago, when the institute had that accident,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.360
and the company nearly went under,

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.240
it was President Chu Chen who saved it.

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:10.600
This company is the fruit of their love.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.439
What fruit?

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:16.560
Staying makes it a fruit of love.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.680
Leaving makes it a kidney stone of love, got it?

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:23.639
Mr. Huo, right?

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.000
You look unfamiliar.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.439
But that doesn't matter.

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:30.079
Thank you for helping Xiao Yun guard the company for me.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.720
You're welcome.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.399
I am a shareholder of the company myself.

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:40.720
The two of us happen to have some business.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.360
If you're not busy, you can leave now.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.319
I heard you're a delivery driver, Mr. Huo.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.199
Something like finding Cang Qiong...

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:53.399
is better left to...

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:55.160
professionals like me.

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:57.199
Fine. Let's have a contest then.

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.199
See who finds it first.

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:02.399
Do you know why you can't find it?

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:04.600
Because Cang Qiong was disassembled

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.920
and hidden in the database.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.199
It was broken down into parts.

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:10.959
The disassembled data possesses camouflage properties.

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:12.879
Ordinary people can't trace it at all.

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:14.079
He's actually showing off.

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:16.800
Xiao Cang, search for some pretentious lines for me.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.160
Okay.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.399
What level of pretentiousness, Master?

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:19.759
Max effect. Super pretentious.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.759
The more pretentious, the better.

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:22.439
Here it comes.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.360
That's right.

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:26.680
The disassembled Cang Qiong

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.279
indeed possesses camouflage properties.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.399
It is just like...

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.959
the observer paradox in quantum entanglement theory.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.800
The act of observation itself is problematic.

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:36.639
Just like Schrödinger's cat in the box.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.839
What is most important for us now

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:39.360
is to identify the anomalous data,

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:40.720
and then reassemble the parts into a whole.

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:50.360
Half each. Can you handle it?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.040
I'll give you a handicap.

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:55.079
Not bad at all.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.959
Your skills are pretty good.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.199
Almost catching up to my level in college.

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:03.279
You're not bad either.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.279
You've forced me to use half my hand speed.

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:08.120
Hand speed is useless.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.360
The method you are using

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.720
is one I discarded ten years ago.

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:13.879
My effective operation rate is 100%.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:14.360
Worry about yourself.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.560
With such fast hand speed,

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:16.560
call me "Daddy" when you lose later.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.439
Surprisingly, there are no wasted movements.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.079
Your skills had better be as tough as your talk.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.800
Or I'll look rude for bullying a moron.

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:34.720
The data has all been copied to the hard drive.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:37.960
Great.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.600
I didn't expect Cang Qiong, which we've sought for three years,

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:42.279
to have been hiding in the company all along.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.279
This is our company's

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:51.919
only remaining lab core chip.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.440
It can activate Cang Qiong.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.840
A password is required.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.320
It's actually this kind of encryption technology.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.600
This is the highest level,

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.320
Hydesville-Aipulos data password.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.759
It requires the passwords held separately

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.879
by seven researchers to crack.

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:15.720
With the aid of artificial intelligence now,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.279
cracking passwords isn't hard.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.519
Each researcher holds a password of six to thirty characters.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.519
A minimum of forty-two characters,

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:23.840
and a maximum of two hundred and ten.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.279
And it's a combination of numbers and case-sensitive letters.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.200
Each character has sixty-two possibilities.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.200
That's sixty-two to the one hundred seventieth power,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.200
combined with the sequence from forty-two

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.759
to two hundred and ten characters.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.120
This number approaches infinity.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.399
It cannot be cracked.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.399
You just rattled off a whole bunch of gibberish.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.639
Can you speak human language?

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.679
I am speaking language humans can understand.

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:49.440
What do you mean?

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.600
Cang Qiong has been activated.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.120
If the correct password isn't entered within three days,

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.519
the self-destruct program will initiate.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.679
Countdown: seventy-two hours.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.559
We have to find the researchers' passwords in three days.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.519
That's just too hard.

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:14.120
Mind-Bender has the memories of four researchers.

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:16.120
He should have four passwords.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.519
You must catch him.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.200
How do we catch him?

00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:21.519
Lin Yun.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.919
Fu Xue has agreed to be the bait.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.519
I will deliberately spread the news

00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:27.080
that she has already obtained Cang Qiong.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.919
You went to great lengths to lure me here,

00:11:20.919 --> 00:11:22.559
only to use such a cheap trick.

00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:23.960
Don't be in such a hurry.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.279
There's a surprise waiting for you.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.120
I've always felt there was something wrong with your helmet.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.080
Today, I'm giving you a little gift.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.159
What do you mean?

00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:36.360
Let's see if you can withstand electromagnetic interference.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.679
How are you feeling today?

00:12:14.679 --> 00:12:15.399
I'm okay.

00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:18.000
I've pretended to lose him as planned.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.480
He's heading back now.

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:20.440
Get ready.

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:22.440
Okay, got it.

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:33.279
Tell me the Cang Qiong password.

00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:35.679
I don't know any Cang Qiong password.

00:12:35.799 --> 00:12:36.600
You won't talk?

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.240
If you won't talk, I'll take it myself.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.639
Let me see your true face.
