00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.680
(Seo Hyun Jin)

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.780
(Yoo Jae Myung)

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.990
(Lee Si Woo)

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.030
(Yoon Se A)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.440
(Chang Ryul)

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.410
(Dahyun)

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.020
(Love Me)

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.010
Gosh, you scared me!

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.310
What? You slept here?

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.250
I'm sorry.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.250
Don't stay out late drinking with the undergrads. Got it?

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.850
You're 30 now. Stop acting like a kid.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.590
Anyway, where'd it go? Have you seen a red USB?

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.660
- Sorry? - The red USB.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.600
Gosh, I'm running out of time. Just find that USB for me.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.700
Yes, sir.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.040
When you have a moment, clean up, will you? This place is a mess.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.840
Isn't it about time you got your act together?

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.240
Professor.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.080
Yes?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.050
Do you remember what you once told me?

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.090
What? What did I say?

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.060
You asked if I even cared about my own life.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.300
That I was just getting in my own way.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.600
Did I? That was harsh. Sorry.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.500
Professor, I...

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.540
I don't want to get in my own way anymore.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.650
I'm much more invested in my life now.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.710
Hey.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.950
Me? Same as always. How have you been?

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.160
I'm sorry?

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.190
I feel perfectly fine, but they're telling me it's cancer.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.360
But you seem perfectly fine.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.070
Tell me about it.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.270
Ignorance is bliss, I guess.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.370
And knowing is the real illness.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.410
- Hey. - I don't even feel it's unfair.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.640
I mean, look at my age,

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.080
and all the drinking and smoking I've done.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.950
- Here, have some of this. - You shouldn't have.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.990
Here, honey, you eat this.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.490
Aren't you cold, honey?

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.390
Cold? Dressed like this? Of course not.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.460
We can't have you catching a cold.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.030
- I'll go get you a blanket. - Here, wear this.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.970
- Wear it. - I'm hot.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.010
I'll be right back.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.650
My youngest got a job, so my kids are giving me a generous allowance.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.150
I was all set to travel everywhere with my wife,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.060
but then I had to go and get stupidly sick.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.790
Last year, when we were planning a trip,

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.400
my wife suggested we use her mileage to fly business class for once.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.670
I regret telling her to save it, thinking it was a waste.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.300
You can just get better and fly then.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.070
You think I'll ever get to use that mileage?

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.470
Of course.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.610
- You have to. Of course you will. - Don't talk like that.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:06.810
You're right.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.550
I'll get better and travel everywhere. Leave no regrets.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.130
This might sound strange,

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.660
but I'm not as worried about the person who's sick...

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.600
as I am for the loved one who has to watch them.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.840
Still, they're both so optimistic,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.710
so I'm sure they'll get through this.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.420
I heard someone had this engraved on their tombstone.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.020
"I dithered and dallied,"

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.320
"and I knew this is how it would end."

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.430
Even though I swore I wouldn't live like that,

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.400
I was indecisive all over again,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.670
and I dithered again.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.840
I'm going to live my own life,

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.140
and my kids will live theirs.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.310
I'm going to fight doggedly to be happy.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.190
Father, are you looking for something?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.960
Where's our tent?

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.360
- The tent? - Yes.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.370
The one we use for the retreats.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.440
If only things had worked out with Jun Kyung,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.640
I wouldn't have just stood by as your brother-in-law.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.180
Thank me for becoming a priest. It saved your neck.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.450
Anyway, thanks.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.990
Get this back before the summer retreat.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.290
I don't know if you'll even make it that long.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.860
I'm sure I'll have it back by then.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.730
I'll get it back to you.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.000
I'll get it back to you. Okay?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.170
Mr. Seo is worried enough as it is.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.370
I'm starting to think I'm making a mistake.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.210
Hey, you absolutely cannot tell my dad about this.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.280
This is as sacred as a confession.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.520
It's a promise with the guy who was almost your brother-in-law.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.520
Come on.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.120
That's it.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.660
Don't you dare say a word.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.600
Swear to God.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.110
I came back for you.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.140
To give us another shot.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.730
Don't you think this might be too much for her?

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.430
I've yet to meet a woman who thinks a diamond is "too much."

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.570
Usually, it's the men who find them to be too much.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.570
The woman who receives this will be very happy, I'm sure.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.870
A man's sincerity is what makes a woman truly happy.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.240
And the sincerity of a successful man...

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.610
makes a woman even happier.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.920
What did I do that was so wrong?

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.560
I worked my fingers to the bone, did all the legwork myself...

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.000
to buy this house. And now I want to sell it...

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.830
to find my own happiness.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.670
Do I deserve to be treated like this for that?

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.040
What's weighing on your mind?

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.180
You tend to walk when you're lost in thought.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.820
But walking all the way home seems a bit extreme, right?

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.120
Jun Kyung, please, get in.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.720
I'm sorry.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.500
I don't get my dad, who'd sell his own house on a whim.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.240
And I don't get Jun Seo's tantrum when it's not even his house.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.040
They're not kids, so why are they acting like this? Seriously.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.810
I think I can kind of see where they're coming from.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.280
And where is all this compassion coming from?

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.390
It's not just understanding. To be honest, I'm actually envious.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.060
- Envious of what? - Your father.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.090
To be so bold for the person he loves...

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.730
to be able to make a decision like that.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.770
I think that's pretty admirable.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.970
You don't find many men like that.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.900
But he's not just a man. He's also a father.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.440
You've moved out,

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.180
and Jun Seo is barely home between school and his dating life.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.320
Since your father's home all alone, I see why he might feel that way.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.050
Then she could just move in and live with him.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.250
Do you think she'd be comfortable? Jun Seo wouldn't be, either.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.400
What is it?

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.030
This is what I love about you, Do Hyun.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.680
Being a father, being a man...

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.850
I'm not doing a great job myself. It's so complicated.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.050
It is.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.560
I moved out a long time ago,

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.460
and I thought the house didn't mean much to me anymore.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.230
But the thought of it suddenly being gone...

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.770
It just feels strange.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.340
You've kept this place in great shape.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.280
For its age, the floors, the molding...

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.610
There's nothing that needs work.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.720
It's move-in ready as is.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320
Is that right?

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.090
This is my first time selling a house.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.030
I'm envious, sir. At least you have a house to sell.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.100
I don't even have one of those yet.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.300
No, not like that.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.900
Draw a straight line from here, got it?

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.480
It'll look more spacious that way. Gosh, I've already told you.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.310
How long do you think it'll take to sell?

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.110
Oh, right.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.750
You'd be surprised how many people want a house with a yard.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.990
It's great for raising kids, great for dogs.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.760
A place like this could get an offer by tomorrow.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:35.960
And the photos and video we took today...

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.230
will be up on our blog by the end of the day.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.460
Really? That soon?

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.270
In this day and age, you have to be fast to survive.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.310
Get a shot of that side. Yes, from over there.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.810
Is it a sure thing?

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:54.610
The instructor position?

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.720
It's not set in stone yet.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.850
But he promised he'd give me a strong recommendation.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.790
Because he trusts me.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.590
The guy who still lacks credits to graduate?

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.360
What's there to trust?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.030
Your patience and perseverance?

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.270
Right. I guess that's a talent in itself.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.980
You gave your dad such a hard time for selling the house secretly,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.910
and now you're setting up camp here without asking me?

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.480
I just thought we could share some of this extra space.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.950
Maybe share some of your food while we're at it.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.820
And I'll only use the bathroom when you're not in it.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.730
Once I'm an instructor,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.800
even if you cry and beg me to stay, I'll get my own place and move out.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.170
Don't you worry about a thing.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.030
Oh, gosh.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.840
But...

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.710
did you actually want to be an instructor?

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.710
As of today, I have been reborn...

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.250
as a man destined to become an instructor.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.190
You know why?

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.720
I have to get even with my dad and sister for this humiliation.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.200
You cannot tell them I'm here. Got it?

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:21.930
Promise?

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.000
(Ji Hye On)

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.770
Jun Kyung, Jun Seo is at my place.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.670
I figured you and your dad would be worried.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.680
I know.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.150
How did you know?

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.380
The priest told me.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.150
Chang Sik did?

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.090
How would he know?

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.290
I'm done worrying about him. He can take care of himself.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.490
Like you said, he's not a kid anymore.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.330
And...

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.530
I listed the house.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.800
Just so you know.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.770
Okay.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.650
- Hello, sir. - Oh, yes. Come on in.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.120
- Right this way. - Thank you. Excuse us.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.650
- Hello. - Hi.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.090
Sir, we'll start with the back rooms.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.490
- Yes, of course. Take your time. - Right.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.930
Come this way, please.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.410
Here, please have a drink while you look around.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.010
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.080
It's a lot more dated than it looked in the video.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.980
It's pretty old-fashioned, isn't it?

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.950
When we redo the wallpaper and flooring,

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.450
we'll have to replace all the doors too.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.590
You'll definitely want to do that.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.330
Judging by your fashion, you two have great taste,

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.100
so I'm sure you'll do wonders with this place.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.200
The living room seems a bit small for the square footage.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.300
But you said you needed a nursery and one other room,

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.570
you could just knock down this wall here.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:52.510
Knock down a wall?

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.350
Is that structurally sound?

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.880
Of course! Older houses are sturdy. This thing's a tank.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.080
You could open the whole place up.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:07.790
Won't it get really buggy in the summer?

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:12.060
We don't really need a garden. What if we put a deck here instead?

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.360
Exactly! You can add a nice big deck out here,

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.700
add a parasol, and have your own private cafe.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.210
Hey!

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.740
Look, if you don't like the house, don't buy it.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.280
What right do you have to talk about tearing it apart?

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.380
- What is all this nonsense? - Sir.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.350
They're just saying that because they want to make it theirs.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.780
This guy's unbelievable.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.920
You think I'm unbelievable?

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.320
What's so unbelievable about me?

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.120
From where I'm standing, you're the unbelievable ones.

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:40.890
This isn't just any house.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.260
I'm not selling! Now get out.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:44.860
Sir, I believe there's been a misunderstanding.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.530
You're the worst of them all! I ought to...

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:48.770
You said it was move-in ready.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.700
Get out! I'm not selling to you, so get out!

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.170
- Get out! Get out now! - Sir, please!

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.240
Get out of my house!

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.340
- Sir? - Yes.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.380
I think they're interested. I'll give you a call.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.250
All right.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.680
- Okay. - We should go.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.050
Thank you for your time.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.090
About the other day...

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.900
My mom was rude to you, wasn't she?

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.270
No, of course not.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.840
She must have been.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:31.910
But still,

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.380
please don't hate my mom too much.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.450
I don't.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.220
Now that I'm leaving, you don't have to walk on eggshells.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.190
You can sleep over at my dad's house now.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.560
It sounds like we're never going to see each other again.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.660
Why wouldn't we see each other?

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.470
Ms. Seo, if you...

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.340
and Dad break up,

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.840
would you stop seeing me?

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.010
What?

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.210
No, I just mean...

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.580
You never know what might happen.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.610
I don't mean you two should break up, though.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:12.980
My dad...

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.060
is a pretty great guy.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:19.890
Gosh.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:25.630
Gosh, your Korean is so good now. You've become a smooth talker.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.840
There we go.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.920
You brought your fish?

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.020
Yes.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:51.920
Why? Is that a problem?

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.260
No, of course not. Let's go in.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.970
I'm going to take off.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:11.010
- Get settled. - What? You expect us to carry this?

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.040
It's not that much.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.450
You don't have a recording today, do you?

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.550
It's not like you're intruding. Stay and have dinner.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.690
I made that curry you love. I went all out today.

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:26.190
I have plans to meet Jun Kyung.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.770
Fine. Maybe some other time, then. I'm not trying to rush you.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.970
We'll have to see each other for Daniel's sake, anyway.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:41.910
I can wait.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.140
I've got to go.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.480
Hey, Jun Seo.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.110
Working late again?

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.810
Gosh, that sounds rough.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.080
All right, make sure you get something to eat.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.420
Okay.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.230
When I was a kid,

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.960
right around this time,

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.700
my mom would bring in the laundry...

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.970
and fold it on the living room floor.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.770
And every time, I'd be right there next to her, helping her fold.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.710
Even though I did a terrible, crooked job of it,

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.780
my mom would say, "You're such a good boy, Jun Seo."

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.450
"You're doing such a good job."

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:43.250
And while we were doing that,

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.660
my sister would get home from school.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.390
Then a little while later,

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.560
my dad would come home from work,

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.070
and then we'd all have dinner together,

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.770
and have my mom's favourite ice cream for dessert.

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:05.240
That's a sweet memory.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.180
We were so happy back then.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:25.960
Hello?

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.230
Jun Kyung.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.100
Are you done already?

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:35.210
- You must be sad to see Daniel go. - I am.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:37.870
Now when I get home, Daniel will be gone,

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:40.410
and Oscar will be gone too.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.650
The only thing moving in that house will be the robot vacuum.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.520
I think I might move out.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.060
My lease is almost up anyway,

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.860
so I should probably move to a place...

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.560
that's better suited for one person.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.000
Where are you, Jun Kyung?

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.010
I'm at my dad's house, but nobody's home.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.440
What are you doing there all by yourself?

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.280
Just...

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:18.720
sitting here.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.620
Being here all alone,

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.630
I'm starting to understand my dad, just like you said I would.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:35.270
Now I don't think I could say a word if he decides to sell the house.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.100
Jun Kyung.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.270
Yes?

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.810
Do you want to move in together?

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.520
Those people were way out of line.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.350
Who badmouths a house like that right in front of the owner?

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:58.390
I'm offended just listening to it.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.830
It's a house the owner doesn't value enough to keep.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.200
Why would anyone else speak highly of it?

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:11.070
Even getting rid of Bom's little doghouse,

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.340
I felt so strange, as if our memories of Bom were fading.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.180
For both you and me, Jin Ho,

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:24.680
it's not that we don't cherish this place.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.190
Hold on a second.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:38.730
Hello?

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.469
(Seo Jun Kyung)

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:45.470
What?

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.410
You scared me!

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.250
Why didn't you answer my call?

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.250
What? How did you know I was here?

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.820
Is your location a state secret or something?

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:02.650
What?

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.120
Seriously, you can't trust anyone.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.360
- It's a secret to Dad. - Dad already knows.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:12.600
You told him?

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.200
What part of "already knows" did you not understand?

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.970
Gosh, Chang Sik.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.910
For a priest, he sure has a big mouth.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:24.710
Just get out of here.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.840
Where are we going?

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.450
You have to tell me.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.780
Isn't Do Hyun's idea brilliant?

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.760
If Do Hyun and I both end our leases and move into this house,

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.220
we wouldn't have to sell the house,

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.430
Dad could run the camp with Ms. Jin, and Jun Seo could stay in his room.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.000
No way.

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.730
- Why would I mooch off of you? - You stubborn little punk.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.070
This time, I'm determined to move out on my own.

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:56.170
Knock it off. Stop being a burden to Hye On.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:01.240
He's not a burden at all. I feel a lot safer with him here.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:04.310
Not really, but...

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.720
He's like my own personal bodyguard, minus the salary.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.590
I'm fine with it.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.130
What do you think, Ms. Jin?

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.500
Do I get a say in this?

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.330
Of course.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:26.270
I'd be happy enough just not having to sell the house.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.500
Right?

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.810
But are you really sure you're okay with this?

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.610
I know you're wearing rose-coloured glasses now,

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.910
but they're going to come off eventually.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.620
What will you do about this house you're now financially tied to?

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:41.450
I'd love that. If the house means we can never break up.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.500
What about you, Dad?

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.880
Dad.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:09.750
I...

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:18.450
You're all being so...

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.530
What's wrong? Is he still sulking?

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.170
He's acting like such a kid.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.440
One more word out of you and I'll sew your mouth shut.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.580
What's wrong, Dad?

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.360
In this house...

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.570
It's not just my history that lives here.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.340
Your history is here,

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:11.140
Jun Seo's history is here,

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.840
and your mother, Kim Mi Ran's, history is all here too.

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.680
I've been so selfish and pathetic.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.520
I'm too ashamed to even look at you two.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.030
That's not true.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.040
The first day we moved into this house,

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:44.440
I couldn't sleep. "Did we deserve to live in such a nice place?"

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.210
Especially since we were just renting.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:49.680
Mom really loved this house.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.220
Your mom and I loved this house so much...

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.820
that we went from renting to putting down a large deposit,

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.390
to eventually making it our own.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.760
That night, the two of us just bawled our eyes out.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:13.500
Through all that, your mom was so frugal.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:16.610
She must have gone through so much.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.940
We had Jun Seo here,

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:21.810
we raised you,

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.780
and she took care of me.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.620
Jun Kyung.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:36.560
Your mom, up in the skies,

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.560
must be really cursing me out, right?

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:42.830
Knowing Mom? You think she wouldn't have?

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:54.640
Your mom and I had you, Jun Kyung, when we were 20.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:56.610
What did we know back then?

00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:59.980
We were just kids having a kid.

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:09.390
- It might seem like we raised you. - Honey.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:12.030
But you were the one who made us parents.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.229
- What time is it? - And made us...

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:15.300
- into adults. - It's 5am.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.370
Here in this house,

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:21.970
you and I...

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:25.210
- This way. - grew up together.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.180
There.

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:32.420
Jun Kyung. Do you remember that time?

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.620
- Remember what? - That time you and I...

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:37.590
looked up at the sky together from right here.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.630
Dad, where are we going?

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.000
Jun Kyung, you're awake?

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:51.630
It's the Lunar New Year. We have to go to Grandma's.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.310
- Dad. - Yes?

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.940
Why is the sky this colour?

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:05.920
This is what they call "dawn."

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:11.620
- Dawn? - Yes. First time seeing the dawn?

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.490
It's pretty, isn't it?

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:15.490
It's so pretty.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:18.730
- Dad. - Yes?

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.630
Thank you for showing me the dawn.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.800
Right.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:26.500
Sure.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.840
Jin Ho, we're going to be late. Come on!

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.280
Okay, I'm coming!

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.880
- Let's go. - You're awake, Jin Kyung?

00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:37.010
You must be cold.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.490
- Dad, isn't that heavy? - I'm fine.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.630
- Is that yours? - What, the bag?

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.130
- The bag. - Yeah, it's mine.

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:57.800
Ja Yeong, the one on top.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:11.609
- Come on in. - Okay.

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.480
- That looks heavy. - I'm fine.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:21.190
- Jun Kyung. - Yes, Dad?

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.730
I left Mom's things as they were, like you said.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.300
Right. We'll just use my room.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.770
The master and Jun Seo's rooms will be left as is.

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:37.270
All right, then.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.490
All right.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.630
- Okay, everyone. - Yes.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.459
- Let's all keep in touch. - Okay.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:58.730
And see each other often.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.960
Anyway, let's all take care of ourselves...

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.570
and live well.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.569
- Okay. You too, Dad. - You too, Dad.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:06.270
- Come visit us at the campground. - Okay, we will.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.340
I'll be sure to stop by.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:09.270
- I'm heading out. - Okay. Drive safe.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:10.910
- Okay, I'm really leaving now. - Bye.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:13.410
- Drive safe. - Dad, drive carefully.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.480
Okay.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.150
- We should get going too. - Right. What should I do now?

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.390
Just say goodbye. And don't be a burden to Hye On.

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:27.420
- Jun Kyung, don't you hurt him. - Whatever.

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.560
I'm heading out. See you guys.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.730
I told you I'm going first.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:39.340
What on earth did you pack in here?

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:43.410
What is this?

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:51.010
Thank you so much.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.190
I could have carried that, you know.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.420
Seriously.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.660
This thing...

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.870
Hey, this isn't bad.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.280
Ja Yeong.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.950
- Yes? - Come here a second. Quick.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.820
- Why? - Hurry.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.920
- Why? What's going on? - Hurry!

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:32.920
- Quick! Something amazing. Hurry! - What's going on? What is it?

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:34.220
- Look. - What?

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.430
Where's the circle part?

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.830
I thought you said the Northern Crown was a circle.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.700
I must have forgotten to mention something.

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.070
You can only see it if you're a good person.

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:54.810
Finally, we're done.

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:57.380
What a relief.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:04.450
That was a lot of work, right?

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.430
In this stately old house,

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.560
sitting out on the deck,

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:20.140
don't we feel like an old married couple?

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.900
An old married couple?

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:23.270
Yes.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:25.980
Who never really argued,

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.980
and lived happily in this house for...

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:32.880
about 30 or 40 years?

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.990
A sweet, old couple like that.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.990
How about...

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:44.790
a nice, cold beer?

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.100
I'm in.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.430
Lots of ice, please.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.600
You got it.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:13.190
Let's eat.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.160
You're really digging in.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:25.740
If you want to go to your dad's, just let me know.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.270
I'll take you.

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.170
It'd be a little weird for me to go to Dad's now.

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:33.910
I can take a hint, you know.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.480
Why?

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.510
What?

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:50.230
Dad is living with Jun Kyung.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.030
Didn't Dad tell you?

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:00.670
I should get some coffee.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:03.370
Hey, the coffee in our breakroom is actually good.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.880
If it's so great, why'd you quit the hospital?

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:14.480
Anyway, your family is so progressive.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.949
Three couples from three generations...

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:18.820
all living together, unmarried.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:22.420
Gosh, so progressive. Super cool.

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:24.290
Is that an insult?

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:29.730
Hey, since when is "progressive" an insult?

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.170
But this whole sudden moving-in thing...

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:39.480
was partly to because of that bold catfish, isn't it?

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.450
Well, like a "two birds with one stone" kind of thing?

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.250
(Seah Women's Hospital)

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.949
What are you doing later? I'm going to the kids' cafe...

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:51.690
with my kids. Do you want to come?

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.260
Dream on.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:59.460
Hello.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.400
Your lunch break isn't over yet, right?

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.770
I hear you're living with Do Hyun.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.480
And that's a reason to show up at my work?

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.650
Well, it's more than that.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.960
I'm curious if you're planning on marrying him.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.090
Why would you be curious about that?

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.270
Someone once told me...

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:42.440
you can date, break up, be apart, and still get back together.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.680
They say a spouse is the only family you can actually choose.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:50.950
What's your point?

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:54.750
My point is, this isn't as simple as you think.

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:59.690
You can't choose parents or kids, nor can you become strangers.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.990
Do Hyun is Daniel's father, after all.

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:06.830
And I'm his mother.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:17.370
I'm not sure yet,

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.010
but if we do get married, I'll be sure to let you know.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:29.290
Jun Kyung.

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:32.120
You know, every time I see you,

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.620
I can't help but feel that we're a bit alike.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:44.870
- How so? - We're both bad at showing emotion.

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:47.500
We get jealous easily, so we get hurt easily.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.510
We run away the second we feel exposed.

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:53.080
And we don't know how to give or accept an apology.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.480
Am I wrong?

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:14.800
You know, every time I see you,

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.070
I can't help but feel that we're a bit alike.

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:32.150
Alike? How are we anything alike?

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:44.860
Hey, you all made it. Thanks for coming.

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.430
Thank you for making the trip.

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.269
- Hi. You've been well, I hope? - Thanks for making the trip.

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:52.300
Good to see you.

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:54.740
Well, would you look at you?

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:58.770
From community chief, to unemployed, and now a business owner?

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:02.340
Your life's been quite a ride, hasn't it? Congratulations.

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:06.679
- Oh, you really shouldn't have. - Ta-da!

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.420
- What? - Lose the "Jackpot!" It's tacky.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.250
Bom's Campsite Jackpot!

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.520
- Thank you. - Sure.

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:17.190
All right, everyone, let's go! Let's go! In we go.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.460
Your hands!

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.970
- Please, go on in. - Okay.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.400
Gosh, the air is so fresh out here.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.870
- This is so delicious! - You like it?

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:30.970
- Eat up, everyone. - Thank you.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.240
Go on, have some.

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:33.810
- Okay. - All right.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:47.120
- Liking it? - I'm loving it. It's so nice.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.360
I love it.

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:51.990
- Stop using your hands! - Here, eat.

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:53.930
Leave it. I'll get it myself.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.300
- Hey! I don't want it. - Just eat.

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:12.250
What's on your mind?

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:16.790
Just thinking.

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:20.090
It's kind of amazing.

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.360
How we could meet without knowing the other existed,

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:30.870
and after all this time, end up right here together.

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:37.270
It is, isn't it?

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:45.280
If not for your brave confession that day,

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.680
we probably...

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.220
wouldn't be here together right now.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.060
Wait, I confessed to you?

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:01.730
Look at you, pretending you don't remember.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.800
No, seriously. That day...

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:10.310
Don't you remember what you said after you rang my doorbell?

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.680
What did I say? But wait, I don't think that was a confession.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:16.750
My goodness.

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:20.150
You really don't remember, do you?

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:23.749
I remember everything you wore,

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:26.920
right down to your shoes.

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:28.690
No way.

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:34.400
A white shirt with a big collar that looked like wings,

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:36.600
and your pants were also white.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:42.640
You must've been in a rush because you flew to my door in slippers.

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:44.210
Like a little cherub.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:47.410
I've got goosebumps. That's incredible.

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:53.050
What could I possibly not know about you?

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:57.520
I spend my days observing you, studying you,

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:00.020
and trying to figure you out.

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:04.530
I'm the top expert on Seo Jun Kyung.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:07.200
An expert on Seo Jun Kyung, are you?

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:14.270
- Gosh! - What's wrong? What's happening?

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:19.440
Since I have a desk job,

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:21.780
- my back's been aching right here. - Your back? It hurts right here?

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.840
That's the spot.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:25.280
- Right here? - Gosh, that feels good.

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.119
- But if it hurts, - That's so relieving.

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.620
Doesn't pressing on it make it hurt more?

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.850
- That's the stuff. - Doesn't it hurt more?

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.690
Inviting people over for a housewarming party...

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:38.860
I thought it was just a thing you do since others do, but I was wrong.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.760
What do you mean?

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:47.340
It feels like a way to show people, "Hey, look, I'm doing well."

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:51.540
And it's like promising yourself you'll live even better from now on.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.550
I'm not exactly sure what "living well" means, but...

00:47:57.950 --> 00:48:01.120
Living well...

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:03.890
Take a towel, for instance.

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:10.060
When it's all fluffy and soft, you use it for your face.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:15.560
Once it gets frayed and rough, you use it for your feet.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:20.640
And when the stains won't come out, and it's gotten limp,

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.570
you turn it into a rag.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:28.110
I guess living like that...

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:31.550
That's what it means to live well, I suppose.

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:37.450
Thank you for coming.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:41.760
I really mean it.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:47.760
Ja Yeong.

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:18.330
Here's to the good life

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:24.170
Let's give it our all, here's to the good life!

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:30.370
Here's to the good life

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.010
Look at her. She's totally wasted.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.680
She's the only one who's drunk.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.260
Wait a second, hold on.

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:57.700
What? What are you doing?

00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:58.970
I've always wanted to do this.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:00.500
Do what?

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.370
- What? - Honey, be home early.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:11.750
What was that? That makes us sound like newlyweds.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.750
But that suit is so dated. Is this the only one you own?

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:20.490
It's not like I have many chances to wear a suit.

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.060
It just goes to show how I've been living.

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.730
If I win the prize money, I'll get you a tie.

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:33.070
No, I'll buy you a whole new suit. A designer one.

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:36.570
You're just saying that because you don't expect to win?

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:41.540
Once I'm a novelist and you're a professor,

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:43.680
should we get married?

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:47.720
Stop it. That's so embarrassing. Seriously, don't.

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.190
Do a good job, hubby.

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:53.050
- Okay. You got this. - Sure.

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:57.089
- I'll call you. - Okay, you got this!

00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:58.090
Bye.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.730
Professor Song vouched for me, so you don't have to worry.

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:06.640
Right, okay. Don't be nervous. When asked, be clear...

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:08.700
and answer them confidently, like "Yes, sir!" Got it?

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.310
Gosh, I'm not nervous.

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:13.710
Okay, son. Go do your best. You got this, and don't be nervous.

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:16.210
- I told you, I'm not nervous. - Right, okay.

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:19.880
He seems nervous, though.

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.640
Jin Ho! Jin Ho, look at this!

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:45.140
So many wild shoots up there! Jin Ho, look.

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:51.210
Right.

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:54.250
Oh, no, where is my head?

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.360
- Interned at a broadcast station? - Yes, I did.

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:08.200
- Your thesis passed. - Yes.

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:13.400
- Six more credits and you graduate? - Yes, that's correct.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.670
So why are your undergraduate grades such a mess?

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:23.950
I was dealing with personal issues at the time.

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:25.510
Like what?

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:31.290
- Not that I'm actually asking. - Right.

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:34.320
Professor Song did recommend you,

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:38.660
we have an opening for a liberal arts lecturer,

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:42.059
but I need to see the department head.

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:44.070
It's policy, but I'll contact you.

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:48.270
- Yes, thank you, sir. - All right.

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:52.670
Jin Ho.

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.340
Are you still mad at me?

00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:58.310
I'm not mad.

00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:01.720
A fire out here in the mountains would be a total disaster.

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.020
You're right. That could have been a disaster.

00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:09.190
I guess I got carried away. I wasn't thinking straight.

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:11.690
I'm so sorry.

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:14.700
I promise, I'll be more careful from now on.

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:21.540
I'm glad you like it here enough to lose your head over it.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:27.010
So does that mean you're not mad anymore?

00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:30.050
No. Still mad.

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.210
- Come on. - Stop it. What are you doing?

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:39.820
Hey, stop. I'm not over it, so just get away from me.

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.220
Stop it.

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:50.070
Do you know what's more important than the diamond for a proposal?

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:52.330
What is it?

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.200
Timing.

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:56.340
Is that too cliche?

00:53:57.110 --> 00:54:00.740
It's not about your timing or even your timing as a couple.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:02.980
It's all about her timing.

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:06.150
How are you supposed to know that?

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:07.980
That's what makes it so difficult.

00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:18.190
I told you I could've just taken the shuttle.

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:20.130
I was bored.

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:21.900
Your mom's unemployed, you know.

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:25.100
Then get a job.

00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:28.740
Why don't you skip class and go get some tteokbokki with me?

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.380
Better yet, just quit your classes and hang out with me all the time.

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:35.780
How could I not go to my classes?

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:40.220
Mom, you're really so different from other moms.

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.720
So you wish I were like the other moms?

00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:46.860
No, I'd hate that.

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:51.330
But...

00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:54.960
aren't you going to find a boyfriend?

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:57.470
Why do you ask?

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:00.240
No reason.

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:02.870
I was just wondering.

00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:05.510
Well, Dad has a girlfriend now.

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:08.340
I thought you hated the idea of me dating.

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.749
You said you didn't want a new guy, just me, Dad, and you.

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:14.080
You wanted it to be just you, Dad, and me.

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.890
That was ages ago. I was just a kid.

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.390
And now?

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:21.760
So now you'd be okay with me having a boyfriend?

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.390
I just...

00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:28.730
I just don't want you to be lonely.

00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:33.800
Do I seem lonely to you?

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:38.410
I mean...

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:41.210
Maybe a little?

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:48.620
Okay. I'll do my best not to be lonely, then.

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:53.320
Hey, I'm really sorry.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:57.530
The session's running late, so I'm going to be a while.

00:55:57.730 --> 00:56:00.660
Oh, really? But I was just making curry.

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:04.070
After such a long, hard day.

00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.870
Coming home to curry from my love...

00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:09.800
That should've been today.

00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:13.610
The timing's just off, I guess.

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.030
- Yes! - Here it is!

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:35.530
- Quit. - Okay, quiet.

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.670
- Yes, Professor? - Yes, it's all been approved,

00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:47.180
- so we'll go ahead with your class. - What? For real?

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:49.610
We'll give it a trial run for a semester.

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:52.450
And if the students like it, you can keep doing it.

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:53.950
Yes, thank you so much.

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:57.090
- Oh, and one more thing. - Yes?

00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.420
You'll need about 5,000 dollars ready.

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:02.460
Excuse me?

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:07.060
A lot of people are competing to teach these electives,

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:11.070
and it's a desirable position, so that amount isn't out of line.

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:13.600
- Soo Jin said... - I see.

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:17.310
- this spring will be very bitter, - Oh, yes.

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:20.480
- and even crueller. - So by when...

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.510
When you think about it, we have spring all wrong.

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.150
The sunlight is warm.

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:34.460
A pleasant season that's neither too hot nor too cold.

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:39.460
It feigns a gentle nature, as if to put us at ease,

00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:45.270
but spring was never such a gentle soul.

00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:49.240
- Thank you. - Of course. Enjoy your stay.

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:50.370
We will, thank you.

00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:51.740
Bye!

00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:56.210
Just when you think it's only going to get warmer...

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:59.280
- Hey, Ja Yeong. - Have you seen my Bom?

00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:04.150
An unexpected late-season cold snap can return.

00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:06.450
It's just that I can't find Bom.

00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:09.560
Bom!

00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:12.330
Bom, where are you?

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:17.670
The unstable air creates drastic temperature swings,

00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.110
the day and night wear different faces,

00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:28.710
which can often throw us off.

00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:34.050
With its colourless, shimmering heat haze,

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.850
this is the spring that leaves us disoriented.

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:42.560
This year,

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:46.030
once again,

00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:49.700
is proving to be...

00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:54.270
anything but peaceful.

00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:03.780
(Love Me)
