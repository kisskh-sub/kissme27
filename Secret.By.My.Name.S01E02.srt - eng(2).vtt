WEBVTT

00:00:31.187 --> 00:00:33.487
Director Li's on boarding ceremony
is quite memorable.

00:00:36.187 --> 00:00:38.727
Do you need me to show you
how to erase the records completely?

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.407
You despicable fool.

00:00:48.427 --> 00:00:49.807
Where did you hide it?

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.206
Young Chairman Tan's way
of saying good morning

00:00:56.546 --> 00:00:57.807
is quite distinctive as well.

00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:00.966
You failed
to capture the bacon and eggs,

00:01:01.147 --> 00:01:04.087
but you did record your own people
installing the GPS the wrong way around.

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:08.087
Would you like me to enroll them
in a technical training course?

00:01:09.387 --> 00:01:10.167
Hello?

00:01:10.627 --> 00:01:12.567
Tan Fijian sent you, didn't he?

00:01:13.347 --> 00:01:15.007
No.

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:22.526
Li Shujing.

00:01:23.707 --> 00:01:26.007
The Tan Group is not
your playground for revenge.

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:32.465
Do you believe I could send you back

00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:33.927
to that rainy night you crawled out of?

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:37.160
So early in the morning,
Young Chairman Tan,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.966
and already in such a temper?

00:01:40.226 --> 00:01:42.807
Are you afraid
I will take your president's chair,

00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:45.046
or are you afraid I will take your

00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:47.126
heartbeat?

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:54.346
Li Shujing. Do you really think the Tan Group
is scrap fabric for you to cut at will?

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.146
You are being far too naive right now.

00:01:56.147 --> 00:01:58.207
Is Young Chairman Tan
showing concern for me?

00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:00.647
Is it possible that
I am concerned about you as well?

00:02:01.707 --> 00:02:03.207
After all, everything I am doing

00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:04.626
is to help you clear out

00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:06.207
those stubborn old men on the board.

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:08.326
That way,

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:12.246
I can help the Tan Group

00:02:13.826 --> 00:02:15.366
set aside a thicker reserve

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:17.127
for what lies ahead.

00:02:19.107 --> 00:02:20.167
Li Shujing.

00:02:20.547 --> 00:02:22.727
I am not interested in playing
mind games with you anymore.

00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:24.727
This scar

00:02:24.786 --> 00:02:26.206
has hurt me for eight years.

00:02:26.627 --> 00:02:28.740
I do not believe there is nothing
of me left in your heart.

00:02:29.346 --> 00:02:31.146
I believe there is still
a way for us to go back...

00:02:31.147 --> 00:02:31.967
Shujing,

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:33.407
I am back from my trip.

00:02:38.147 --> 00:02:39.167
Jianfei.

00:02:41.186 --> 00:02:42.326
Zuoyan.

00:02:42.346 --> 00:02:44.366
Young Chairman Tan
came to see me for a chat,

00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:47.567
and to offer a bit of business advice.

00:02:52.947 --> 00:02:54.247
Let me formally introduce her.

00:02:54.586 --> 00:02:55.646
Li Shujing.

00:02:55.707 --> 00:02:57.185
A fashion designer,

00:02:57.186 --> 00:02:58.326
and also my

00:03:00.186 --> 00:03:01.247
fiancee.

00:03:10.547 --> 00:03:11.447
Hello.

00:03:13.306 --> 00:03:15.127
We are family now.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.459
=Secret By My Name=

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.425
(Adapted from the novel
Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.275
=Episode 2=

00:03:44.987 --> 00:03:46.687
How did you and my brother meet again?

00:03:46.827 --> 00:03:47.847
At a gathering.

00:03:47.947 --> 00:03:48.806
Really?

00:03:49.707 --> 00:03:50.886
Then why did I hear

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:52.527
it was a traffic accident?

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:56.646
You must be mistaken.

00:03:58.746 --> 00:03:59.866
Come to my office later.

00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:00.146
We...

00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:01.567
Sorry, Young Chairman Tan.

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.326
I still have work to finish.

00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:16.826
That was an easy bluff,
and you gave it away.

00:04:16.827 --> 00:04:17.847
Looks like

00:04:18.107 --> 00:04:19.967
there really is no feeling
between you and him.

00:04:22.347 --> 00:04:23.606
Qian.

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:26.686
Look at how you drew this waistline.

00:04:28.587 --> 00:04:30.087
It has no structure at all.

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:32.366
Come to my office tonight.

00:04:32.467 --> 00:04:34.767
I will show you step by step
how it should be done.

00:04:36.746 --> 00:04:39.126
Should Mr. Wang's
lesson be livestreamed?

00:04:39.347 --> 00:04:41.287
It would be perfect for the board to see

00:04:41.587 --> 00:04:43.745
how you used substandard materials
as an excuse

00:04:43.746 --> 00:04:45.560
to block the Autumn Winter Alpine fabrics,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.840
then turned around and approved
twenty tons of inferior cotton

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.967
for the childrenswear line.

00:04:50.626 --> 00:04:51.606
Get out.

00:04:54.066 --> 00:04:55.167
Li Shujing, you...

00:04:57.266 --> 00:04:58.226
I am blocking it.

00:04:58.227 --> 00:04:59.226
Yes, I am.

00:04:59.227 --> 00:05:00.527
And what can you do about it?

00:05:01.946 --> 00:05:04.065
If you have the courage,
take it up with the dead.

00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:07.385
Or what, do you want me to go with you
and pay a visit to your father's coffin?

00:05:07.386 --> 00:05:09.366
Mr. Wang, you really
have a sharp sense of humor.

00:05:10.027 --> 00:05:11.446
What you just tore up

00:05:11.706 --> 00:05:14.400
was a special rebate list from the supplier.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.280
So tell me,
do these baby garment threads,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.760
with formaldehyde far above the limit,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.327
destroy a child's lungs first,

00:05:19.587 --> 00:05:22.346
or do they ruin the tires on the luxury car
you bought with kickbacks?

00:05:22.347 --> 00:05:23.527
I am warning you.

00:05:24.027 --> 00:05:24.986
Here,

00:05:24.987 --> 00:05:27.185
do not casually accuse

00:05:27.186 --> 00:05:28.906
a veteran of the Tan Group.

00:05:28.907 --> 00:05:30.527
You could be sued for defamation.

00:05:31.987 --> 00:05:34.647
Whether it is defamation or not,
you know that best yourself.

00:05:36.186 --> 00:05:39.006
Approve the application now,

00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:40.305
and I might overlook

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:42.287
the price of the watch on your wrist,

00:05:43.186 --> 00:05:44.466
which happens to equal

00:05:44.467 --> 00:05:47.126
the amount you cut
from the childrenswear safety budget.

00:05:51.587 --> 00:05:52.566
Li Shujing.

00:05:52.706 --> 00:05:54.287
You think you are impressive?

00:05:54.347 --> 00:05:55.666
This batch of fabric,

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:57.407
I will not approve it.

00:05:57.626 --> 00:05:59.806
Just wait for
the Autumn Alpine line to collapse.

00:06:00.347 --> 00:06:01.606
I want to see

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:04.486
whether you can still stay
at the Tan Group.

00:06:07.027 --> 00:06:08.006
Just wait.

00:06:14.987 --> 00:06:16.287
How is the investigation going?

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.446
To get rid of him,

00:06:18.626 --> 00:06:20.767
we will need something much heavier.

00:06:30.146 --> 00:06:31.926
My brother really
is generous with his trust.

00:06:33.746 --> 00:06:35.305
Leaving someone like you

00:06:35.306 --> 00:06:36.527
working alone late at night,

00:06:36.987 --> 00:06:38.866
without worrying
you might sneak into storage,

00:06:38.867 --> 00:06:39.825
find some rope,

00:06:39.826 --> 00:06:41.767
and tie a neat bow for him as well.

00:06:43.467 --> 00:06:45.527
If Young Chairman Tan
misses the past that much,

00:06:45.587 --> 00:06:46.505
why not take me now,

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:48.527
somewhere your brother could never find?

00:06:49.987 --> 00:06:51.207
This time,

00:06:51.467 --> 00:06:53.366
I would make sure it is tighter,

00:06:53.907 --> 00:06:55.327
so you would never

00:06:55.667 --> 00:06:56.806
get away again.

00:06:56.946 --> 00:06:58.967
You almost made that sound tempting.

00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:11.825
Shujing. If you were working late,
you should have told me earlier.

00:07:11.826 --> 00:07:13.327
Staying up this late
is not good for you.

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:15.145
I stopped by the florist,

00:07:15.146 --> 00:07:16.446
and got held up a bit.

00:07:17.467 --> 00:07:18.446
Do you like them?

00:07:21.946 --> 00:07:24.366
Looks like my brother
does not know Shujing at all.

00:07:24.467 --> 00:07:26.006
She does not like flowers.

00:07:26.306 --> 00:07:26.866
She likes...

00:07:26.867 --> 00:07:28.167
I used not to.

00:07:28.787 --> 00:07:29.967
Now I do.

00:07:34.587 --> 00:07:35.486
Jianfei,

00:07:36.467 --> 00:07:37.566
what are you

00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:38.647
doing here?

00:07:38.706 --> 00:07:40.686
I came to discuss with Shujing

00:07:42.347 --> 00:07:43.366
how to deal with

00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:44.806
some old things.

00:07:47.306 --> 00:07:48.207
Jianfei,

00:07:48.787 --> 00:07:50.185
you have not changed,

00:07:50.186 --> 00:07:51.366
still joking around.

00:07:52.306 --> 00:07:53.407
But,

00:07:55.706 --> 00:07:57.926
this parking lot at two in the morning

00:07:58.587 --> 00:08:00.207
is not the place for catching up.

00:08:02.347 --> 00:08:03.046
Alright.

00:08:03.146 --> 00:08:04.906
It is time for you to go home.

00:08:04.907 --> 00:08:06.606
Your brother and I should leave as well.

00:08:08.946 --> 00:08:09.847
Excuse us.

00:08:19.146 --> 00:08:20.207
(Li Shujing)

00:08:20.987 --> 00:08:22.446
(I want to see)

00:08:22.706 --> 00:08:24.366
(how long this act can really last.)

00:08:33.186 --> 00:08:34.167
So?

00:08:34.227 --> 00:08:35.185
This piece of evidence,

00:08:35.186 --> 00:08:36.207
is it big enough?

00:08:37.306 --> 00:08:39.745
Not bad, kid. You actually dug this up.

00:08:39.746 --> 00:08:41.527
I am warning you,
do not get physical with me.

00:08:41.827 --> 00:08:43.046
Well done.

00:08:49.666 --> 00:08:50.767
(Wang Jinkai.)

00:08:51.307 --> 00:08:52.446
(Eight years.)

00:08:53.146 --> 00:08:55.086
(The debt you owe the Li family)

00:08:55.467 --> 00:08:57.966
(is long overdue,
and interest must now be paid in blood.)

00:08:58.812 --> 00:09:01.586
(Tan Group)

00:09:01.587 --> 00:09:04.407
Mr. Wang's so called thermal technology
is quite remarkable.

00:09:06.067 --> 00:09:07.545
Every gram of filling inside

00:09:07.546 --> 00:09:10.206
exceeds radiation limits
by one hundred and twenty seven times.

00:09:10.266 --> 00:09:12.367
A number that happens
to match your son's birthday.

00:09:12.987 --> 00:09:14.887
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

00:09:15.706 --> 00:09:17.346
Ten years ago,
you were still on your knees

00:09:17.347 --> 00:09:18.745
begging me for mercy,

00:09:18.746 --> 00:09:20.846
and now you are trying
to look respectable.

00:09:21.107 --> 00:09:22.265
Everyone knows

00:09:22.266 --> 00:09:24.767
what kind of intentions
you brought with you into the Tan Group.

00:09:28.827 --> 00:09:30.625
I also have records of your foolish son

00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:32.806
making deals with suppliers
of substandard materials.

00:09:34.426 --> 00:09:36.446
Shall we circulate them
for everyone to see?

00:09:38.707 --> 00:09:41.440
You and your son went to great lengths
to siphon money from the Tan Group,

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.946
reckless and malicious to the core.

00:09:42.947 --> 00:09:45.326
But this is no longer
a simple matter of kickbacks.

00:09:46.827 --> 00:09:47.745
Would you like

00:09:47.746 --> 00:09:48.665
me to explain

00:09:48.666 --> 00:09:50.887
how serious crimes
endangering public safety can be?

00:09:55.187 --> 00:09:56.025
Fei.

00:09:56.026 --> 00:09:57.905
I have devoted years
of my life to the Tan Group,

00:09:57.906 --> 00:10:00.167
risking everything for it.

00:10:00.187 --> 00:10:01.846
How could I possibly do such a thing?

00:10:02.146 --> 00:10:02.887
Right?

00:10:04.026 --> 00:10:06.127
Once this matter is exposed,

00:10:06.187 --> 00:10:08.167
the impact on the Tan Group

00:10:08.626 --> 00:10:09.846
would be devastating.

00:10:10.187 --> 00:10:11.046
So,

00:10:11.187 --> 00:10:12.846
this cannot be resolved so easily.

00:10:17.347 --> 00:10:19.025
So the two of you planned this together

00:10:19.026 --> 00:10:20.247
to set me up?

00:10:20.746 --> 00:10:21.607
Enough.

00:10:21.707 --> 00:10:22.745
Take Wang Jinkai away.

00:10:22.746 --> 00:10:24.247
Handle him according to procedure.

00:10:25.827 --> 00:10:27.706
This entire batch
must be destroyed immediately.

00:10:27.707 --> 00:10:28.966
None of it can enter the market.

00:10:29.227 --> 00:10:30.106
No, Fei...

00:10:30.107 --> 00:10:30.826
Fei, you...

00:10:30.827 --> 00:10:32.206
You cannot do this.

00:10:32.347 --> 00:10:33.385
My brother is unconscious,

00:10:33.386 --> 00:10:34.966
the company is unstable.

00:10:35.227 --> 00:10:35.946
And there is more.

00:10:35.947 --> 00:10:36.785
This woman

00:10:36.786 --> 00:10:38.446
forged my brother's recordings.

00:10:40.227 --> 00:10:43.046
She forced her way into the Tan Group,
and her intentions are obvious.

00:10:43.107 --> 00:10:44.127
Get up.

00:10:44.386 --> 00:10:45.025
Let me tell you,

00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:45.706
Li Shujing,

00:10:45.707 --> 00:10:47.926
you are finished at the Tan Group.

00:11:01.307 --> 00:11:02.367
You dare hit me?

00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:03.686
Tan Zuoyan.

00:11:03.947 --> 00:11:04.745
Li Shujing.

00:11:04.746 --> 00:11:06.226
The two of you will pay for this!

00:11:06.227 --> 00:11:07.046
Move.

00:11:07.786 --> 00:11:08.346
Do not move.

00:11:08.347 --> 00:11:09.527
My apologies, everyone.

00:11:09.746 --> 00:11:11.846
I truly could not
tolerate someone like that

00:11:12.227 --> 00:11:13.926
making such accusations against my

00:11:15.067 --> 00:11:16.167
fiancee.
