[Episode 6] Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.570
What's this for?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.080
It's the rule on Flower Street.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.140
Once you enter Flower Street,
you have to wear a flower.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.970
You seem pretty familiar with
the rules around here.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.289
I heard about them back at Slave House.

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:44.840
The courtesans here

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.560
are said to possess
all kinds of rare treasures—

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.289
there might even be black jade.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.520
Stop right there.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.440
Flower Street only serves
regular customers.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.960
You two look

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.360
unfamiliar.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.560
Our Flower Street

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.720
doesn't belong in the open.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.440
Do you think

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.480
you can just walk in here?

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.200
Who are you really?

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.280
Let me see—

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.020
which heartless man is it,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.520
bringing a pretty young lady here

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.440
to collect a debt?

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.160
What's this?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.260
The rule on Flower Street:

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.890
for anyone who barges in,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.320
there's only one chance—

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.720
Tea of Oblivion.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.840
This tea induces hallucinations.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.480
It will trap you in an illusion

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.079
drawn from your most painful memories,

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.200
leaving you unable to escape.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.280
Very few

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.540
survive the illusion.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.400
I must get back

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.440
what I want.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.280
No one comes unprompted.

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.880
Surely you didn't come this time

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.160
with no purpose in mind, either,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.180
right, Stone King of Hell?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.240
This pendant is the only keepsake

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.040
my mother left me.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.360
Mother said it would keep me safe.

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.680
Now I'm passing that protection to you.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.480
We must both survive.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.970
It's my fault for not protecting you well.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.130
I should have taken you with me.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.440
Where are you going?

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.200
Brother Stone, look!

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.040
I knew you wanted to kill me.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.840
Yun Zhan.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.400
Everyone you care about will die,

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.000
and she's no exception.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.520
That won't happen.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.250
You were the one who abandoned her.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.240
She froze to death long ago—

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.720
torn apart by the wolves and wild dogs

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.840
in the mountains…

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.120
Li.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.680
Mother?

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.160
Mother.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.080
I didn't kill my father.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.400
How could I have given birth to

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.000
such a wicked child like you?

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.080
You deserve to die.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.400
Mother...

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.480
Die!

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.520
Die.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.440
Die!

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.800
Go to hell!

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.760
Die!

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.240
You deserve to die!

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.080
Just die!

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.000
Die!

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.800
Wake up.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.440
Alright, that's enough.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.640
How could I bear to let you two

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.320
die here on my Flower Street?

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.560
Does it hurt?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.320
I

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.000
pity delicate young ladies

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.920
like you the most.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.370
Dragging a body that's barely half alive,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.160
you still forced your way into
my Flower Street of the underworld.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.720
What is it that you seek?

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.280
Is it

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.560
life extension?

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.610
It's black jade.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.720
Black jade?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.720
Well, black jade is

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.320
a rare and precious thing.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.880
What could you possibly offer

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.200
in exchange?

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.280
My remaining half‑life.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.400
If you've got the nerve
to soak for one night

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.880
in my Crimson Cold Pool—

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.000
a place of extreme yin energy
and bitter cold—

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.920
and still walk out alive,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.680
the black jade in this box

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.480
will be yours.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.960
It's a deal.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.960
In your current condition,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.680
you're hardly fit for such bravado.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.320
Are you truly not afraid of dying here?

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.120
I am,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.280
but I want to truly live even more—

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.960
even if it's only for one day.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.280
Where's Yun Zhan?

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.000
If I make it out alive,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.720
he must leave with me.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:18.920
Yun Zhan?

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.760
Well, I'll have to give that
some serious thought.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.480
You know the rules

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.000
of our Flower Street.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.970
One thing in exchange for another.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.500
If you want something,

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.040
you must offer something in exchange.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.320
Just name it.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.280
Seems you really care about

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.520
that young lady.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.840
Tell me,

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.920
what do you seek by coming here this time?

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.220
To cure her poison.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.410
I can't let her die here.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.600
Just name

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.480
your price.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.660
And you'd be willing to pay it,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.880
no matter what, Stone King of Hell?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.000
Of course.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:36.960
You...

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.600
Naturally, a new love

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.000
comes at the price of the old.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.280
The water in this pool
is bitterly cold indeed.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.320
The water

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.200
seeps into every inch of my skin,

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.800
sharp as countless needles.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.400
Why are you here?

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.480
You are my life.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.530
Revenge is my only purpose for living.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.600
Before I discover the truth,

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.170
Your Majesty Queen of Mocheng,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.680
you must survive.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.200
You must survive.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.680
We must both survive.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.440
We'll both survive.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.680
Even if I must climb mountains of blades

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.840
or descend into seas of fire,
I will pursue you—

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.280
until I personally put an end to you,

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.920
the last remnant of Mocheng.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.450
Aren't you afraid of death?

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.500
Are you afraid, Your Majesty?

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.760
Like a phoenix reborn from the ashes,

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.490
to face death is to be born anew.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.560
What do I have to fear?

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.480
Your Majesty,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.360
but your condition...

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.400
I know what condition

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.920
my body is in.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.290
The drink you take daily...

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.060
That so‑called calming potion
is my death warrant.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.320
I knew it.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.400
I don't care.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.490
So you've been aware

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.960
of everything all along, Your Majesty.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.440
Yet I still

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.160
can't see through you.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.250
Then, Your Majesty,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.540
how would you like to see me more clearly?

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.930
What exactly are you after?

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.160
Burning bridges now

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.040
isn't a good idea.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.720
I wonder if Li's journey

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.780
has been going well

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.250
and when she'll return.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.810
What should I do?

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.570
What should I do now?

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.840
Li,

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.080
I recently acquired

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.280
some blood swiftlet nest

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.210
and made it into sweet soup for you.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.160
Heavy guards outside,

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.680
yet silence within—

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.660
could this be some sort of
empty-fort trick?

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.080
Your Majesty, why do you

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.240
only favor Yun Zhan so much?

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.770
It truly breaks our hearts!

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.200
So they're having a jealous quarrel.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:33.960
Your Highness,

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.840
shall we come back another day?

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.800
You and I have been childhood sweethearts,

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.880
and I dare say
my feelings for you are sincere.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.880
But who does that Yun Zhan think he is?

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.560
He must have ulterior motives toward you.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.520
How could you act like this, Your Majesty?
