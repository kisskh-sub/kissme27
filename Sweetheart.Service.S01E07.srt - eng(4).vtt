JUNG Myeongcheol as Taeha

YOON Hyunkwon as Jaemin

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.934
LEE Suyeon as Suyeon

LEE Jaehyeop as Minwoo

"Sweetheart Service"

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.544
(Chapter 7: Take Five)

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.229
It's definitely because of Yooha…

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:17.327
Um…

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:21.538
Taeha!

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.335
How about...

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:29.005
taking the day off and
getting some fresh air?

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:32.675
I think it might be
good to clear your head.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.259
Now?

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.471
It's almost opening time.

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:38.598
It's...

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:41.643
usually slow today anyway.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:43.602
What?

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.241
Wow...

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.373
- I smell something.
- Really?

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:05.541
Wow...

00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:27.730
How about this?

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.024
Ah... okay, sure.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.068
- Oh, that looks great.
- Does it suit me?

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.445
Then I'll...

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:42.203
That's cute, then...

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:47.375
Oh... wow.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.214
You have to smile, you have to smile.

00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:55.800
This time, I'll come down.

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.144
No, not that one. That's
too heavy. Use this one.

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:52.940
I told you that wouldn't work.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.524
Let me give it a try.

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:56.069
Ugh, I'm anxious.

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:04.661
Well, at least I lifted it.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:46.869
What am I even doing here?

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.232
I want to go home…

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:23.781
He really gives his all...
no matter what it is...

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:34.876
Uh…

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:38.588
Isn't that a bit too detailed right there?

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.676
Art needs specificity.

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:17.460
How was it?

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:21.172
I wanted to go home…

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.344
You should've seen your face!

00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:28.888
I had the hardest time not laughing.

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:34.393
I'm hungry... Let's go
grab something to eat!

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:37.062
Aren't you working on something else today?

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.063
Yeah.

00:06:38.147 --> 00:06:39.649
Well… nothing else today.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.400
This was it.

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:45.404
Yooha...

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.074
Why do you live so… intensely?

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:51.327
Ah...

00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:54.872
I mean... it just seems
like you do a lot of jobs.

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:59.210
To make money.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.130
So,

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.175
what do you want to do with the money?

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.392
Actually… it's because of my brother.

00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:18.563
He raised me.

00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:21.357
Gave up everything because of me.

00:07:24.735 --> 00:07:27.155
I'm so thankful, but also... sorry.

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.241
He's... too good for me.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.330
He always said, “Because we're family.”

00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:39.917
So I thought, "We're family,"

00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:42.378
and I leaned on him.

00:07:43.087 --> 00:07:45.089
But at some point,

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:47.884
I realized

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.970
he was sacrificing too much for me.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.602
So yeah, I'm saving up
to become independent.

00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:02.190
To give back even just a little of the time
and effort he gave me.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.859
Even a little bit.

00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:15.870
Actually,

00:08:18.039 --> 00:08:20.374
we're not related by blood.

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:26.297
I still remember it clearly.

00:08:27.548 --> 00:08:29.592
It was freezing that day.

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:34.722
I had no home, nowhere to go...

00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:39.060
but Taeha held my hand.

00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:45.191
He was only a middle schooler...

00:08:48.402 --> 00:08:49.612
Back then,

00:08:50.404 --> 00:08:52.657
his hand was so cold.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.242
But strangely,

00:08:56.577 --> 00:08:59.038
I didn't feel cold at all.

00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:03.751
That night, we sat on
a bench at Sunset Park

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.003
and watched the stars all night.

00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:08.297
That place...

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:10.758
Do you still go there sometimes?

00:09:16.847 --> 00:09:18.015
No.

00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:20.935
I don't really go anymore.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.690
Back then, he was everything to me.

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.109
Now...

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:32.196
that memory just feels... heavy.

00:09:36.617 --> 00:09:40.121
So yeah... I'm saving money
to become independent!

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:42.748
Then...

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:45.501
what do you want to do after that?

00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:47.628
After that...?

00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:52.133
Let's say you become independent.

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:56.887
Have you thought about
what you want to do next?

00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:00.807
Honestly,

00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:03.269
I've never really thought about it.

00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:08.899
All I ever thought about was
not being a burden to him.

00:10:10.192 --> 00:10:12.486
Then what are you good at?

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.073
Hmm... I'm good at everything, I think?

00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:21.871
Oh! I did theater in college, and
people said I was pretty good at acting.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.583
Yeah, you are good.

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:27.335
Oh, really?

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.170
Thanks.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:33.215
Anything you felt while
working all those part-time jobs?

00:10:34.508 --> 00:10:36.260
- There is one thing.
- What is it?

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:41.891
Making an app that connects
people to one another.

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:45.435
Strawberry Market has a similar feature,

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:47.688
but it's a bit complicated
and inconvenient to use.

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:50.023
To make ours different from others,

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:51.984
it could be something that

00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:54.820
helps people find their soulmate.

00:10:58.115 --> 00:10:59.367
That's actually pretty good.

00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:02.786
Oh, it was just a random idea.

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:04.789
No, really. I think it's solid.

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:07.500
Come on, don't hype me up too much.

00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:10.017
No, I mean it. I think it's a real idea.

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:14.465
You should think about it seriously.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:18.635
Then what should we name the app?

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:22.263
How about "Heartbeat Factory"?
A place where love is made?

00:11:22.264 --> 00:11:23.891
Heartbeat Factory.

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:26.768
Maybe something a bit more refined?

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:27.645
Refined...

00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:30.188
Like… a Heartbeat Factory
that prints out love? “Dugeun Factory!”

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:31.774
Or just “Dugeun”? Like thump-thump?

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.277
What about “1200g”?

00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:37.822
What's that?

00:11:38.614 --> 00:11:41.617
In Korean, geun means 600 grams.

00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:45.109
So ♪du-geun♪—two geun—is 1200 grams. It
sounds like a heartbeat, “dugeun dugeun,”

00:11:45.579 --> 00:11:47.747
Calling it just “Dugeun” sounds nice,

00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:50.028
but “1200g” gives it a bit
more meaning, don't you think?

00:11:56.298 --> 00:11:58.300
- Thank you.
- For what?

00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.093
Actually,

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.388
I've been feeling a little worn out lately.

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.101
I figured.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:09.103
Sometimes...

00:12:09.353 --> 00:12:11.564
you need to live for yourself too.

00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:03.949
Thanks for spending
time with me today, Taeha

00:13:07.077 --> 00:13:11.123
No, thank you. I had a
great time, thanks to you.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.002
I'm glad to hear that.

00:13:27.014 --> 00:13:28.224
Have I...

00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:34.230
been too...

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:37.024
obsessed with Yooha?

00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:40.735
Taeha.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.073
No.

00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:48.118
You just care about him a lot.

00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:55.709
But maybe it became too much for him.

00:13:57.336 --> 00:14:02.299
That doesn't mean he hates you.

00:14:03.133 --> 00:14:05.843
I just don't want you
to think so negatively.

00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:10.724
I think Yooha is just trying
to stand on his own now.

00:14:11.892 --> 00:14:13.561
He did graduate, after all.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.484
Still... it kind of hurts.

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:27.700
Now that I think about it,
maybe I was the one relying on Yooha more.

00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:30.786
Of course it hurts.

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.789
I'd feel the same way.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.041
Yooha is...

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.338
someone really important to you.

00:14:46.093 --> 00:14:47.136
I just...

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.641
hope you don't only think about Yooha.

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:58.063
I hope you take care of
yourself a bit more too.

00:15:02.443 --> 00:15:07.823
Maybe you could... find
someone else to lean on?

00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:14.663
Hmm...

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:21.920
Will you be that person?

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:32.180
Why not? I like talking with you.

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:33.181
Well,

00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:35.601
if you're okay with someone like me.

00:15:40.147 --> 00:15:41.899
You're really kind.

00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:44.109
Am I?

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:49.239
Then, Taeha...

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:53.410
if you ever need someone
to talk to, come to me.

00:15:54.244 --> 00:15:56.038
I'll always listen.

00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:03.921
Thanks, Jaemin.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:17:00.561
I was just stopping by for a second...
You didn't have to walk me all the way.

00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:03.731
I wanted to.

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:08.485
I'm okay now. Thanks to you.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.741
Taeha...

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.306
You looked cold.

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:48.399
Well then!

00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.944
Get home safe!

00:19:15.362 --> 00:19:18.198
