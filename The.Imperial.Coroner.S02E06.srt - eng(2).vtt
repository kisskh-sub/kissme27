00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.240
(The workload of the Three Judicial Offices
is endless,)

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.320
(yet we're always short of hands.)

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.239
(After His Highness's reminder,)

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:22.480
(I came to realize)

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.679
(that bringing in more skilled coroners)

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:25.960
(is the only way forward.)

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.879
(But good coroners are rare,)

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.480
(and most people see me
only as the princess consort,)

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.439
(so few are willing to join.)

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:34.620
(Professional technique. Clear procedure.
Keen observation. Accurate judgment.)

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.920
(I never expected You Chen'an's
coroner skills to be this good.)

(yet he is the King of Nanzhao's son,)

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:45.359
(deliberately kept hidden.)

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.560

to be taken lightly.)

=Episode 6=

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:30.439
But to be frank,
the chart is far too precious.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.860
Please forgive me for not lending it out.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.919
If it is truly so valuable,
why did you offer it of your own accord

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.159
as a condition for entering
the Three Judicial Offices?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.759
It's not an exchange,
Commandery Prince An.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.420
If Commandery Princess Consort An
accepts me as her disciple,

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:46.919
then we become mentor and disciple.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.639
It would only be proper
for her to look at the chart.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.360
I wonder whether you

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.159
will grant me this wish

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.400
to learn.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.479
But you're of noble status,
so I can't decide this on my own.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.319
Unless...

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.560
Unless there's an imperial decree.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.860
Commandery Prince An.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.599
Have you grown used to life
in the capital these days?

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.039
If you lack anything,
you may speak to the Ministry of Rites.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.290
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:23.800
Great Tang is prosperous,

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.039
and its talents are many.

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:26.960
The more I see,

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.120
the more I realize

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.199
how shallow I once was.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:30.479
Very well.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.319
I also hope you'll learn well

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.919
and bring Great Tang's culture back
to Nanzhao.

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:38.240
Your Majesty,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.199
I have one request.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.759
Go on.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.170
I have long heard

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.670
that Commandery Princess Consort An
holds the title of Imperial Coroner.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.220
I wish to enter the Three Judicial Offices
and study under her.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.719
Your Majesty may not know this,
but I was born of humble origin.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.350
When I was young, I once fell into danger
and was saved by someone.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.120
From then on,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.680
I became fascinated

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.599
with the work of coroners.

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.479
While I was in Nanzhao,

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:03.919
I learned some coroner skills.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.879
I also have

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.840
my own reasons.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.759
On my way to the capital,

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.520
I was attacked several times.

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.159
Someone wanted me dead,

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.520
I survived.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.630
Commandery Prince An

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:17.879
and Commandery Princess Consort An
saved my life.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.720
I trust them deeply

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.319
and feel close to them.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.079
Commandery Prince An,

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:26.600
Second Prince truly wishes

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.240
to work with the Three Judicial Offices.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.399
What do you think?

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.879
Then,

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:32.839
I will give it my all.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.759
Since Second Prince
is frank and sincere,

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.000
the Three Judicial Offices aren't
without magnanimity.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.880
Thank you, Commandery Prince An.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.439
Second Prince.

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:50.560
May I

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.959
look at the chart now?

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.720
Of course.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.590
I didn't show you only because
I wished to enter the office.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:56.639
It was a last resort.

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:58.680
Commandery Prince An, please forgive me.

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:01.279
It's fine.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:05.480
I stand alone in Chang'an.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.920
You wished to see the chart,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.790
but never once used your power
to force me.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.990
That's the conduct
of a true gentleman.

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:13.199
I apologize

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:15.000
for my petty tricks.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.920
Stop frowning.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.720
Your brows are drooping.
You've been worrying too much.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.079
What's been troubling you so much?

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.130
You Chen'an is joining
the Three Judicial Offices.

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:31.560
What?

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:34.480
Didn't you say
he has a sensitive identity?

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.079
This was agreed upon
with His Majesty.

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:41.519
You Chen'an wishes to enter the office
and study coroner's work.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.279
That puts you in a difficult spot.

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:45.839
It truly does.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.720
Chen You'an

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:48.680
is straightforward

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:49.959
and pure-hearted,

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.399
yet he mustn't be underestimated.

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:52.300
What makes you say so?

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.519
First,

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:55.319
since arriving in Great Tang,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.680
he has been through danger,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.759
yet he always appears weak.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.319
There's nothing about him
that makes people wary.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:01.879
Perfectly airtight.

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.319
But Nanzhao has its ambitions.

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.040
Would they send such a man

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.160
as their envoy?

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.839
Second,

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:09.879
though

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.399
he was born low,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.279
his status is noble.

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:16.390
Now that this concerns
both Great Tang and Nanzhao.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:18.260
We can neither treat him
lightly nor harshly.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.240
We must guard against him,
but also protect him.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.590
That's what makes this so hard.

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:25.600
You're right.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.920
Bringing You Chen'an in

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.079
is like inviting him into a trap.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.399
But if we use him poorly,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.639
we may instead be letting a wolf in.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:35.439
We mustn't act rashly.

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:36.800
I understand.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.279
What do you understand?

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:41.680
Your Majesty means

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:44.120
that You Chen'an is
already inside the trap.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.399
All that remains

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.319
is to watch quietly
and see what happens.

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:50.160
All right.

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:50.959
Point taken.

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:52.920
I'll help you keep an eye on him.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.319
Aside from coroner duties,
I won't say a word.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.400
I won't cause you trouble.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.439
You should be watching me instead.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.199
I'm speaking seriously.

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:04.720
My apologies.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.399
To make amends,

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:09.519
I have a gift for you.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.780
(Anatomical Chart of Bones and Organs)

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.120
Chart?

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.800
This...

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:18.279
This is my apology.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.439
I copied it myself this afternoon.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.240
You really do have a way with things.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.790
But on one condition.

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:28.399
You must dine with me tonight.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.519
What are you talking about?

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:32.399
Even without this chart,

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:33.680
I would still dine with you.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:43.639
This is remarkable.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.439
I didn't look closely last time.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.439
This is a whole human body,
taken apart and drawn piece by piece.

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.879
Isn't that a corpse?

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.000
What's so nice about it?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.639
Yes,

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:57.439
it's nice.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.600
Nicer than me?

00:07:59.360 --> 00:07:59.920
Mm.

00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:06.839
It never lasts
if one relies only on beauty, huh?

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:09.560
Before, you said
I was the most beautiful.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.480
Now someone else surpasses me.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.560
There's no one else.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.639
I have you.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.600
I won't look at anyone else.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:23.839
Fine.

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:26.879
Enough of that empty flattery.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.240
Even if I were that good,

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:29.800
why can't I compare with a corpse?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.490
How could you compare yourself to that?

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.159
It's on paper,

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.360
but you're alive.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.440
So my only advantage over it

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:37.399
is that I'm not dead?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.440
Of course not.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.399
Look.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.200
This nose compared to yours...

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.399
The eyes compared to yours...

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.399
The mouth...

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.120
Your Highness,

00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:01.240
the only way you surpass ot

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.039
is that you're not dead.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.559
No, that's not what I meant.

00:09:08.759 --> 00:09:09.879
I mean,

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:12.679
your eyes certainly look more alive.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:13.799
But

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.159
the figure and features in this chart

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.279
are extremely similar to yours.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.559
Chu Chu.

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:26.399
Are you saying

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:28.200
that every part in this chart

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.080
comes from the same person
and that person looks very much like me?

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:34.039
The muscles in this chart

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:36.159
fit perfectly

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.080
over the bones.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.240
The heart, lungs, and other organs

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.840
fit exactly

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.240
within the flesh and bones.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.360
This is not a patchwork
of different bodies.

00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:48.639
It looks more like

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.120
one single person was taken apart alive.

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:53.159
So you mean,

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.360
on the surface, it looks like me,

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.639
but beneath the skin,

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.279
it's unknown.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:00.720
Exactly.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.360
Unless one day

00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:04.279
I personally cut you open.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:10.879
Let's eat.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:13.960
All right.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.100
(Three Judicial Offices)

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.200
Second Prince?

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.399
Greetings, mentor.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.840
Why are you dressed like this?

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.920
Don't people of the Central Plains say
one should follow local customs?

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.320
I came here to study.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.020
Of course I should dress
like you, Mentor.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.559
Setting aside all those titles,

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.620
from now on,

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:55.480
I'll treat myself as a true coroner.

00:10:56.279 --> 00:10:56.960
Second Prince,

00:10:57.399 --> 00:10:58.600
don't call me mentor.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.120
We learn from each other.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.440
That will feel more at ease.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.799
Then you should stop calling me
Second Prince either.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.140
Now that I've joined
the Three Judicial Offices,

00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:06.100
I'm simply You Chen'an.

00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:08.279
You Chen'an,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.000
welcome.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:10.480
Thank you,

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.080
Chu Chu.

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:20.000
Is it rude

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.200
if I call you that?

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.879
It just feels more proper for work.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.159
It's fine.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.720
Come, let's examine the body.

00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:30.080
By the way,

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:31.919
You Chen'an,

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:34.080
where did the body

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.159
in your chart

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:37.399
come from?

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:39.440
I'm not sure.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.600
It was given by my father.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.240
Is there something wrong?

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:44.919
No.

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:47.600
It's just that the person who drew it

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:48.759
had astonishing skill.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.350
I've been a coroner for many years
and never seen anything like it.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.639
I was only asking.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:53.799
Go heat the vinegar broth.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:54.759
I'll sort the remains.

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:16.440
How was a chart like that

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:18.000
made?

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.639
Wu Jiang.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:30.279
Your Highness.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:33.880
Does it look like me?

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:39.039
It does.

00:12:44.039 --> 00:12:44.600
Does it?

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:45.679
It does.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:47.919
What about this one?

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:49.720
It does.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.879
Well, well.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.679
Just speak plainly, Your Highness.

00:12:54.919 --> 00:12:56.240
You're making me confused.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.679
I'll take my leave.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.679
Did I get the proportions wrong

00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:09.320
and end up drawing myself?

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.960
First Prince, he's hiding
in the Three Judicial Offices

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.039
and hasn't come out.

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:39.600
Three Judicial Offices?

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.159
Trash is still trash.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.840
He's so afraid of me
that he hides there.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.159
I enjoy seeing him

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:52.240
like a stray dog.

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:53.960
How could a lowborn

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.480
compare to Your Highness?

00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:57.360
My dear little brother

00:13:58.399 --> 00:13:59.799
is wild and hard to tame.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.559
If I don't crush him,

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.039
he'll become a great threat one day.

00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:06.519
Are you saying...

00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:08.840
What should we do next?

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.380
He's hiding
in the Three Judicial Offices.

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:11.490
We can't touch him easily.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.990
Father has ordered me
to prepare for the Jiaozhou campaign.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.799
During this time,

00:14:18.039 --> 00:14:19.480
we can't move against You Chen'an.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.240
Let him live a few more days.

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:24.799
I'll deal with him when I find time.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.120
Anything else?

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.960
Thanks to these case records,
everything is written so clearly.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.440
Every detail is easy to understand.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.320
To be honest,

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.559
you can understand them

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.039
because you know coroner skills.

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:46.639
I do?

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.600
Of course.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.240
Compared to those professional coroners,

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:51.679
you're not inferior at all.

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:55.200
His Highness is eager
for capable coroners,

00:14:55.919 --> 00:14:57.720
so he had me take on apprentices.

00:14:58.679 --> 00:15:00.559
And I think among all of them,

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.440
you're the smartest

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.279
and the best.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.360
My judgment is never wrong.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.720
You should have faith in yourself.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.879
Thank you....

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.519
Thank you for your recognition.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.159
At this pace,

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.320
before long,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.519
I think

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:17.960
you'll even be able to assist
His Highness in my place.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.639
Keep up the good work.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.440
That won't do.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.600
I mustn't steal what another holds dear.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.720
Even back in Nanzhao,

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.399
I heard

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.000
the love story
between you and Commandery Prince An.

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:33.759
I have a copy of it.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.240
I didn't bring it today.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.360
Those are just made-up stories.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.570
There's no need to take them seriously.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.679
Master Shenguan is here.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.540
- Your Reverence.
- Your Reverence.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.240
- Your Reverence.
- Your Reverence.

00:16:09.919 --> 00:16:10.440
Make way!

00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:11.759
Make way!

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.879
What are you doing?

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.190
Why are you bumping into people?

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.720
He moved!

00:16:24.159 --> 00:16:25.919
Vice Minister Jing, he moved!

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.399
After days of rituals in the temple,
he finally moved.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:29.879
Where did he go?

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:31.190
Today is the first day of the month.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.799
There are too many people there praying.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.360
You lost him?

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:35.559
What are you doing here?

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.020
Send people to search along the route.

00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:37.460
Yes, sir.

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:45.279
Sir,

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:46.600
a letter from Peacock.

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:52.000
Peacock showed up?

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:52.759
Yes.

00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:56.960
"A martyr will emerge.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.159
You will meet the Tang Emperor

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.480
and stir up trouble through this

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.280
and blame it on
the Three Judicial Offices."

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:06.079
A martyr?

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.140
(West Market)

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.390
Your Highness, we searched
the entire East Market.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:12.839
Nothing.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.330
We also checked near the Music Office.

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.020
Your Highness,
we've been searching for two hours.

00:17:16.039 --> 00:17:17.200
There's no trace at all.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.960
It's been two hours.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.990
No matter what he did,
he must've returned to the temple.

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:21.920
I'll go take a look.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.840
I've already sent people
to keep watch there.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:24.839
Keep looking.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:25.890
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:26.519
Move.

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:44.319
Do you see that young monk?

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.400
His name is Jing Yuan.

00:17:45.759 --> 00:17:47.759
He's the last disciple
of Master Shenguan.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.540
(The cart sinks.)

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.920
(He seems down.)

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.160
(All of Master Shenguan are here,)

00:17:56.559 --> 00:17:57.720
(except him.)

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.279
Oh, merciful Buddha.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.119
Commandery Prince An.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.359
Oh, merciful Buddha.

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:15.079
Have any of you seen the Eminent Monk?

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.990
I wish to invite His Reverence
to the Three Judicial Offices

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.759
to conduct a rite.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.720
We haven't seen His Reverence.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.160
Monk Jing Yuan is his last disciple.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.920
Why isn't he with him?

00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:28.759
In a monk's eyes,

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:29.960
all beings are equal.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.799
Apart from daily care,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.319
Jing Yuan is never treated differently
in his cultivation.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.319
Monk Jing Yuan.

00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:37.960
Your Highness.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.799
We are monks of Nanzhao.

00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:43.470
We only came out to buy firewood.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.359
Why are we being questioned
like criminals?

00:18:46.599 --> 00:18:48.119
That firewood

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.920
is all dead branches.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:51.599
Why don't we buy you some new ones?

00:18:51.759 --> 00:18:52.480
No need!

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.000
Master,

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.839
there are prayer charms
pressed under the wood.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.799
That would be disrespectful.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.319
Wu Jiang.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.559
Surround them.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.519
Your Highness, what is this about?

00:19:18.599 --> 00:19:19.119
Stop!

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.160
Your Highness.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.519
(Capital Prefecture)

00:19:43.519 --> 00:19:43.920
Sir!

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:44.960
Sir!

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.279
Sir!

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.480
What are you yelling for?

00:19:48.759 --> 00:19:50.000
Are you summoning spirits?

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.599
Vice Minister Huang of Rites is here.

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:54.200
He's waiting in the second hall.

00:19:56.519 --> 00:19:57.519
What does he want?

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.319
I heard

00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.440
Commandery Consort An

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.990
arrested a group of monks
from Weiguo Temple right on the street.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.720
What?

00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:06.039
That troublemaker is at it again.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.319
What are you waiting for?

00:20:09.559 --> 00:20:10.119
Go.

00:20:10.279 --> 00:20:11.039
Bring the new tea

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.079
and brazier over.

00:20:12.119 --> 00:20:12.680
Quick.

00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:13.500
Yes, sir.

00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:25.720
Vice Minister Huang.

00:20:29.119 --> 00:20:29.880
Vice Minister Huang.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.359
Lord Jiang.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.319
The yamen has been swamped with work.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.610
I should've welcomed you earlier.

00:20:36.039 --> 00:20:36.799
Vice Minister,

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:37.880
please sit.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.440
No need.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.119
The Ministry of Rites is even busier.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.359
I came here on urgent business

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.799
and need your help.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.400
Please speak, Vice Minister Huang.

00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:51.519
As long as it falls under
the Capital Prefecture,

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.279
I'll do my best.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.480
I suppose you haven't heard yet.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.519
Commandery Prince An's arrest
of the Weiguo Temple monks

00:20:59.839 --> 00:21:02.119
has spread all over Chang'an.

00:21:02.279 --> 00:21:03.960
The rumors are raging.

00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:06.319
Many foreign envoys
are devout believers,

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.460
and they've started questioning
the Ministry of Rites.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.279
Lord Jiang, I hope

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.920
you can calm things down quickly.

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:17.839
The one making arrests

00:21:18.359 --> 00:21:20.000
is Commandery Prince An.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.559
We have no power over him.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.880
The arrests were made by
the Three Judicial Offices,

00:21:28.279 --> 00:21:30.160
but the rumors are being spread

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:33.119
by people under the capital's rule.

00:21:33.799 --> 00:21:36.079
If His Majesty
holds someone responsible,

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.440
Lord Jiang,

00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:39.640
will you be able to stay out of it?

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:41.640
Of course.

00:21:42.039 --> 00:21:42.599
Of course.

00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:45.200
Though our authority is limited,

00:21:45.319 --> 00:21:48.039
we will do what we can.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.440
Then, I'll trouble you with that.

00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:54.720
He was perfectly healthy,

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.720
yet he suddenly died

00:21:56.759 --> 00:21:59.400
on the way back from performing a ritual
at the Zhao Residence.

00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:02.319
And it happened
just when we had begun to suspect him

00:22:02.359 --> 00:22:03.559
and were about to investigate.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.400
That's far too convenient.

00:22:05.519 --> 00:22:07.519
I don't believe he has nothing to do
with Peacock.

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:10.680
By the way,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.200
how did the woman
who met with Master Shenguan

00:22:13.279 --> 00:22:14.000
turn out?

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.039
Good thing you remind me.

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:15.700
I just checked.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.160
Tell me.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.720
What's your connection
to Master Shenguan?

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.839
(Qinxiang, musician)

00:22:23.839 --> 00:22:25.079
What master?

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.359
I

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.240
don't know any master.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.119
If you don't know him,
why are you so nervous?

00:22:33.079 --> 00:22:33.880
What about him?

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:35.519
Do you find him familiar?

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.079
Yes, he looks a little familiar.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.480
Maybe he's a customer
who came to listen to the music.

00:22:43.799 --> 00:22:44.880
Let me jog your memory.

00:22:45.319 --> 00:22:46.079
A few days ago,

00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:48.240
he came here specially to see you.

00:22:49.279 --> 00:22:50.559
Oh, I remember.

00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:52.640
He came to listen to music.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.240
So you two were close, weren't you?

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.000
No.

00:22:55.079 --> 00:22:55.839
Absolutely not.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.079
That guest

00:22:57.279 --> 00:22:58.640
is a proper gentleman.

00:22:59.559 --> 00:23:00.359
How could he

00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:02.720
have any improper contact with me?

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.200
How do you know
he was a proper gentleman?

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:06.880
Didn't you say you didn't know him?

00:23:08.319 --> 00:23:09.880
She won't say anything else.

00:23:11.319 --> 00:23:12.920
Everything she says

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.759
is defending Master Shenguan.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.200
I reckon,

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:19.000
if Master Shenguan and Qinxiang

00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:20.519
had some secret dealings,

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.079
there must be something
we don't know behind it.

00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:26.839
Master Shenguan just finished a ritual
for Consort Hui,

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.000
and now it concerns the Zhao Residence.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.640
If something else is involved,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.160
the implications run deep.

00:23:33.559 --> 00:23:35.599
Could it be that we moved too openly

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.119
and alerted someone,

00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:38.680
so they decided to sacrifice him

00:23:38.839 --> 00:23:39.799
to cover their tracks?

00:23:41.039 --> 00:23:42.839
If even someone like him
can be discarded...

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.599
You'd better be extremely careful
from now on.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.240
Master Shenguan was highly respected.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.799
Nanzhao revered him as an eminent monk,

00:23:57.079 --> 00:23:58.610
and he was famous in Great Tang as well.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.960
If he really had ties to Peacock,

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.119
the forces behind it must be enormous.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.559
One wrong step

00:24:05.079 --> 00:24:06.680
could escalate diplomatic tensions.

00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:08.839
Public anger is rising everywhere.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.400
That would only hurt Great Tang.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.359
We mustn't alert them.

00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:15.920
Just now, they claimed

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.160
Master Shenguan died suddenly,

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.359
but I can tell they're hiding something.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:22.960
And that young monk, Jing Yuan,

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.710
he clearly had something to say to you,

00:24:24.839 --> 00:24:26.759
but Wu Nian stopped him from speaking.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.400
Leave this to me.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.390
The matter came up so suddenly.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.710
We apologize for disturbing you.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.990
The Three Judicial Offices have prepared
a vegetarian meal.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:49.880
Please.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.020
(Zhao Residence)

00:25:55.119 --> 00:25:55.880
Vice Minister Jing.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.680
Lady Jing.

00:25:57.119 --> 00:25:58.960
What brings you here?

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.200
A few days ago, my father told me

00:26:01.319 --> 00:26:02.519
to pay Aunt a visit.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:03.680
I'm to blame.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:04.780
I've been tied up with official duties.

00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:05.980
But I finally found the time.

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:07.599
Hurry and tell Madam

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.490
that Vice Minister Jing
and Lady Jing are here.

00:26:09.519 --> 00:26:09.880
Yes.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.400
Does Father know

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.490
you've been using his name
to do all these things outside?

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.880
It's by His Highness's order.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.279
This way,

00:26:19.599 --> 00:26:19.880
please.

00:26:38.039 --> 00:26:38.400
Yes.

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:44.240
Monk Jing Yuan, the food...

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.319
Monk Jing Yuan!

00:26:48.519 --> 00:26:49.039
Jing Yuan!

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:49.540
Your Highness!

00:26:49.559 --> 00:26:49.950
Jing Yuan!

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.000
Monk Jing Yuan has fainted.

00:26:51.079 --> 00:26:51.480
Quick.

00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:53.000
Take him inside to rest.

00:26:53.039 --> 00:26:53.400
Yes.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.039
Look at the hills and flowing water.

00:26:56.079 --> 00:26:57.359
Petals are falling all around.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.559
It feels like a hidden paradise,

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.319
doesn't it, Madam?

00:27:02.559 --> 00:27:03.519
Indeed.

00:27:04.279 --> 00:27:05.519
I've traveled to many places

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.000
and seen countless landscapes.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.680
But scenery like this

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.680
still makes my heart feel light.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.880
Thank you.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.090
Your Highness.

00:27:37.599 --> 00:27:38.279
You're awake.

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:42.240
You fainted from emotional shock.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.039
You may rest here for a while.

00:27:45.759 --> 00:27:46.200
Sir!

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:48.759
Please help me.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.880
I've followed my master since childhood.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.400
He was like a father to me.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.799
Now that he died so suddenly.

00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:56.680
I beg you to find the truth

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.000
and give him justice.

00:27:58.359 --> 00:27:59.240
Could you

00:27:59.759 --> 00:28:01.440
tell me everything

00:28:01.599 --> 00:28:02.319
in detail?

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.759
When I went inside,

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.519
Master told me
to wait in the guest hall.

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:09.590
I don't know what happened afterward.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.920
Oh, merciful Buddha.

00:28:25.119 --> 00:28:26.480
Your Highness, what is this?

00:28:26.599 --> 00:28:27.960
Masters, please don't be nervous.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.119
The Three Judicial Offices

00:28:30.359 --> 00:28:31.519
are like Buddhism.

00:28:32.119 --> 00:28:33.039
We value the truth

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.599
above all else.

00:28:37.079 --> 00:28:39.319
You six are fellow disciples.

00:28:39.839 --> 00:28:41.759
You came together
and returned together.

00:28:42.039 --> 00:28:44.650
So your accounts of what happened
when Master Shenguan passed away

00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:46.079
shouldn't differ.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.000
Oh, merciful Buddha.

00:28:48.119 --> 00:28:49.880
Oh, merciful Buddha.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.759
Now, I ask you all

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.119
to sit separately,

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.640
facing the wall.

00:28:55.559 --> 00:28:57.279
Please write down everything
that happened

00:28:57.559 --> 00:28:58.839
from the moment

00:28:59.319 --> 00:29:00.920
you left the temple

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.119
until you met me.

00:29:04.759 --> 00:29:06.000
It's only been half a day.

00:29:07.359 --> 00:29:08.559
Your memories

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.000
should still be clear.

00:29:10.759 --> 00:29:12.160
If anyone's account

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.599
is far shorter than the others,

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:16.279
it suggests deliberate concealment.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.640
The Three Judicial Offices

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.359
will look into it closely.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.559
Aunt, you're kind and beautiful.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.680
It's been so long.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.720
You look even younger than last time.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.400
You sweet-talker.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.880
I don't know who you take after.

00:29:32.279 --> 00:29:34.960
Come visit more often
when you have time.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.599
As long as you don't mind,

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.000
I'd love to.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.559
Aunt,

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.720
is there a funeral here?

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.640
Aunt,

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.359
I speak bluntly.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.610
Please don't take it to heart.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.079
Just now, I smelled

00:29:52.119 --> 00:29:54.359
a lot of incense in the courtyard,

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.079
so I thought you were mourning someone.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:57.880
Really?

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.519
Did something happen?

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:01.480
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.700
We should've gone home
and told my parents right away.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:04.839
No, no.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.079
I only picked

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.519
an auspicious day
to hold a blessing ritual.

00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:11.480
Don't tell me you invited

00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:13.160
Master Shenguan from Weiguo Temple

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.519
and his six disciples?

00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:16.319
How did you know?

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.160
The whole street was talking about it
when we came.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.240
They said Commandery Prince An
stopped six monks in the street

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.279
and found Master Shenguan's body.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.200
They were taken for questioning.

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:27.519
What?

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.559
Your Highness, Monk Jing Yuan is back.

00:30:33.839 --> 00:30:35.160
- Jing Yuan.
- Jing Yuan.

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:35.890
Are you all right?

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.500
Are you all right, Jing Yuan?

00:30:38.279 --> 00:30:38.920
Let me check.

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:42.359
Apart from the usual offerings,

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.190
you also took extra money
when you were in the Zhao Residence.

00:30:46.119 --> 00:30:47.200
I remember

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.920
when Master Shenguan arrived,

00:30:49.079 --> 00:30:50.440
he already looked unwell.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.119
Then on the way back,
he suffered from the heat,

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.680
and that's how this happened.

00:30:55.359 --> 00:30:56.000
I suppose,

00:30:56.039 --> 00:30:56.590
the monks

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.190
must've been worried that there were
too many eyes on the street

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.160
and that it might
bring gossip to the temple,

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.160
so

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.100
they hid Master Shenguan's body
in a load of firewood.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.880
That must've been very on them.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.200
I feel sorry for them.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.599
I really do.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.000
Aunt.

00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:17.160
I don't think Jing Yi mentioned

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:18.599
where the body was hidden.

00:31:24.839 --> 00:31:25.599
Aunt,

00:31:26.279 --> 00:31:27.759
what happened?

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.680
You know how tense things are
between Nanzhao and Great Tang.

00:31:32.119 --> 00:31:33.000
Vice Minister Zhao

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:34.750
works in the Ministry of Rites,
doesn't he?

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:36.839
If anything goes wrong,

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.160
it could implicate your entire clan.

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:46.480
It was because

00:31:46.519 --> 00:31:48.799
of what happened
in Consort Hui's palace last time.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.960
I thought

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.759
I should invite Master Shenguan

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.480
to perform a blessing ritual at home.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.240
First,

00:31:57.519 --> 00:31:59.279
to drive away bad luck.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.880
Second,

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.680
to pray for Her Highness's

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.079
well-being.

00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:08.960
But just as the ritual was ending,

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.640
Master Shenguan suddenly collapsed,

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.400
as if struck by lightning.

00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:20.119
- When we rushed to him,
- Master!

00:32:20.519 --> 00:32:21.960
- Master!
- Master!

00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:24.160
he had already stopped breathing.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.319
Master!

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.319
- He didn't leave a single word behind.
- Master!

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.279
So

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.200
Master Shenguan died suddenly

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.079
during the ritual?

00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:38.519
This is a serious matter.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.359
Why did the Zhao Residence try
to cover it up?

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.440
Madam Zhao was beside herself
with grief.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.200
She was afraid Master Shenguan's death
would bring bad luck,

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.599
so she begged us
not to let the news spread.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.839
Bad luck?

00:32:50.599 --> 00:32:51.759
My husband

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.400
is an official of the Ministry of Rites.

00:32:54.759 --> 00:32:56.480
If the words get out,

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.319
who knows how the court
will talk about it?

00:33:01.839 --> 00:33:03.319
Besides, Consort Hui and he

00:33:03.599 --> 00:33:06.079
are siblings.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.759
Forgive my bluntness,

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.440
if His Majesty

00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:12.640
were to take offense

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:14.079
because of this,

00:33:15.559 --> 00:33:17.759
the entire Zhao family,

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:19.400
the Jiang family,

00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:21.799
perhaps even the Jing family,

00:33:22.079 --> 00:33:24.359
could all be involved.

00:33:29.119 --> 00:33:31.400
That's why you took hush money
from the Zhao Residence?

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.790
Though Master Shenguan
was from Nanzhao,

00:33:38.319 --> 00:33:39.720
he treated all beings alike.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.670
After coming to the capital,
he worked day and night

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.079
to guide the people of Great Tang.

00:33:43.599 --> 00:33:44.680
I can't bear the thought

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.759
that his passing hides another truth

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.240
that will never be made known.

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:49.599
The Zhao family promised

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.759
a large donation to the temple

00:33:52.599 --> 00:33:53.920
and secretly gave us

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.519
some gold pieces as well,

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.160
asking us not to spread word
that our master died

00:33:58.559 --> 00:33:59.440
in the Zhao Residence.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.079
Jing Yuan...

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:00.720
Senior,

00:34:01.359 --> 00:34:02.759
I know all you said.

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:04.200
But Master...

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.720
How could he pass away

00:34:07.359 --> 00:34:08.679
so suddenly?

00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:19.679
Please forgive us for hiding this,
Your Highness.

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:23.280
- Oh, merciful Buddha.
- Oh, merciful Buddha.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:26.590
This wasn't only for the Zhao family,

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.559
but also for Nanzhao

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:29.360
and Great Tang.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.840
We monks

00:34:31.039 --> 00:34:32.400
don't dwell on the past,

00:34:33.039 --> 00:34:35.320
but now envoys from all lands
are gathered in Chang'an.

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:37.920
Just the other day,
when the Ministry of Rites came,

00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:40.639
Lord Gao treated Master
with great respect.

00:34:41.119 --> 00:34:43.000
Now that Master has suddenly passed,

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.519
I feared some might take advantage of it

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:46.920
and bring disaster to the temple,

00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:48.660
disturbing peace
between the two countries.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:50.679
That's why I agreed to
the Zhao family's request,

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.480
planning to return quietly
to the temple

00:34:52.559 --> 00:34:55.039
and inform the abbot
before we decide what to do.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.960
That was all the Zhao family asked of you?

00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.480
Yes.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.559
Did we miss anything in our statements?

00:35:07.159 --> 00:35:08.320
You all

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.199
wrote the same words.

00:35:12.639 --> 00:35:13.440
Your Highness,

00:35:13.559 --> 00:35:16.239
how did you know we had hush money
in our sleeves?

00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:18.360
When you were kneeling
and writing just now,

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:19.960
your sleeves kept rising and falling,

00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:21.480
or dragging on the floor.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.320
You were so focused on your words

00:35:24.719 --> 00:35:25.960
that you failed to notice.

00:35:26.079 --> 00:35:28.920
It's well known that Master Shenguan
was strict with his disciples.

00:35:29.159 --> 00:35:31.119
A novice like Monk Jing Yuan

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.190
would surely keep the rules
against handling money.

00:35:33.239 --> 00:35:34.519
Offerings for this rite

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.119
should've been sent directly
to the temple hall.

00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:40.000
Yet each of you had money
hidden in your sleeves.

00:35:40.159 --> 00:35:42.800
That could only be the Zhao family
forcing hush money upon you.

00:35:45.039 --> 00:35:46.960
- Oh, merciful Buddha.
- Oh, merciful Buddha.

00:36:04.239 --> 00:36:05.079
Butler Zhao,

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.360
I do love flowers,

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.800
but I'm too clumsy

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.920
to keep them alive.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.719
When I saw this rose today,

00:36:15.159 --> 00:36:17.159
it felt as though it had taken root
in my heart.

00:36:17.639 --> 00:36:19.480
May I trouble Aunt

00:36:19.679 --> 00:36:21.519
to give it to me?

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.519
Oh dear, how foolish of me.

00:36:23.559 --> 00:36:25.239
My wife loves roses.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.920
I should've asked Aunt myself.

00:36:27.239 --> 00:36:28.360
Please don't say that, sir.

00:36:28.559 --> 00:36:29.519
Madam says

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.360
flowers are all about fate.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.199
Since Lady Jing likes it,

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.480
it's the flower's good fortune.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.320
Please take it.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.519
Then I'll gladly accept it.

00:36:43.719 --> 00:36:44.639
Thank you, Butler Zhao.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.190
You're welcome.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.590
- Thanks to Aunt.
- You're welcome.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.910
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.400
Please.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:50.280
Please.

00:36:51.719 --> 00:36:53.119
Could you please think carefully

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.440
once more?

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.719
Before Master Shenguan passed,

00:36:58.159 --> 00:36:59.599
was there no sign at all,

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.519
nothing unusual,

00:37:01.639 --> 00:37:02.360
or

00:37:02.519 --> 00:37:04.000
nothing suspicious?

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.199
Master was always strong

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.719
and had no illness.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.880
We honestly don't know

00:37:09.039 --> 00:37:10.280
why he passed away so suddenly.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.920
Perhaps Master

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.480
saw the truth of all things

00:37:16.599 --> 00:37:17.800
and left the mortal world.

00:37:19.119 --> 00:37:20.920
Did he ever make enemies in life?

00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:21.880
No.

00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:25.320
We monks devote ourselves to good deeds
and treat all with kindness.

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.480
Master never held grudges.

00:37:26.519 --> 00:37:28.039
When all the foreign envoys came

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.400
to the Weiguo Temple the other day,

00:37:29.519 --> 00:37:30.400
did the Nanzhao envoy

00:37:30.679 --> 00:37:32.920
ever meet Master Shenguan alone?

00:37:33.159 --> 00:37:35.599
Officials of Great Tang were always with him.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.000
There was no private meeting.

00:37:42.679 --> 00:37:43.280
Sir,

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.800
something has happened.

00:37:45.039 --> 00:37:46.239
Commandery Prince An found

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.900
Master Shenguan's body
in the West Market.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:48.679
