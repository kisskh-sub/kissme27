Ms. Li,

00:03:06.906 --> 00:03:08.107
I'm really putting on weight.

00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:10.987
Don't believe me?
Let me get on the scale, so you can see.

00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:14.746
Alright. But remember,
the plan was to gain at least 2.5 kilos.

00:03:14.987 --> 00:03:15.706
No problem.

00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:30.026
It's 68 kilos.

00:03:31.547 --> 00:03:32.267
- Meng.
- No way.

00:03:32.267 --> 00:03:34.787
- What was Mr. Lin's prior weight?
- It was 70.5 kilos.

00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:37.107
See? You've lost weight.

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:38.227
Stop looking.

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:39.347
This can't be right.

00:03:39.507 --> 00:03:41.947
I eat five meals a day. How could I...

00:03:41.947 --> 00:03:43.426
Your face has even sunken in.

00:03:43.827 --> 00:03:44.626
Exactly.

00:03:44.706 --> 00:03:46.507
Right. Five full meals every day.

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:48.426
We even prepared his five meals
on schedule.

00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:48.987
Right.

00:03:49.107 --> 00:03:50.026
See? Right?

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:53.586
Yes.

00:03:54.706 --> 00:03:56.706
You did lose weight.
Why did you become so thin?

00:03:57.107 --> 00:03:58.347
Tan, what do you think?

00:03:58.866 --> 00:03:59.366
Me?

00:03:59.626 --> 00:04:01.507
My eyesight's bad. I can't see clearly.

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:02.706
- Xie.
- No weight gained.

00:04:03.107 --> 00:04:03.787
- Impossible.
- Target not met.

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:04.947
Impossible. Impossible.

00:04:05.067 --> 00:04:07.667
I... I couldn't have lost weight.

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:08.866
I've been...

00:04:08.987 --> 00:04:11.026
What's in your pockets?

00:04:11.787 --> 00:04:12.547
Nothing there.

00:04:12.626 --> 00:04:13.146
Get him.

00:04:13.287 --> 00:04:13.787
Nothing.

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:14.626
Come on.

00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:15.366
Search him.

00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:16.866
What are you doing?

00:04:16.907 --> 00:04:17.688
Following orders.

00:04:18.266 --> 00:04:19.426
Resist and we'll tickle you.

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:20.227
Stop it.

00:04:20.746 --> 00:04:21.426
Stop it.

00:04:22.587 --> 00:04:23.707
Let go.

00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:24.547
Don't resist.

00:04:24.626 --> 00:04:25.506
Just bear with it.

00:04:25.547 --> 00:04:26.707

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:28.107

00:04:29.147 --> 00:04:29.667
I...

00:04:29.787 --> 00:04:30.907
Why are you unbuttoning me?

00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:32.587
Nothing to hide, so why panic?

00:04:32.707 --> 00:04:33.266
Right.

00:04:33.347 --> 00:04:34.186
You're guilty.

00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:35.306
Something's inside.

00:04:35.426 --> 00:04:35.946
Look.

00:04:39.426 --> 00:04:39.987
Heavy stuff.

00:04:43.347 --> 00:04:43.866
What's this?

00:04:44.746 --> 00:04:45.386
What's this?

00:04:45.506 --> 00:04:46.386
So heavy?

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:47.186
You really...

00:04:49.306 --> 00:04:50.027
You seem honest.

00:04:51.547 --> 00:04:52.587
No need to get angry.

00:04:54.386 --> 00:04:56.066
Let's go. Stop looking.

00:04:59.066 --> 00:04:59.826
To be honest,

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:03.907
well, I think
he has put on a bit of weight.

00:05:04.107 --> 00:05:05.667
Plus the weight of these nuts,

00:05:05.946 --> 00:05:07.066
how could he still...

00:05:09.107 --> 00:05:10.667
Just simple physics.

00:05:11.587 --> 00:05:12.587

00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:15.826
Ms. Li, that's what Mr. Zheng would do.

00:05:16.147 --> 00:05:18.386
When did you learn to be so sneaky?

00:05:19.907 --> 00:05:21.306
Ms. Li is quite impressive.

00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:23.886
- Did you see that?
- She has potential.

00:05:24.547 --> 00:05:26.407
Knowledge is power. Understand?

00:05:26.987 --> 00:05:28.066
Don't ever offend Ms. Li.

00:05:30.626 --> 00:05:31.126
Take these.

00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:32.728
No one would dare offend her.

00:05:34.347 --> 00:05:35.506
Qingtian, take it back.

00:05:35.766 --> 00:05:36.266
Okay.

00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:38.087
It's heavy. Let me check out the weight.

00:05:38.306 --> 00:05:38.806
Alright.

00:05:38.987 --> 00:05:40.426
Just let me go back.

00:05:40.847 --> 00:05:42.306
Master, just listen to Mr. Zheng.

00:05:42.347 --> 00:05:44.306
He is doing this for your health.

00:05:44.547 --> 00:05:46.527
I'm fully recovered, Mr. Zheng.

00:05:46.707 --> 00:05:48.907
I haven't been to the site in ages.
I'm anxious.

00:05:48.946 --> 00:05:51.866
Besides, with the hospital's
wiring unfinished, how can I rest easy?

00:05:51.946 --> 00:05:54.467
Yu, hear him?
Your master doesn't trust your work.

00:05:54.547 --> 00:05:55.587
That's not what I meant.

00:05:55.626 --> 00:05:56.426
You meant that.

00:05:56.686 --> 00:05:58.547
Mr. Zheng,
that's not what my master meant.

00:05:58.547 --> 00:06:00.347
- Your master meant exactly that.
- He's just worried about the wiring.

00:06:00.594 --> 00:06:02.107
Who'll you help? Stand here.

00:06:02.587 --> 00:06:03.227
Don't move.

00:06:05.426 --> 00:06:06.826
I'll show you who's boss.

00:06:07.306 --> 00:06:08.707
Mr. Zheng, be gentle.

00:06:11.266 --> 00:06:11.766
Mr. Zheng.

00:06:15.547 --> 00:06:17.667
Mr. Zheng! What are you doing?

00:06:38.107 --> 00:06:38.907
Without my order,

00:06:39.266 --> 00:06:41.027
no one opens that door for him.
Understood?

00:06:41.506 --> 00:06:42.266
Rest assured.

00:06:44.587 --> 00:06:46.266
You are very childish.

00:06:56.506 --> 00:06:57.496
Who are you looking for?

00:07:01.027 --> 00:07:01.907
I'd like to see

00:07:01.946 --> 00:07:03.866
Li Qiuping, mayor of Yuehai Town.

00:07:06.107 --> 00:07:08.506
She isn't in.
What did you need to see her about?

00:07:08.787 --> 00:07:11.787
The thing is, my superior asked me
to deliver something to her.

00:07:13.907 --> 00:07:14.746
Let me see.

00:07:24.227 --> 00:07:27.266
This letter introduces Du Tao,
a reporter from our publication.

00:07:27.426 --> 00:07:31.107
(Letter of Introduction)
Assigned to establish the Yuehai Column,

00:07:31.386 --> 00:07:36.066
he will conduct research and interviews
at your location. For one year?

00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:48.907
Mr. Hailuo.

00:07:49.907 --> 00:07:50.426
Xiaoli,

00:07:51.186 --> 00:07:52.987
why are you dressed like that today?

00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:54.227
Looks good?

00:08:10.186 --> 00:08:11.686
Ms. Xiao, get me some food.

00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:14.167
(Today's menu)
You...

00:08:15.946 --> 00:08:16.446
Mr. Zheng.

00:08:20.386 --> 00:08:22.866
Meng Xiaoli, are you okay?

00:08:26.787 --> 00:08:27.386
Mr. Zheng.

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:30.227
Well? Does it look good?

00:08:31.147 --> 00:08:33.304
I went to the Sunshine Barber Shop
to have Lili do it.

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.786
Why are you dressed like this?

00:08:37.386 --> 00:08:39.187
Isn't Reporter Du coming soon?

00:08:39.947 --> 00:08:41.587
Shouldn't I tidy up to look presentable?

00:08:41.947 --> 00:08:43.707
What does his visit have to do with you?

00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:45.467
Reporter Du has a camera with him.

00:08:45.947 --> 00:08:47.866
He'll definitely take photos of us.

00:08:48.026 --> 00:08:51.064
If my dusty face gets in the newspaper,
people in the province will see it.

00:08:51.227 --> 00:08:53.187
But you don't need
to dress like a monster.

00:08:54.506 --> 00:08:57.467
Look at that red lip of yours.
It looks like you just ate someone.

00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.107
Wash that off immediately.

00:09:00.307 --> 00:09:00.827
Mr. Zheng.

00:09:01.587 --> 00:09:02.146
Mr. Zheng.

00:09:03.067 --> 00:09:04.026
Mr. Zheng, look.

00:09:04.227 --> 00:09:05.626
Mr. Xie dressed up as well.

00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:06.227
You look nice.

00:09:07.626 --> 00:09:08.227
Really?

00:09:09.227 --> 00:09:10.587
Mr. Xie, you look nice too.

00:09:10.927 --> 00:09:11.427
Thank you.

00:09:11.427 --> 00:09:12.386
I always look like this.

00:09:12.906 --> 00:09:13.987
Xuemei dressed me well.

00:09:14.146 --> 00:09:16.146
Right, Xie does care about appearances.

00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:18.746
I care about the image
of our town government.

00:09:18.947 --> 00:09:19.447
Right.

00:09:19.546 --> 00:09:20.146
Mr. Tan.

00:09:20.847 --> 00:09:22.347
- Yes, Mr. Tan.
- Your hairstyle today...

00:09:22.506 --> 00:09:23.227
You are different.

00:09:23.746 --> 00:09:26.107
Just a slight touch-up
for the cadre image.

00:09:26.546 --> 00:09:27.786
So you two are

00:09:27.987 --> 00:09:29.886
also dressed up
because Reporter Du is coming?

00:09:30.266 --> 00:09:32.347
Mr. Tan is. And you need to get changed.

00:09:32.347 --> 00:09:34.187
- Right. It's a major newspaper.
- Here, take mine.

00:09:34.266 --> 00:09:35.386
How about you get changed?

00:09:35.626 --> 00:09:36.906
Come on, try this on.

00:09:36.906 --> 00:09:37.406
Go away.

00:09:37.506 --> 00:09:38.266
Try mine on.

00:09:38.307 --> 00:09:39.227
Stop being ridiculous.

00:09:39.587 --> 00:09:40.087
Mr. Tan.

00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:41.546
How do I look?

00:09:42.107 --> 00:09:44.947
Though your intention was good,
the execution was a bit over the top.

00:09:45.146 --> 00:09:45.646
Alright?

00:09:45.987 --> 00:09:46.666
It's fine.

00:09:46.827 --> 00:09:47.827
It's alright.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.274
(Work Hard, Build Yuehai Together.
Bold Exploration, Courageous Practice)

00:10:03.307 --> 00:10:04.067
Where's Mr. Lin?

00:10:06.266 --> 00:10:09.386
Well, Reporter Du

00:10:09.906 --> 00:10:12.666
is having a year-long in-depth interview

00:10:13.227 --> 00:10:13.987
in Yuehai.

00:10:14.987 --> 00:10:16.506
I assume everyone knows this.

00:10:17.786 --> 00:10:20.427
I specifically invited him
to our work meeting today,

00:10:20.707 --> 00:10:23.160
so he can conduct
in-depth investigations

00:10:23.192 --> 00:10:25.666
and get a firsthand understanding
of our work.

00:10:25.927 --> 00:10:26.427
- Okay?
- Welcome.

00:10:26.427 --> 00:10:27.067
Welcome.

00:10:27.107 --> 00:10:27.607
Good.

00:10:30.107 --> 00:10:31.026
Well arranged.

00:10:31.866 --> 00:10:32.366
Good.

00:10:32.386 --> 00:10:34.266
No need to be nervous, everyone.

00:10:34.427 --> 00:10:35.707
Just act normally, okay?

00:10:35.987 --> 00:10:36.487
Relax.

00:10:36.587 --> 00:10:38.107
Let's follow the usual procedure.

00:10:39.866 --> 00:10:42.107
First, bring up any work-related issues
you each have

00:10:42.227 --> 00:10:43.067
for discussion.

00:10:43.626 --> 00:10:44.307
Who goes first?

00:10:51.786 --> 00:10:52.707
Xie, you go first.

00:11:09.227 --> 00:11:09.987
Go ahead.

00:11:12.266 --> 00:11:14.166
I have no issues. You go.

00:11:15.707 --> 00:11:16.207
Me?

00:11:17.546 --> 00:11:19.026
I'm doing fine. No issues.

00:11:26.626 --> 00:11:27.906
Yu, you?

00:11:30.506 --> 00:11:33.107
Mr. Zheng, I also have no issues.

00:11:40.587 --> 00:11:42.006
Wait...

00:11:43.026 --> 00:11:44.067
With Reporter Du here,

00:11:44.827 --> 00:11:46.427
now you've all turned mute, huh?

00:11:47.187 --> 00:11:48.906
There are no issues, right?

00:11:49.006 --> 00:11:49.506
Right.

00:11:49.506 --> 00:11:50.386
It's a good thing.

00:11:50.506 --> 00:11:51.006
- Right.
- Right.

00:11:51.026 --> 00:11:52.146
Are you kidding me?

00:11:52.467 --> 00:11:53.146
Speak up.

00:11:53.146 --> 00:11:54.126
- Right.
- Speak.

00:11:54.587 --> 00:11:55.906
Let me out!

00:12:00.307 --> 00:12:00.807
Who's first?

00:12:00.947 --> 00:12:01.912
That's the only issue.

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:02.847
Just...

00:12:02.906 --> 00:12:03.746
What do you mean?

00:12:03.746 --> 00:12:04.386
Wait, this...

00:12:05.187 --> 00:12:05.746
Too talkative.

00:12:05.906 --> 00:12:06.587
Come on. No way.

00:12:06.666 --> 00:12:07.386
Is anyone there?

00:12:07.947 --> 00:12:08.866
Mr. Zheng!

00:12:09.506 --> 00:12:10.827
I need to get out!

00:12:11.347 --> 00:12:12.506
Nothing to say? You must...

00:12:12.506 --> 00:12:14.786
Mr. Zheng, is that Mr. Lin's voice?

00:12:15.427 --> 00:12:15.987
What's wrong?

00:12:16.067 --> 00:12:16.707
It's nothing.

00:12:17.266 --> 00:12:17.906
Ms. Li,

00:12:19.087 --> 00:12:22.347
Mr. Zheng locked my master in the room.

00:12:22.587 --> 00:12:23.827
Is anyone there?

00:12:25.386 --> 00:12:26.187
You can't say that.

00:12:26.427 --> 00:12:27.227
- Right.
- Actually...

00:12:27.506 --> 00:12:28.187
Well,

00:12:28.506 --> 00:12:30.987
Lin is stubborn and won't listen to us.

00:12:31.026 --> 00:12:32.184
He wanted to go to the site.

00:12:32.707 --> 00:12:34.546
We had a hard time dragging him back.

00:12:34.626 --> 00:12:37.427
And you locked him up?
That's violating personal freedom.

00:12:37.506 --> 00:12:38.107
No.

00:12:38.187 --> 00:12:40.026
You don't know him.
This is for his own good.

00:12:40.327 --> 00:12:42.107
It's fine.
Let's continue the meeting, okay?

00:12:42.207 --> 00:12:42.707
Let's go on.

00:12:42.707 --> 00:12:43.827
Mr. Zheng, where's the key?

00:12:47.827 --> 00:12:48.866
The key is with me.

00:12:49.947 --> 00:12:50.827
Give me the key.

00:12:56.107 --> 00:12:56.707
Give it to her.

00:12:58.026 --> 00:12:58.666
Alright then.

00:12:58.866 --> 00:13:00.307
Ms. Li, talk some sense into Lin.

00:13:00.386 --> 00:13:01.227
Give it to her.

00:13:01.786 --> 00:13:03.947
He can't ruin his health like this.

00:13:04.146 --> 00:13:04.866
Du. Du.

00:13:05.026 --> 00:13:05.947
Where are you going?

00:13:06.746 --> 00:13:07.947
You don't need to shoot this.

00:13:08.987 --> 00:13:09.487
Okay.

00:13:10.947 --> 00:13:11.906
Yes, sit tight.

00:13:11.987 --> 00:13:12.546
(Conference room)
You sit.

00:13:12.886 --> 00:13:13.386
Sit down.

00:13:13.386 --> 00:13:14.026
Please sit.

00:13:14.026 --> 00:13:14.546
Drink water.

00:13:14.546 --> 00:13:16.307
He's going to destroy his health.

00:13:16.307 --> 00:13:16.807
It's fine.

00:13:17.347 --> 00:13:19.546
Mr. Zheng, let me out!

00:13:20.847 --> 00:13:21.347
Is...

00:13:21.347 --> 00:13:21.866
I'm here.

00:13:28.506 --> 00:13:29.707
Mr. Lin, come out.

00:13:30.026 --> 00:13:32.987
You can go anywhere.
No one can restrict your freedom.

00:13:39.866 --> 00:13:40.386
Thank you.

00:13:40.707 --> 00:13:42.328
You can't go to the construction site.

00:13:52.626 --> 00:13:54.227
Then I'd rather stay inside.

00:14:02.786 --> 00:14:04.827
- Mr. Zheng, Ms. Li, I'll head off too.
- Alright, Liu.

00:14:04.987 --> 00:14:05.707
Just go.

00:14:07.067 --> 00:14:07.567
Let's go.

00:14:09.947 --> 00:14:10.447
How was it?

00:14:12.827 --> 00:14:15.666
After you opened the door,
did he tell you,

00:14:17.026 --> 00:14:19.707
"If I can't go to the site,
I'm not coming out"?

00:14:21.906 --> 00:14:22.467
Yes.

00:14:25.987 --> 00:14:26.707
Ms. Li,

00:14:28.707 --> 00:14:29.626
about Lin,

00:14:30.146 --> 00:14:31.587
I've known him for so many years.

00:14:32.067 --> 00:14:34.107
He truly throws himself
entirely into his work.

00:14:34.626 --> 00:14:37.187
For work, he'd literally give his life.

00:14:37.786 --> 00:14:39.746
So we have no choice.

00:14:42.427 --> 00:14:45.786
Excuse me. Does Mr. Lin have a wife?

00:14:46.906 --> 00:14:48.187
Come and sit over here.

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:49.026
Join us. Come on.

00:14:49.187 --> 00:14:49.687
Come on.

00:14:49.786 --> 00:14:50.626
Bring your camera.

00:14:50.626 --> 00:14:51.126
Come here.

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:51.947
Sit here.

00:14:52.067 --> 00:14:53.746
So, does Mr. Lin have a wife?

00:14:54.386 --> 00:14:57.146
Forget that. He's never even been
in a relationship

00:14:57.187 --> 00:14:58.187
at his age.

00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:01.266
Then I think his situation...

00:15:01.546 --> 00:15:02.947
Let me put it bluntly.

00:15:03.347 --> 00:15:06.866
Isn't he kind of lacking love?

00:15:07.587 --> 00:15:08.386
Lacking love?

00:15:10.067 --> 00:15:10.906
Then let's

00:15:11.827 --> 00:15:12.987
help him find some love.

00:15:14.227 --> 00:15:15.026
Lacking love?

00:15:17.146 --> 00:15:18.827
Why does it have to be love
that he lacks?

00:15:20.107 --> 00:15:21.866
What about iodine or common sense?

00:15:22.187 --> 00:15:23.906
I'm telling you,
your master lacks heart.

00:15:24.146 --> 00:15:27.727
His heart's full of work.
Nothing else gets in. Right?

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:28.987
It's tough.

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:30.227
Yes.

00:15:30.707 --> 00:15:32.987
I think Reporter Du's point is right.

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:34.827
But if Lin's issue

00:15:34.866 --> 00:15:37.107
is truly about romance,

00:15:37.386 --> 00:15:38.786
there's nothing we can do.

00:15:38.827 --> 00:15:39.666
We can only care.

00:15:40.347 --> 00:15:42.187
We need a long-term plan on this.

00:15:42.427 --> 00:15:44.347
That's nonsense.
You basically said nothing.

00:15:44.746 --> 00:15:46.386
We have no time for a long-term plan.

00:15:46.546 --> 00:15:47.506
We're swamped every day.

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:51.384
One day. Get it done by tomorrow.

00:15:51.647 --> 00:15:52.587
Action and results.

00:15:53.026 --> 00:15:54.866
- How can it be solved in a day?
- Alright.

00:15:54.866 --> 00:15:56.026
- It must be fast.
- Enough chatter.

00:15:56.026 --> 00:15:59.327
If anyone has ideas,
let's discuss them properly.

00:16:01.666 --> 00:16:04.506
What about Chen,
the amazing ping pong player?

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:05.427
Not nonsense again.

00:16:05.467 --> 00:16:07.386
What if she becomes
an Olympic champion later?

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:08.786
Stop playing matchmaker.

00:16:08.827 --> 00:16:11.427
She's way too young. Don't mess around.

00:16:11.707 --> 00:16:13.546
Her main focus isn't on romance, right?

00:16:13.707 --> 00:16:16.307
She's aiming for the provincial team.

00:16:16.347 --> 00:16:20.427
Then Lin Tofu would've hit the jackpot
with an Olympic champion.

00:16:21.666 --> 00:16:23.146
Lin Tofu. Lin Tofu.

00:16:24.347 --> 00:16:25.467
- Ms. Li.
- Mr. Xie.

00:16:25.626 --> 00:16:26.187
Look.

00:16:26.626 --> 00:16:29.307
Our town has very few people, right?

00:16:30.587 --> 00:16:31.146
Well,

00:16:31.546 --> 00:16:34.307
Meng and Yu lack dating experience.

00:16:34.707 --> 00:16:37.266
Mr. Xie has been married over 20 years,

00:16:37.266 --> 00:16:39.026
so his methods are outdated.

00:16:39.146 --> 00:16:40.146
We're still passionate.

00:16:40.827 --> 00:16:42.626
My wife passed early.

00:16:43.827 --> 00:16:44.386
Mr. Tan...

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:45.707
I'm not suitable.

00:16:46.107 --> 00:16:47.266
I know you're not.

00:16:47.347 --> 00:16:48.187
Not suitable.

00:16:49.107 --> 00:16:49.947
That leaves you.

00:16:50.587 --> 00:16:51.107
Me?

00:16:52.307 --> 00:16:54.146
What? What about me?

00:16:54.266 --> 00:16:55.506
You have experience.

00:16:55.827 --> 00:16:57.467
I have no experience.

00:16:57.786 --> 00:16:58.286
Right.

00:16:58.307 --> 00:17:00.947
I can testify
that she really has no experience.

00:17:01.026 --> 00:17:04.026
Because back then
when we got together, I pursued her.

00:17:04.786 --> 00:17:05.667
Perfect!

00:17:06.467 --> 00:17:07.147
So, Du,

00:17:07.346 --> 00:17:09.746
since you're so experienced,
you handle this task.

00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:10.707
Sit down. It's fine.

00:17:10.867 --> 00:17:11.947
Reporter Du,

00:17:12.227 --> 00:17:14.987
summarize your relationship experience
with Li.

00:17:15.306 --> 00:17:16.627
That should do it.

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:19.987
So you and Li will take the task.
It's settled then.

00:17:25.266 --> 00:17:27.387
How to solve Mr. Lin's problem?

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:30.826
Does Mr. Lin fall for someone?

00:17:31.627 --> 00:17:32.667
How would I know?

00:17:33.187 --> 00:17:35.187
He's always
running around construction sites.

00:17:35.546 --> 00:17:38.627
He probably has no chance
to meet single women.

00:17:39.106 --> 00:17:40.306
Perhaps you introduce someone?

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:42.227
Who do I know?

00:17:43.467 --> 00:17:44.987
Mr. Zheng said to you directly

00:17:45.227 --> 00:17:46.147
in person

00:17:46.467 --> 00:17:48.266
that this task is yours.

00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:49.667
His exact words were

00:17:49.746 --> 00:17:51.867
that we should both help on this.

00:17:52.066 --> 00:17:54.227
Also, Lin is the deputy mayor,
and you're the mayor.

00:17:54.227 --> 00:17:55.427
Can you really not help?

00:18:02.066 --> 00:18:02.627
Ms. Li,

00:18:03.306 --> 00:18:04.907
I'm totally new here.

00:18:04.947 --> 00:18:06.786
When will you show me around

00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:07.987
the Yuehai Town you've built?

00:18:08.867 --> 00:18:09.387
Tomorrow.

00:18:09.947 --> 00:18:11.306
Besides matchmaking for Mr. Lin,

00:18:11.467 --> 00:18:12.467
the most important thing

00:18:12.546 --> 00:18:14.907
is to give you a tour of Yuehai.

00:18:15.546 --> 00:18:16.046
Okay.

00:18:16.506 --> 00:18:19.707
I'll wait at your dorm door
at 8 AM tomorrow.

00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:20.786
8 AM?

00:18:22.026 --> 00:18:24.627
Reporter Du, do you think
this is the provincial capital?

00:18:26.967 --> 00:18:28.586
You packed quite thoroughly this time.

00:18:29.227 --> 00:18:31.096
Yes, I'm staying a whole year.

00:18:32.504 --> 00:18:33.266
Wonderful.

00:18:35.187 --> 00:18:36.504
We can see each other every day.

00:18:52.467 --> 00:18:54.546
The two paths I'll show you today

00:18:54.707 --> 00:18:56.066
are routes I walk every day.

00:18:57.387 --> 00:19:00.026
This one is especially quiet.

00:19:00.546 --> 00:19:03.306
In my heart, I call it Yue.

00:19:04.187 --> 00:19:04.707
Yue?

00:19:17.826 --> 00:19:20.227
Come and have a look!
Crisp and sweet big apples!

(Meat, Fruit)

00:19:26.506 --> 00:19:27.907
You buy them first. Okay?

00:19:28.266 --> 00:19:28.907
Thank you.

00:19:29.467 --> 00:19:29.967
Sir.

(Vegetables, Poultry)

00:19:36.627 --> 00:19:38.306
This street is bustling with activity.

00:19:38.306 --> 00:19:41.306
In my heart, I've named this street Hai.

00:19:42.346 --> 00:19:44.586
Every time I walk
on these two streets in Yuehai,

00:19:44.746 --> 00:19:46.467
my heart feels so full.

00:19:47.506 --> 00:19:49.467
Even though Yuehai is just a small town,

00:19:50.026 --> 00:19:52.266
I can already feel the vibe of a city.

00:19:52.746 --> 00:19:53.667
Ms. Li, you're here.

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:56.266
Tried this before?

00:19:56.746 --> 00:19:57.667
A bowl of sticky rice.

00:19:57.707 --> 00:19:58.467
Alright, a moment.

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:00.106
This is also very tasty.

00:20:00.427 --> 00:20:01.506
Okay, I'll give it a try.

00:20:04.546 --> 00:20:07.704
Qiuping, I understand
why you like this place.

00:20:08.152 --> 00:20:09.147
It's the people here.

00:20:11.707 --> 00:20:13.306
People are the foundation of a city.

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:17.147
How did you
suddenly become so sentimental?

00:20:17.746 --> 00:20:18.266

No, Mr. Lin.

You can't eat like this anymore.
Don't eat like this.

Mr. Lin, I understand how you feel.

You want to gain weight.

But your stomach
is still very delicate now.

00:22:45.947 --> 00:22:48.227
Keep eating like that,
and you'll end up in the hospital.

00:22:48.346 --> 00:22:49.656
You cannot go to the site then.

This isn't important.

00:23:05.647 --> 00:23:07.346
- Just check it out.
- The groundwater issue.

00:23:07.627 --> 00:23:08.627
How was it resolved?

00:23:09.266 --> 00:23:11.586
Did the road roller
have any more issues afterward?

00:23:11.707 --> 00:23:12.586

00:23:13.707 --> 00:23:16.266

00:27:35.867 --> 00:27:38.667
back when we first started printing,

00:28:48.346 --> 00:28:49.187
Reporter Du, hello.

00:28:49.346 --> 00:28:49.987
Hello.

00:28:50.026 --> 00:28:50.987
Hello, Reporter Du.

00:28:51.066 --> 00:28:52.427
I'm Wang Caixia.

00:28:52.627 --> 00:28:53.707
Right, Wang Caixia.

00:28:54.227 --> 00:28:54.987
You look lovely.

00:28:54.987 --> 00:28:55.707
I'm Xiaoyu.

00:28:55.707 --> 00:28:56.387
Here, please sit.

00:28:56.467 --> 00:28:58.266
This is the reception area.

00:28:59.026 --> 00:29:00.707
Come take a seat. Please sit.

00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:04.306
- Your outfit is really strange.
- So are your outfit.

00:29:04.306 --> 00:29:04.947
Why say so?

00:29:05.627 --> 00:29:07.346
- You dug it out from your trunk?
- What did you say?

00:29:07.506 --> 00:29:08.947
It reeks of mothballs.

00:29:09.427 --> 00:29:10.947
It's perfume, okay?

00:29:10.947 --> 00:29:13.026
- Mothball-scented perfume?
- How much essential balm

00:29:13.106 --> 00:29:14.506
did you use? Afraid of passing out?

00:29:14.546 --> 00:29:15.346
Reporter Du is here.

00:29:15.346 --> 00:29:16.187
Don't you feel hot?

00:29:16.227 --> 00:29:16.907
Reporter Du.

00:29:18.407 --> 00:29:19.867
Ms. Gao, I've never understood

00:29:19.907 --> 00:29:21.266
what "monkeys" mean.

00:29:22.026 --> 00:29:22.947
10,000-yuan households.

00:29:23.387 --> 00:29:23.907
They all are.

00:29:26.826 --> 00:29:28.506
Why do I feel like I've become a monkey?

00:29:29.266 --> 00:29:30.147
No, not at all.

00:29:30.266 --> 00:29:31.746
Then you are the reporter monkey.

00:29:33.467 --> 00:29:34.026
Ms. Gao.

00:29:34.227 --> 00:29:36.187
Your place is really like
a mini Wall Street.

00:29:37.147 --> 00:29:37.826
What Street?

00:29:38.467 --> 00:29:40.728
Wall Street is
the financial trading center in America.

00:29:41.106 --> 00:29:44.266
Your factory
is like the Wall Street in Yuehai.

00:29:44.867 --> 00:29:45.586
Exactly!

00:29:46.187 --> 00:29:48.187
Come on,
people of Wall Street in Yuehai.

00:29:48.546 --> 00:29:50.106
Get ready. Let's take a photo.

00:29:50.387 --> 00:29:51.227
Okay, I'll take that.

00:29:51.387 --> 00:29:51.947
Great!

00:29:52.147 --> 00:29:52.987
Don't touch my coat.

00:29:53.147 --> 00:29:54.227
Look at my camera.

00:29:54.506 --> 00:29:56.187
Hurry up. Or Changyuan will pass out.

00:29:56.346 --> 00:29:56.947
- Here.
- Looks good.

00:29:56.947 --> 00:29:57.586
Three.

00:29:57.667 --> 00:29:58.427
Hold him steady.

00:29:58.506 --> 00:29:59.227
Okay, hold him.

00:29:59.266 --> 00:29:59.826
Two.

00:30:01.066 --> 00:30:01.566
One.

00:30:08.746 --> 00:30:10.506
(Yuehai Town People's Government)
The newspaper photo is too blurry.

00:30:11.066 --> 00:30:12.746
What does Mr. Lin look like?

00:30:13.227 --> 00:30:14.546
(Yuehai Town Committee)
Didn't you read the report?

00:30:15.026 --> 00:30:17.306
Mr. Lin is a true pillar of strength.

00:30:17.546 --> 00:30:19.826
He devoted himself to work
and sacrificed for Yuehai.

00:30:20.346 --> 00:30:22.947
He completed Xingfu Road
in just three months,

00:30:24.187 --> 00:30:25.746
yet missed out his love.

00:30:26.346 --> 00:30:29.387
Lin Dongfu. What a good name.

00:30:29.427 --> 00:30:30.826
Yes, it sounds wonderful.

00:30:32.227 --> 00:30:32.987
Coming.

00:30:34.227 --> 00:30:35.147
Let's go.

00:30:36.786 --> 00:30:37.826
Hello.

00:30:38.306 --> 00:30:41.106
We're looking for Lin Dongfu,
Yuehai's deputy mayor.

00:30:41.586 --> 00:30:42.627
D-Do you know him?

00:30:44.826 --> 00:30:46.907
W-What do you want?

00:30:47.306 --> 00:30:49.867
We all adore him and want his autograph.

00:30:49.987 --> 00:30:50.627
- Right.
- Right.

00:30:51.346 --> 00:30:51.846
Right.

00:30:53.266 --> 00:30:54.106
It's you, right?

00:30:54.872 --> 00:30:56.627
Can you sign for us?

00:30:57.387 --> 00:30:58.227
Mr. Lin.

00:30:59.026 --> 00:31:00.187
Please sign for us.

00:31:01.786 --> 00:31:02.586
- Sign one for me.
- Me too.

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:03.306
Sign one for me.

00:31:03.306 --> 00:31:04.227
I was here first.

00:31:04.627 --> 00:31:05.707
- I want one too.
- Mine.

00:31:05.746 --> 00:31:07.106
I recognized him first.

00:31:07.147 --> 00:31:07.987
I was here first.

00:31:11.627 --> 00:31:12.707
Sign mine first.

00:31:14.227 --> 00:31:16.467
Ladies, excuse me.

00:31:16.506 --> 00:31:19.346
You made a mistake. The one you want
is on the motorcycle there.

00:31:20.026 --> 00:31:20.786
Hurry, let's go.

00:31:24.766 --> 00:31:27.286
- Deputy mayor.
- Move! It's dangerous.

00:31:28.147 --> 00:31:29.786
Deputy mayor, please.

00:31:30.346 --> 00:31:31.987
Can you sign for me?

00:31:32.266 --> 00:31:33.147
Please sign for us.

00:31:33.867 --> 00:31:34.867
We all adore you.

00:31:34.867 --> 00:31:36.266
We've been waiting here for long.

00:31:36.266 --> 00:31:37.147
Yes, please sign.

00:31:37.147 --> 00:31:38.187
What is it? Tell me.

00:31:39.147 --> 00:31:41.586
We all adore you
and want your autograph.

00:31:41.786 --> 00:31:42.826
Please sign for us.

00:31:44.627 --> 00:31:45.546
Please sign for us.

00:31:47.106 --> 00:31:49.147
Your eyes are all shining.

00:31:49.187 --> 00:31:50.187
Do you know who I am?

00:31:50.346 --> 00:31:52.147
You're our great town mayor of Yuehai!

00:31:52.387 --> 00:31:53.467
- Right.
- Right.

00:31:53.546 --> 00:31:54.627
Please sign for us.

00:31:54.707 --> 00:31:55.467
Yes, sign one.

00:31:55.586 --> 00:31:56.826
Please sign one for us.

00:31:57.846 --> 00:31:58.346
Okay.

00:31:58.346 --> 00:31:59.864
Line up. Line up.

00:32:00.824 --> 00:32:01.546
Okay.

00:32:07.826 --> 00:32:08.326
Okay.

00:32:08.546 --> 00:32:09.546
When did this happen?

00:32:09.987 --> 00:32:12.346
What exactly made you adore me so much?

00:32:12.467 --> 00:32:13.106
Tell me.

00:32:13.266 --> 00:32:14.586
You devote yourself to Yuehai.

00:32:14.746 --> 00:32:15.786
You're our hero!

00:32:16.227 --> 00:32:17.546
That wasn't just my doing.

00:32:18.147 --> 00:32:19.106
Thanks to everyone.

00:32:19.227 --> 00:32:19.727
Come on.

00:32:19.846 --> 00:32:20.746
- Thank you.
- Okay.

00:32:20.746 --> 00:32:21.467
It's my turn.

00:32:21.506 --> 00:32:22.006
Okay.

00:32:23.227 --> 00:32:24.066
All women?

00:32:25.266 --> 00:32:26.187
The Seven Fairies.

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:29.266
Well,

00:32:29.826 --> 00:32:32.116
there's another guy
who's also outstanding.

00:32:32.248 --> 00:32:33.346
Pay attention to him.

00:32:33.867 --> 00:32:34.627
Are you all single?

00:32:35.346 --> 00:32:36.746
Good, communicate more.

00:32:36.746 --> 00:32:39.187
- Okay.
- You care about our happiness.

00:32:39.227 --> 00:32:40.506
What about your own happiness?

00:32:40.746 --> 00:32:42.387
Working for everyone is my happiness.

00:32:43.627 --> 00:32:44.907
For all our happiness,

00:32:46.026 --> 00:32:46.987
mine doesn't matter.

00:32:49.947 --> 00:32:52.046
Alright, that's settled.

00:32:52.467 --> 00:32:53.546
You all can go now.

00:32:53.867 --> 00:32:54.387
Tell me if...

00:32:55.467 --> 00:32:56.667
All of you can go.

00:32:56.987 --> 00:32:57.667
I have to work.

00:32:58.586 --> 00:33:00.187
Come find me anytime.

00:33:00.227 --> 00:33:00.727
Okay.

00:33:01.187 --> 00:33:02.867
J-Jie Chunlai?

00:33:03.506 --> 00:33:05.147
You pronounced it wrong.

00:33:05.346 --> 00:33:06.526
It's alright. Xie.

00:33:06.987 --> 00:33:07.707
Xie Chunlai.

00:33:08.467 --> 00:33:09.746
You're not Lin Dongfu?

00:33:09.786 --> 00:33:11.387
We're here to see Mr. Lin.

00:33:13.227 --> 00:33:13.727
Who?

00:33:15.506 --> 00:33:17.066
I'm Xie Chunlai.

00:33:17.546 --> 00:33:19.306
Liar! Who are you really?

00:33:19.427 --> 00:33:21.467
We're looking
for deputy mayor Lin Dongfu.

00:33:21.667 --> 00:33:23.786
Exactly! How can you impersonate him?

00:33:23.987 --> 00:33:24.826
Ridiculous.

00:33:24.907 --> 00:33:26.266
You're not him. Why sign for us?

00:33:26.947 --> 00:33:27.867
- Let's go.
- Leave.

00:33:29.586 --> 00:33:30.266
Let's go.

00:33:37.938 --> 00:33:39.384
(Yuehai Town People's Government,
Yuehai Town Committee)

00:33:41.746 --> 00:33:43.746
Here's the thing.

00:33:44.227 --> 00:33:47.106
Today, when Xie was returning
to the town government office,

00:33:47.306 --> 00:33:48.266
he was surrounded

00:33:48.427 --> 00:33:50.467
by a group of women
at the main entrance.

00:33:50.947 --> 00:33:52.026
Then those women said,

00:33:52.227 --> 00:33:53.786
"Sign for us!"

00:33:54.106 --> 00:33:55.346
Xie was thrilled of course.

00:33:55.546 --> 00:33:57.826
He thought he was respected
among the masses,

00:33:58.306 --> 00:34:00.066
so he started signing.

00:34:00.346 --> 00:34:02.467
As soon as he finished writing his name,

00:34:02.627 --> 00:34:04.506
they just tore up the paper and left.

00:34:04.667 --> 00:34:06.786
They were actually
looking for Lin Dongfu.

00:34:09.387 --> 00:34:10.267
Am I right?

00:34:10.347 --> 00:34:10.907
Accident!

00:34:10.907 --> 00:34:11.867
Accident!

00:34:12.066 --> 00:34:13.387
Accident!

00:34:14.026 --> 00:34:16.546
It's great
that ladies are interested in Lin.

00:34:16.706 --> 00:34:17.347
Right.

00:34:17.387 --> 00:34:18.427
Wonderful!

00:34:18.506 --> 00:34:20.106
Reporter Du did an excellent thing.

00:34:20.787 --> 00:34:22.666
It's killing two birds with one stone.

00:34:22.747 --> 00:34:23.307
Right?

00:34:23.787 --> 00:34:25.787
Lin, seize the opportunity.

00:34:26.347 --> 00:34:28.387
Find someone you like and get married.

00:34:29.706 --> 00:34:32.146
I know you all mean well for me.

00:34:32.987 --> 00:34:33.987
But I...

00:34:35.467 --> 00:34:36.467
To be honest,

00:34:37.947 --> 00:34:40.787
I'm not afraid of any tough projects.

00:34:42.226 --> 00:34:42.947
But

00:34:43.226 --> 00:34:46.827
dating is completely different.

00:34:46.987 --> 00:34:49.146
It's to interact with women.

00:34:49.146 --> 00:34:49.646
I...

00:34:50.307 --> 00:34:52.066
I don't know how to interact with women.

00:34:52.347 --> 00:34:54.626
But you can't only interact with men.

00:34:54.706 --> 00:34:56.066
T-This won't do!

00:34:56.267 --> 00:34:57.467
Wake up, you!

00:34:57.706 --> 00:34:59.226
Don't tease Lin!

00:34:59.226 --> 00:34:59.787
Live wiser.

00:34:59.787 --> 00:35:00.467
Live wiser.

00:35:00.467 --> 00:35:01.226
Fix this.

00:35:01.226 --> 00:35:01.867
I'm telling you.

00:35:02.106 --> 00:35:02.706
Wake up!

00:35:03.186 --> 00:35:03.947
Mr. Xie.

00:35:04.947 --> 00:35:06.546
Is Mr. Xie inside?

00:35:07.146 --> 00:35:07.747
Yes.

00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:11.586
Mr. Xie, will you have time
after your bath?

00:35:11.626 --> 00:35:12.747
I'd like to chat with you.

00:35:17.387 --> 00:35:18.827
Reporter Du, I knew it was you.

00:35:18.987 --> 00:35:19.907
I always have time!

00:35:20.106 --> 00:35:20.666
Don't.

00:35:20.827 --> 00:35:22.427
Mr. Xie, y-you need to calm down

00:35:22.427 --> 00:35:24.267
and get dressed. Then we'll...

00:35:24.347 --> 00:35:25.106
Don't mind it.

00:35:25.267 --> 00:35:25.867
Let's chat.

00:35:25.867 --> 00:35:26.907
- No!
- Don't mind it.

00:35:26.907 --> 00:35:27.987
- We can chat here.
- No!

00:35:28.106 --> 00:35:28.606
My hand!

00:35:28.706 --> 00:35:29.267
My hand!

00:35:29.706 --> 00:35:30.226
It's okay.

00:35:30.226 --> 00:35:30.867
Get dressed.

00:35:30.867 --> 00:35:31.947
Wait for me.

00:35:31.987 --> 00:35:33.146
- Get dressed.
- Wait for me.

00:35:36.947 --> 00:35:38.546
(Canteen)
Let's talk about that printery.

00:35:38.747 --> 00:35:41.347
You started that printery, right?

00:35:42.066 --> 00:35:43.626
Of course.

00:35:44.226 --> 00:35:46.307
Xuemei's family was poor.

00:35:47.026 --> 00:35:49.427
Back then,
there were no ways to earn money.

00:35:49.827 --> 00:35:52.146
Later, there was the policy
of Reform and Opening-up.

00:35:52.347 --> 00:35:53.226
Right? The policy.

00:35:54.546 --> 00:35:58.387
She knew some sewing skills
and had good taste.

00:35:58.706 --> 00:36:00.506
That's why she fell for me.

00:36:00.787 --> 00:36:02.226
Right.

00:36:03.747 --> 00:36:04.267
Right?

00:36:04.387 --> 00:36:04.907
Right.

00:36:05.226 --> 00:36:06.947
I helped her pave the way,

00:36:07.307 --> 00:36:09.267
and then Chunmei Printery
was established.

00:36:09.787 --> 00:36:12.747
Why didn't you keep working with her?

00:36:12.747 --> 00:36:14.387
What do you mean?

00:36:14.506 --> 00:36:16.827
I've always been the director,
and she was just acting.

00:36:17.747 --> 00:36:18.666
Is it meaningful?

00:36:19.066 --> 00:36:20.827
Human life is limited.

00:36:21.747 --> 00:36:23.226
I want to dedicate my limited life

00:36:23.347 --> 00:36:25.867
to the boundless service of the people.

00:36:26.146 --> 00:36:26.827
Noble man.

00:36:27.066 --> 00:36:27.907
What?

00:36:28.347 --> 00:36:29.747
This isn't about being a leader,

00:36:30.026 --> 00:36:31.267
but building a cause.

00:36:31.907 --> 00:36:33.907
It's about constructing
a spiritual home.

00:36:34.387 --> 00:36:36.066
You saw nothing in Yuehai before.

00:36:36.307 --> 00:36:37.387
But in your mind now,

00:36:37.666 --> 00:36:39.226
there is the residential area,

00:36:39.307 --> 00:36:41.026
the cinema over there,

00:36:41.146 --> 00:36:42.307
the commercial district,

00:36:42.586 --> 00:36:43.666
the airport,

00:36:43.827 --> 00:36:46.827
and the train coming with smoke.

00:36:47.267 --> 00:36:49.427
What is that? It's hope.
What's coming is hope.

00:36:49.706 --> 00:36:51.467
Who bought these tables and benches?

00:36:51.747 --> 00:36:53.467
Who got all these bottles

00:36:53.827 --> 00:36:54.506
and jars?

00:36:54.787 --> 00:36:56.467
I bought every single one.

00:36:56.987 --> 00:36:57.506
Right?

00:36:57.867 --> 00:37:00.206
Well, notebooks and pens

00:37:00.347 --> 00:37:01.947
might cost just a few cents each,

00:37:02.146 --> 00:37:03.066
but they make a mickle.

00:37:03.146 --> 00:37:04.586
I had to find the best price.

00:37:04.987 --> 00:37:07.867
For such a major thing,
I need to be meticulous like a woman

00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:10.146
and decisive like a man.

00:37:10.546 --> 00:37:12.506
When it's time to decide,
I make the call.

00:37:12.626 --> 00:37:14.467
I'm like the chief steward.
My word is final.

00:37:15.666 --> 00:37:16.226
Mr. Tan.

00:37:16.626 --> 00:37:19.106
Is Reporter Du going to write
about Mr. Xie next?

00:37:23.066 --> 00:37:23.867
Yan, busy?

00:37:23.867 --> 00:37:24.387
Mr. Zheng,

00:37:25.106 --> 00:37:26.907
Ms. Li, Mr. Lin.

00:37:28.987 --> 00:37:32.166
Have you eaten?

00:37:32.427 --> 00:37:32.987
Not yet.

00:37:33.586 --> 00:37:34.387
Have you two eaten?

00:37:34.666 --> 00:37:35.467
- No.
- Not yet.

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:37.827
No one's eaten?
Then let's grab a bite here.

00:37:37.947 --> 00:37:38.447
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:37:38.467 --> 00:37:39.747
Let's talk while we eat.

00:37:39.947 --> 00:37:40.747
Okay, let's eat.

00:37:42.026 --> 00:37:42.586
Sit here.

00:37:44.706 --> 00:37:46.347
Yan, why are you setting up here today?

00:37:47.586 --> 00:37:49.747
I need to be close to the meat stall.

00:37:50.146 --> 00:37:52.146
Wherever the meat stall is,
that's where I set up.

00:37:52.347 --> 00:37:53.987
There's another meat stall in the west.

00:37:53.987 --> 00:37:55.546
If that spot's taken, I'd come here.

00:37:55.666 --> 00:37:57.066
If this spot's taken, I'd go there.

00:37:58.506 --> 00:38:00.146
Right, she's setting up between the two.

00:38:04.066 --> 00:38:04.626
Mr. Lin.

00:38:04.787 --> 00:38:06.347
You'll go to the construction site.

00:38:06.506 --> 00:38:07.827
Then I'll keep it brief.

00:38:09.907 --> 00:38:11.666
Well, Mr. Zheng told me

00:38:11.867 --> 00:38:14.747
you're thinking about marriage, right?

00:38:25.066 --> 00:38:25.566
Yes.

00:38:26.387 --> 00:38:28.387
Mr. Lin, I have a list here.

00:38:28.907 --> 00:38:30.427
It has names from various sources

00:38:30.586 --> 00:38:33.267
of many women who adore you.

00:38:33.706 --> 00:38:35.787
You could try communicating
and dating them.

00:38:36.026 --> 00:38:37.947
Some have photos, while some don't.

00:38:38.747 --> 00:38:39.747
I'll read them out.

00:38:40.106 --> 00:38:43.026
If any interest you,
feel free to interrupt.

00:38:43.307 --> 00:38:45.506
Wang Guifang, aged 29,

00:38:45.947 --> 00:38:48.568
state-owned wire factory worker,
with vocational school graduate.

00:38:48.747 --> 00:38:51.666
Hu Yuwen, aged 33,

00:38:52.026 --> 00:38:54.387
self-employed and divorced woman
without kids.

00:38:54.907 --> 00:38:57.867
Lin Qing, aged 28,

00:38:58.347 --> 00:39:00.506
unmarried teacher, with college diploma.

00:39:01.026 --> 00:39:01.907
Shen Qiandi.

00:39:02.146 --> 00:39:02.867
No photo for her.

00:39:02.867 --> 00:39:03.907
Here come the wontons!

00:39:04.026 --> 00:39:04.907
Aged 26.

00:39:07.427 --> 00:39:09.307
What are you doing? Why so flustered?

00:39:09.307 --> 00:39:09.987
Thanks.

00:39:12.827 --> 00:39:13.387
Let me.

00:39:13.626 --> 00:39:14.226
Sorry.

00:39:14.267 --> 00:39:15.666
Nothing. Are you hurt?

00:39:15.787 --> 00:39:16.287
No.

00:39:16.706 --> 00:39:17.867
It's alright, really.

00:39:17.907 --> 00:39:18.506
Let me.

00:39:18.787 --> 00:39:19.546
- It's fine.
- Sorry.

00:39:19.747 --> 00:39:20.307
It's fine.

00:39:24.146 --> 00:39:25.706
Mr. Lin, your wontons.

00:39:26.066 --> 00:39:26.566
So...

00:39:27.907 --> 00:39:29.026
Mr. Lin, I've got the pepper

00:39:29.347 --> 00:39:30.506
on your wontons.

00:39:30.546 --> 00:39:31.267
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

00:39:31.267 --> 00:39:31.787
It's fine.

00:39:31.947 --> 00:39:32.447
Thanks.

00:39:33.106 --> 00:39:35.427
What are you doing? Why so flustered?

00:39:37.146 --> 00:39:38.907
At your age, you should be more careful.

00:39:40.586 --> 00:39:42.666
Mr. Lin, give the photos back to me.

00:39:50.307 --> 00:39:52.706
Are you giving it up already?

00:39:53.226 --> 00:39:55.506
Why don't you fight for this?

00:39:56.226 --> 00:39:58.947
Well, let's simplify this.

00:39:59.186 --> 00:40:00.387
Just tell me,

00:40:00.586 --> 00:40:01.267
what do you like?

00:40:01.347 --> 00:40:02.827
Just list them out for me.

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:04.686
So I can search based on these criteria.

00:40:05.066 --> 00:40:06.566
Do it now.

00:40:07.267 --> 00:40:08.267
Yes, Mr. Lin.

00:40:08.546 --> 00:40:09.706
The entire town government

00:40:09.747 --> 00:40:12.347
has shown great concern
and care for your marriage.

00:40:12.867 --> 00:40:14.106
Please cooperate with us.

00:40:14.146 --> 00:40:16.307
Don't let down our good intentions.

00:40:18.226 --> 00:40:18.947
Anyone is fine.

00:40:19.387 --> 00:40:19.887
Well...

00:40:20.907 --> 00:40:22.626
As long as she's a working-class person.

00:40:25.347 --> 00:40:27.347
Anyone is fine?

00:40:28.026 --> 00:40:28.907
What did you say?

00:40:28.947 --> 00:40:30.586
Plenty of working-class people!

00:40:30.987 --> 00:40:33.146
What's the specific criteria?

00:40:35.146 --> 00:40:36.626
As long as she can cook.

00:40:38.947 --> 00:40:39.626
And?

00:40:42.307 --> 00:40:44.827
Not too old

00:40:45.427 --> 00:40:47.186
or too young.

00:40:49.467 --> 00:40:50.106
And?

00:40:51.506 --> 00:40:52.106
I know.

00:40:53.106 --> 00:40:54.307
So you're talking about her.

00:40:54.787 --> 00:40:55.586
Tell me earlier.

00:40:55.907 --> 00:40:57.427
I could've gone straight to her!

00:40:58.546 --> 00:40:59.146
Who is it?

00:40:59.427 --> 00:41:00.146
Ms. Xiao.

00:41:04.307 --> 00:41:05.927
What's wrong? So happy?

00:41:06.427 --> 00:41:07.427
I got it right, didn't I?

00:41:08.706 --> 00:41:10.546
If I'd known, I'd have told her.

00:41:11.146 --> 00:41:12.467
No, not Ms. Xiao.

00:41:12.867 --> 00:41:14.347
- Not her?
- Not her.

00:41:14.506 --> 00:41:15.787
Exactly. Nonsense.

00:41:15.947 --> 00:41:18.267
Ms. Xiao's husband is still alive.

00:41:19.146 --> 00:41:20.387
Ms. Xiao's husband is alive?

00:41:21.146 --> 00:41:22.827
If it's not Ms. Xiao, then who is it?

00:41:25.947 --> 00:41:26.666
Mr. Lin.

00:41:27.947 --> 00:41:29.827
What do you think of Sun Xiaoyan?

00:41:39.106 --> 00:41:39.987
Say something.

00:41:43.867 --> 00:41:44.787
Say something.

00:41:54.066 --> 00:41:56.626
Ms. Li, Mr. Zheng,
I-I need to go to the construction site.

00:41:59.226 --> 00:41:59.726
Wait.

00:42:00.506 --> 00:42:02.467
Wait. You haven't answered.

00:42:04.066 --> 00:42:04.566
Come back.

00:42:04.747 --> 00:42:06.827
Right. You haven't answered me yet.

00:42:07.307 --> 00:42:08.506
Mr. Lin, finished eating?

00:42:08.506 --> 00:42:09.006
Yes.

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:10.106
Ms. Li wants your answer.

00:42:10.106 --> 00:42:11.387
Fine. Anything's fine.

00:42:11.747 --> 00:42:13.066
Nonsense! Anything's fine?

00:42:13.706 --> 00:42:14.947
Nonsense!

00:42:15.546 --> 00:42:16.387
Lin Tofu.

00:42:17.307 --> 00:42:18.506
Just leaving. What a waste.

00:42:19.307 --> 00:42:20.307
He bit half of it.

00:42:21.026 --> 00:42:23.267
I-I'll eat it. I don't mind it.

00:42:28.626 --> 00:42:29.226
Ms. Li.

00:42:30.267 --> 00:42:32.146
Who told you about Sun Xiaoyan?

00:42:32.546 --> 00:42:33.427
Xie told you?

00:42:33.987 --> 00:42:35.106
She's not on the list.

00:42:35.987 --> 00:42:38.186
If she's not on the list,
why did you mention her?

00:42:38.706 --> 00:42:40.347
Mr. Lin likes her.

00:42:41.907 --> 00:42:44.586
Really? How do you know?

00:42:45.747 --> 00:42:46.347
Mr. Lin.

00:42:46.666 --> 00:42:47.267
Hello.

00:42:47.546 --> 00:42:48.226
Mr. Lin.

00:42:48.467 --> 00:42:49.146
Hello, Mr. Lin.

00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:50.226
- Hello.
- Mr. Lin.

00:42:50.987 --> 00:42:52.186
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

00:42:52.226 --> 00:42:52.867
Hello. Mr. Lin.

00:42:52.867 --> 00:42:53.506
Hello.

00:42:54.626 --> 00:42:56.787
- He smiled!
- Mr. Lin smiled!

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:10.990
♪Gently holding your face♪

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:18.588
